<p class="ct"><span class="epub-i">To Require a Boon</span></p>
<p class="tni">Rand al’Thor awoke and drew in a deep breath. He slipped from the blankets in his tent, leaving Aviendha slumbering there, and threw on a robe. The air smelled wet.</p>
<p class="tx">He was reminded, in passing, of mornings during his youth, rising before dawn to milk the cow, which would need milking twice a day. Eyes closed, he remembered the sounds of Tam—already up—cutting new fence posts in the barn. Remembering the chilly air, stomping his feet into his boots, washing his face with water left to warm beside the stove.</p>
<p class="tx">On any morning, a farmer could open his door and look out on a world that was still new. Crisp frost. The first, tentative calls of birds. Sunlight breaking the horizon, like the morning yawn of the world.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand stepped up to the flaps of his tent and drew them back, nodding to Katerin, a short, golden-haired Maiden who was on guard. He looked out on a world that was far from new. This world was old and tired, like a peddler who had been to the Spine of the World and back on foot. Tents crowded the Field of Merrilor, cook fires trailing pillars of smoke toward the still-dark morning sky.</p>
<p class="tx">Everywhere, men worked. Soldiers oiled armor. Smiths sharpened spearheads. Women prepared feathers for fletching arrows. Breakfasts were served from meal wagons to men who should have slept better than they had. Everyone knew these were their last moments before the storm arrived.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand closed his eyes. He could <span class="epub-i1">feel</span> it, the land itself, like a faint Warder bond. Beneath his feet, grubs crawled through the soil. The roots of the grasses continued to spread, ever so slowly, seeking nutrients. The skeletal trees were not dead, for water seeped through them. They slumbered. Bluebirds clustered in a nearby tree. They did not call out with the arrival of dawn. They huddled together, as if for warmth.</p>
<p class="tx">The land still lived. It lived like a man clinging to the edge of a cliff by his fingertips.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand opened his eyes. “Have my clerks returned from Tear?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes, Rand al’Thor,” said Katerin.</p>
<p class="tx">“Send word to the other rulers,” Rand said. “I will meet with them in one hour at the center of the field where I commanded no tents be placed.”</p>
<p class="tx">Katerin went off to relay his command, leaving three other Maidens nearby to guard. Rand let the tent flaps close in front of him and turned around, then jumped as he found Aviendha—as bare as the day she’d been born—standing in the tent.</p>
<p class="tx">“It is very difficult to sneak up on you, Rand al’Thor,” she announced with a smile. “The bond gives you too much of an advantage. I have to move very slowly, like a lizard at midnight, so that your sense of where I am does not change too quickly.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Light, Aviendha! Why do you need to sneak up on me in the first place?”</p>
<p class="tx">“For this,” she said, then jumped forward, snatching his head and kissing him, her body pressed against his.</p>
<p class="tx">He relaxed, letting the kiss linger. “Unsurprisingly,” he mumbled around her lips, “this is much more fun now that I don’t have to worry about freezing my bits off while doing it.”</p>
<p class="tx">Aviendha pulled back. “You should not speak of that event, Rand al’Thor.”</p>
<p class="tx">“But—”</p>
<p class="tx">“My <span class="epub-i1">toh</span> is paid, and I am now first-sister to Elayne. Do not remind me of a shame that is forgotten.”</p>
<p class="tx">Shame? Why would she be ashamed of that when just now … He shook his head. He could hear the land breathing, could sense a beetle on a leaf half a league away, but sometimes he could not fathom Aiel. Or maybe it was just women.</p>
<p class="tx">In this case, it was probably both.</p>
<p class="tx">Aviendha hesitated beside the tent’s barrel of fresh water. “I suppose that we will not have time for a bath.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Oh, you like baths now?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I have accepted them as a part of life,” she said. “If I am going to live in the wetlands, then I will adopt some wetlander customs. When they are not foolish.” Her tone indicated that most of them were.</p>
<p class="tx">“What’s wrong?” Rand asked, stepping up to her.</p>
<p class="tx">“Wrong?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Something bothers you, Aviendha. I can see it in you, feel it in you.”</p>
<p class="tx">She looked him over with a critical eye. Light, but she was beautiful. “You were much easier to manage before you received the ancient wisdom of your former self, Rand al’Thor.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I was?” he asked, smiling. “You didn’t act that way at the time.”</p>
<p class="tx">“That was when I was as a new child, inexperienced in Rand al’Thor’s boundless capacity to be frustrating.” She dipped her hands into the water and washed her face. “It is well; if I had known some of what was to come with you, I might have put on the white and never removed it.”</p>
<p class="tx">He smiled, then channeled, weaving Water and drawing the liquid from the barrel in a stream. Aviendha stepped back, watching with curiosity.</p>
<p class="tx">“You no longer seem bothered by the idea of a man channeling,” he noted as he fanned the water out into the air and heated it with a thread of Fire.</p>
<p class="tx">“There is no longer a reason to be bothered. If I were to be uncomfortable with you channeling, I would be behaving like a man refusing to forget a woman’s shame after her <span class="epub-i1">toh</span> has been met.” She eyed him.</p>
<p class="tx">“I can’t imagine anyone being that crass,” he said, tossing aside his robe and stepping up to her. “Here. This is a relic from that ‘ancient wisdom’ you apparently find so frustrating.”</p>
<p class="tx">He brought the water in, warmed perfectly, and shattered it into a thick misting spray that wove about them in a rush. Aviendha gasped, clutching his arm. She might be growing more comfortable with wetlander ways, but water still made her both uncomfortable and reverent.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand snatched some soap with Air and shaved it into part of the mix of water, sending a spinning whirl of bubbles around them, swirling up their bodies and pulling their hair into the air, twisting Aviendha’s about like a column before dropping it back lightly to her shoulders.</p>
<p class="tx">He used another wave of warm water to remove the soap, then pulled most of the wetness away, leaving them damp but not soaked. He dumped the water back into the barrel and, with a hint of reluctance, released <span class="epub-i1">saidin</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">Aviendha was panting. “That … That was completely crackbrained and irresponsible.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Thank you,” he said, fetching a towel and tossing it to her. “You would consider most of what we did during the Age of Legends to be crackbrained and irresponsible. That was a different time, Aviendha. There were many more channelers, and we were trained from a young age. We didn’t need to know things like warfare, or how to kill. We had eliminated pain, hunger, suffering, war. Instead, we used the One Power for things that might seem common.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You’d only assumed that you’d eliminated war,” Aviendha said with a sniff. “You were wrong. Your ignorance left you weak.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It did. I can’t decide if I would have changed things, though. There were many good years. Good decades, good centuries. We believed we were living in paradise. Perhaps that was our downfall. We wanted our lives to be perfect, so we ignored imperfections. Problems were magnified through inattention, and war might have become inevitable if the Bore hadn’t ever been made.” He toweled himself dry.</p>
<p class="tx">“Rand,” Aviendha said, stepping up to him. “Today, I will require a boon.” She laid her hand on his arm. The skin of her hand was rough, callused from her days as a Maiden. Aviendha would never be a milk-softened lady like those from the courts of Cairhien and Tear. Rand liked that just fine. Hers were hands that had known work.</p>
<p class="tx">“What boon?” he asked. “I’m not certain I could deny you anything today, Aviendha.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m not yet certain what it will be.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t understand.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You needn’t understand,” she said. “And you needn’t promise me you will agree. I felt I needed to give you warning, as one does not ambush a lover. My boon will require you to change your plans, perhaps in a drastic way, and it will be important.”</p>
<p class="tx">“All right…”</p>
<p class="tx">She nodded, as mystifying as ever, and began gathering up her clothing to dress for the day.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Egwene strode around a frozen pillar of glass in her dream. It almost looked like a column of light. What did it mean? She could not interpret it.</p>
<p class="tx">The vision changed, and she found a sphere. The world, she knew somehow. Cracking. Frantic, she tied it with cords, striving to hold it together. She could keep it from breaking, but it took so much effort … </p>
<p class="tx">She faded from the dream and started awake. She embraced the Source immediately and wove a light. Where was she?</p>
<p class="tx">She was wearing a nightgown and lying in bed back in the White Tower. Not her own rooms, which were still in disrepair following the assassins’ attack. Her study had a small sleeping chamber, and she’d bedded down in that.</p>
<p class="tx">Her head pounded. She could vaguely remember growing bleary-eyed the night before, listening in her tent at the Field of Merrilor to reports of Caemlyn’s fall. At some point during the late hours of the night, Gawyn had insisted that Nynaeve make a gateway back to the White Tower so Egwene could sleep in a bed, rather than on a pallet on the ground.</p>
<p class="tx">She grumbled to herself, rising. He’d probably been right, though she could remember feeling <span class="epub-i1">distinctly</span> annoyed at his tone. Nobody had corrected him on it, not even Nynaeve. She rubbed at her temples. The headache wasn’t as bad as those she’d had when Halima had been “caring” for her, but it did hurt mightily. Undoubtedly, her body was expressing displeasure at the lack of sleep she’d given it in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="tx">A short time later—dressed, washed and feeling a <span class="epub-i1">little</span> better—she left her rooms to find Gawyn sitting at Silviana’s desk, looking over a report, ignoring a novice who was lingering near the doorway.</p>
<p class="tx">“She’d hang you out the window by your toes if she saw you doing that,” Egwene said dryly.</p>
<p class="tx">Gawyn jumped. “It’s not a report from her stack,” he protested. “It’s the latest news from my sister about Caemlyn. It came by gateway for you just a few minutes ago.”</p>
<p class="tx">“And you’re reading it?”</p>
<p class="tx">He blushed. “Burn me, Egwene. It’s my <span class="epub-i1">home</span>. It wasn’t sealed. I thought…”</p>
<p class="tx">“It’s all right, Gawyn,” she said with a sigh. “Let’s see what it says.”</p>
<p class="tx">“There’s not much,” he said with a grimace, handing it to her. At a nod from him the novice scurried away. A short time later, the girl came back with a tray of wizened bellfruit, bread and a pitcher of milk.</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene sat down at her desk in the study to eat, feeling guilty as the novice left. The bulk of the Tower’s Aes Sedai and soldiers camped in tents on the Field of Merrilor while she dined on fruit, no matter how old, and slept in a comfortable bed?</p>
<p class="tx">Still, Gawyn’s arguments had made sense. If everyone thought she was in her tent on the Field, then potential killers would strike there. After her near-death at the hands of the Seanchan assassins, she was willing to accept a few extra precautions. Particularly those that helped her get a good night’s sleep.</p>
<p class="tx">“That Seanchan woman,” Egwene said, staring into her cup. “The one with the Illianer. Did you speak with her?”</p>
<p class="tx">He nodded. “I have some Tower guards watching the pair. Nynaeve vouched for them, in a way.”</p>
<p class="tx">“In a way?”</p>
<p class="tx">“She called the woman several variations of wool-headed, but said she probably wouldn’t do you any <span class="epub-i1">intentional</span> harm.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Wonderful.” Well, Egwene could make use of a Seanchan who was willing to talk. Light. What if she had to fight them and the Trollocs at the same time?</p>
<p class="tx">“You didn’t take your own advice,” she said, noting Gawyn’s red eyes as he sat down in the chair in front of her desk.</p>
<p class="tx">“Someone had to watch the door,” he said. “Calling for guards would have let everyone know that you were not at the Field.”</p>
<p class="tx">She took a bite of her bread—what <span class="epub-i1">had</span> it been made of?—and looked over the report. He was right, but she didn’t like the idea of him going without sleep on a day like this. The Warder bond would only help him so far.</p>
<p class="tx">“So the city is truly gone,” she said. “Walls breached, palace seized. The Trollocs didn’t burn all of the city, I see. Much of it, but not all.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes,” Gawyn said. “But it is obvious that Caemlyn is lost.” She felt his tension through the bond.</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Many people escaped, but it’s hard to say what the city population was before the attack, with so many refugees. Hundreds of thousands are likely dead.”</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene breathed out. A large army’s worth of people, wiped out in one night. That was probably only the start of the brutality to come. How many had died in Kandor so far? They could only guess.</p>
<p class="tx">Caemlyn had held much of the Andoran army’s food supply. She felt sick, thinking of so many people—hundreds of thousands of them—stumbling across the landscape away from the burning city. Yet that thought was less terrifying than the risk of starvation to Elayne’s troops.</p>
<p class="tx">She drew up a note to Silviana, requiring her to send all sisters strong enough to provide Healing for the refugees, and gateways to carry them to Whitebridge. Perhaps she could deliver supplies there, though the White Tower was strained as it was.</p>
<p class="tx">“Did you see the note at the bottom?” Gawyn asked.</p>
<p class="tx">She had not. She frowned, then scanned a sentence added at the bottom in Silviana’s hand. Rand al’Thor had demanded that everyone meet with him by … </p>
<p class="tx">She looked up at the room’s old, freestanding wooden clock. The meeting was in a half-hour. She groaned, then began shoveling the rest of her breakfast into her mouth. It wasn’t dignified, but Light <span class="epub-i1">burn</span> her if she was going to meet with Rand on an empty stomach.</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m going to throttle that boy,” she said, wiping her face. “Come on, let’s move.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We could always be last,” Gawyn said, rising. “Show him he doesn’t order us about.”</p>
<p class="tx">“And allow him the chance to meet with everyone else while I’m not there to counter what he has to say? I don’t like it, but Rand holds the reins right now. Everyone’s too curious to see what he’s going to do.”</p>
<p class="tx">She made a gateway back to her tent, into the corner that she’d set aside for Traveling. She and Gawyn stepped through and left the tent, into the clamor of the Field of Merrilor. People shouted outside; with a distant thunder of hooves, troops cantered and galloped as they took positions for the meeting. Did Rand realize what he’d done here? Putting soldiers together like this, leaving them edgy and uncertain, was like tossing a handful of fireworks into a stewpot and setting it onto the stove. Eventually, things were going to start exploding.</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene needed to manage the chaos. She strode out of her tent, Gawyn a step behind and to her left, and smoothed her face. The world needed an Amyrlin.</p>
<p class="tx">Silviana waited outside, dressed formally with stole and staff, as if she were going to a meeting of the Hall of the Tower.</p>
<p class="tx">“See to this, once the meeting starts,” Egwene said, handing her the note.</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes, Mother,” the woman said, then fell into step just behind Egwene and to her right. Egwene didn’t need to look to know that Silviana and Gawyn were pointedly ignoring each other.</p>
<p class="tx">At the west side of her camp, Egwene found a cluster of Aes Sedai arguing with one another. She passed through them and pulled silence in her wake. A groom brought her horse Sifter, a testy dapple gelding, and as she mounted, she looked at the Aes Sedai. “Sitters only.”</p>
<p class="tx">That produced a sea of calm, orderly complaints, each made with an Aes Sedai sense of authority. Each woman thought she had a right to be at the meeting. Egwene stared at them, and the women slowly came into line. They were Aes Sedai; they knew that squabbling was beneath them.</p>
<p class="tx">The Sitters gathered, and Egwene looked out over the Field of Merrilor as she waited. It was a large triangular area of Shienaran grassland, bounded on two sides by converging rivers—the Mora and the Erinin—and on the other by woods. The grass was broken by Dashar Knob, a rocky outcrop about a hundred feet high, with cliff walls, and on the Arafellin side of the Mora by Polov Heights, a flat-topped hill about forty feet high, with gradual slopes on three sides and a steeper slope on the river side. Southwest of Polov Heights lay an area of bogs, and nearby, the River Mora’s shallows, known as Hawal Ford, a convenient crossing place between Arafel and Shienar.</p>
<p class="tx">There was an Ogier <span class="epub-i1">stedding</span> nearby, opposite some old stone ruins to the north. Egwene had paid her respects soon after arriving, but Rand had not invited the Ogier to his meeting.</p>
<p class="tx">Armies were converging. Borderlander flags came in from the west, where Rand had made his camp. Perrin’s own flag flew among those. Odd, that Perrin should have a flag.</p>
<p class="tx">From the south, Elayne’s procession wound its way toward the meeting place, smack in the middle of the Field. The Queen rode at the front. Her palace had burned, but she kept her eyes forward. Between Perrin and Elayne, the Tairens and Illianers—Light, who had let those armies camp so near one another?—marched in separate columns, both bringing almost their entire forces.</p>
<p class="tx">Best to be quick. Her presence would calm the rulers, perhaps prevent problems. They wouldn’t like being near so many Aiel. Each clan but the Shaido was represented. She <span class="epub-i1">still</span> didn’t know if they’d support Rand or her. Some of the Wise Ones seemed to have listened to Egwene’s pleas, but she had received no commitments.</p>
<p class="tx">“Look there,” Saerin said, pulling up beside Egwene. “Did you invite the Sea Folk?”</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene shook her head. “No. I thought there was little chance they’d side against Rand.” In truth, after her meeting with the Windfinders in <span class="epub-i1">Tel’aran’rhiod</span>, she hadn’t wanted to swim in negotiations with them again. She was afraid she’d wake up and find that she’d traded away not only her firstborn, but the White Tower itself.</p>
<p class="tx">They put up quite a show, appearing through gateways near Rand’s camp, wearing their colorful clothing, Wavemistresses and Swordmasters as proud as monarchs.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Light,</span> Egwene thought. <span class="epub-i1">I wonder how long it’s been since a meeting of this scale occurred.</span> Nearly every nation was represented, and then some, considering the Sea Folk and the Aiel. Only Murandy, Arad Doman and the Seanchan-held lands were missing.</p>
<p class="tx">The last of the Sitters finally mounted and pulled up beside her. Eager to move forward, but not daring to show it, Egwene started a slow ride toward the meeting place. Bryne’s soldiers fell in and formed an escort of tromping boots and pikes held high. Their white tabards were emblazoned with the Flame of Tar Valon, but they did not outshine the Aes Sedai. The way they marched accented the women at their center. Other armies relied on the strength of arms. The White Tower had something better.</p>
<p class="tx">Each army converged on the meeting place, the center of the field, where Rand had ordered no tents erected. So many armies together on ground perfect for a charge. This had better not go wrong.</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne set precedent by leaving the vast bulk of her force halfway there, continuing on with a smaller guard of about a hundred men. Egwene did the same. Other leaders began to trickle forward, their retinues coming to rest in a large ring around the central field.</p>
<p class="tx">Sunlight shone down upon Egwene as she approached the center. She couldn’t help but notice the large, perfectly broken circle of clouds above the field. Rand did affect things in strange ways. He needed no announcement to say that he was in attendance, no banner. The clouds pulled back and sunlight shone down when he was near.</p>
<p class="tx">It did not seem that he’d arrived at the center yet, however. She met up with Elayne. “Elayne, I’m sorry,” she said, not for the first time.</p>
<p class="tx">The golden-haired woman kept her eyes forward. “The city is lost, but the city is not the nation. We must have this meeting, but do so quickly, so that I can return to Andor. Where is Rand?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Taking his time,” Egwene said. “He’s always been like that.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I have spoken to Aviendha,” Elayne said, her bay horse shifting and snorting. “She spent last night with him, but he wouldn’t tell her what he intends this day.”</p>
<p class="tx">“He has mentioned demands,” Egwene said, watching the rulers gather with their retinues. Darlin Sisnera, King of Tear, was first. He would support her, for all the fact that he owed Rand his crown. The Seanchan threat still bothered him deeply. The middle-aged man with a dark, pointed beard was not particularly handsome, but self-composed and sure of himself. He bowed from horseback to Egwene, and she held out her ring.</p>
<p class="tx">He hesitated, then dismounted and came forward, bowing his head and kissing the ring. “The Light illumine you, Mother.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I am glad to see you here, Darlin.”</p>
<p class="tx">“So long as your promise holds. Gateways to my homeland should the moment require it.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It will be done.”</p>
<p class="tx">He bowed again, eyeing a man riding up toward Egwene from the other side. Gregorin, Steward of Illian, was Darlin’s equal in many ways—but not all. Rand had named Darlin Steward of Tear, but the High Lords had asked for him to be crowned king. Gregorin remained merely a Steward. The tall man had lost weight recently, his round face—with its customary Illianer beard—starting to look sunken. He didn’t wait for Egwene to prod him; he swung from his horse and seized her hand, executing a flourishing bow and a kiss to the ring.</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m pleased the two of you could put aside differences to join me in this endeavor,” Egwene said, drawing their attention away from glares at one another.</p>
<p class="tx">“The Lord Dragon’s intentions are … troubling,” Darlin said. “He chose me to lead Tear because I opposed him when I felt it necessary. I believe he will listen to reason if I present it to him.”</p>
<p class="tx">Gregorin snorted. “The Lord Dragon do be perfectly reasonable. We do need to offer a good argument, and I do think he will listen.”</p>
<p class="tx">“My Keeper has some words for each of you,” Egwene said. “Please listen to what she has to say. Your cooperation will be remembered.”</p>
<p class="tx">Silviana rode forward and drew Gregorin aside to speak to him. There wasn’t much of importance to say, but Egwene had feared these two would end up chipping at one another. Silviana’s instruction was to keep them apart.</p>
<p class="tx">Darlin regarded her with a discerning gaze. He seemed to understand what she was doing, but didn’t complain as he mounted his horse.</p>
<p class="tx">“You seem troubled, King Darlin,” she said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Some old rivalries run deeper than the ocean’s depths, Mother. I can almost wonder if this meeting was the work of the Dark One, hoping that we would end up destroying one another and doing his work for him.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I understand,” Egwene said. “Perhaps it would be best if you advised your men—again, if you’ve already done so—that there are to be <span class="epub-i1">no</span> ‘accidents’ this day.”</p>
<p class="tx">“A wise suggestion.” He bowed, pulling back.</p>
<p class="tx">They were both with her, as was Elayne. Ghealdan would stand for Rand, if what Elayne said about Queen Alliandre was true. Ghealdan wasn’t so powerful that Alliandre worried her—the Borderlanders were another matter. Rand seemed to have won them over.</p>
<p class="tx">Each of their flags flew over their respective armies, and each ruler was in attendance save Queen Ethenielle, who was in Kandor trying to organize the refugees fleeing her homeland. She had left a sizable contingent for this meeting—including Antol, her eldest son—as if to state that what happened here was as important to Kandor’s survival as fighting on the border.</p>
<p class="tx">Kandor. The first casualty of the Last Battle. The entire country was said to be aflame. Would Andor be next? The Two Rivers? <span class="epub-i1">Steady,</span> Egwene thought.</p>
<p class="tx">It felt awful to have to consider who was “for” whom, but it was her duty to do so. Rand could not direct the Last Battle personally, as he would undoubtedly wish to do. His mission would be to fight the Dark One; he would have neither the presence of mind nor the time to act as a commanding general as well. She intended to come from this meeting with the White Tower acknowledged as leading the collected forces against the Shadow, and she would <span class="epub-i1">not</span> give up responsibility for the seals.</p>
<p class="tx">How much could she trust this man Rand had become? He wasn’t the Rand she’d grown up with. He was more akin to the Rand she’d come to know out in the Aiel Waste, only more confident. And, perhaps, more cunning. He had grown quite proficient at the Game of Houses.</p>
<p class="tx">None of these changes in him were terrible things, assuming he could still be reasoned with.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Is that the flag of Arad Doman?</span> she thought, surprised. It wasn’t just the flag, it was the <span class="epub-i1">King’s</span> flag, indicating he was riding with those forces that had just arrived on the field. Had Rodel Ituralde finally ascended to the throne, or had Rand picked someone else? The Domani king’s flag flew next to that of Davram Bashere, uncle to the Queen of Saldaea.</p>
<p class="tx">“Light.” Gawyn nudged his horse up beside hers. “That flag…”</p>
<p class="tx">“I see it,” Egwene said. “I’ll have to pin down Siuan: have her sources mentioned who took the throne? I was afraid the Domani would ride into battle without a leader.”</p>
<p class="tx">“The Domani? I was talking about <span class="epub-i1">that</span>.”</p>
<p class="tx">She followed his eyes. A new force was approaching, moving with apparent haste, under the banner of the red bull. “Murandy,” Egwene said. “Curious. Roedran has finally decided to join the rest of the world.”</p>
<p class="tx">The newly arrived Murandians made more show than they probably deserved. Their apparel, at least, was pretty: yellow and red tunics over mail; brass helmets with wide brims. The wide red belts bore the symbol of the charging bull. They kept their distance from the Andorans, wrapping around behind the Aiel forces and coming in from the northwest.</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene looked toward Rand’s camp. Still no sign of the Dragon himself.</p>
<p class="tx">“Come,” she said, nudging Sifter into motion toward the Murandian force. Gawyn fell in beside her, and Chubain brought a force of twenty soldiers as a guard.</p>
<p class="tx">Roedran was a corpulent man swathed in red and gold; she could practically hear the man’s horse groaning with each step. His thinning hair was more white than black, and he watched her with an unexpectedly keen expression. The King of Murandy was little more than ruler of one city, Lugard, but her reports indicated that this man wasn’t doing a bad job of expanding his rule. Given a few years, he might actually have a full kingdom to call his own.</p>
<p class="tx">Roedran held up a meaty hand, stopping his procession. She reined in her horse and waited for him to approach her, as would be customary. He didn’t.</p>
<p class="tx">Gawyn muttered a curse. Egwene let a smile tug at the edges of her lips. Warders could be useful, if only to express what she should not. Finally, she nudged her horse forward.</p>
<p class="tx">“So.” Roedran looked her over. “You’re the new Amyrlin. An Andoran.”</p>
<p class="tx">“The Amyrlin has no nationality,” Egwene said coolly. “I am curious to find you here, Roedran. When did the Dragon extend an invitation to you?”</p>
<p class="tx">“He didn’t.” Roedran waved for a cupbearer to bring him some wine. “I thought it was high time Murandy stopped being left out of events.”</p>
<p class="tx">“And through whose gateways did you arrive? Surely you didn’t cross Andor to reach here.”</p>
<p class="tx">Roedran hesitated.</p>
<p class="tx">“You came from the south,” Egwene said, studying him. “Andor. Elayne sent for you?”</p>
<p class="tx">“She did not <span class="epub-i1">send</span> for me,” Roedran snapped. “The bloody Queen promised me if I supported her cause, she’d release a proclamation of intention, promising not to invade Murandy.” He hesitated. “Besides, I’ve been curious to see this false Dragon. Everybody in the world seems to have taken leave of their senses regarding him.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You <span class="epub-i1">do</span> know what this meeting is about, don’t you?” Egwene said.</p>
<p class="tx">He waved a hand. “Talking this man out of his conquering ways, or something like that.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Good enough.” Egwene leaned forward. “I hear your rule is consolidating nicely, and that Lugard may actually have some real authority in Murandy for once.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes,” Roedran said, sitting up a bit straighter. “That is true.”</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene leaned forward further. “You’re welcome,” she said softly, then smiled. She turned Sifter and led her retinue away.</p>
<p class="tx">“Egwene,” Gawyn said softly, trotting his horse beside hers, “did you really just do that?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Does he look troubled?”</p>
<p class="tx">Gawyn glanced over his shoulder. “Very.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Excellent.”</p>
<p class="tx">Gawyn continued riding for a moment, then broke into a deep grin. “That was positively evil.”</p>
<p class="tx">“He’s as boorishly rude as reports have made him out to be,” Egwene said. “He can suffer a few nights spent wondering how the White Tower has been pulling strings in his realm. If I’m feeling particularly vengeful, I’ll set up some good secrets for him to unearth. Now, where <span class="epub-i1">is</span> that sheepherder? He has the audacity to demand that we…”</p>
<p class="tx">She trailed off as she saw him coming. Rand strode across the browning grass of the field, wearing red and gold. A tremendous bundle hovered in the air beside him, held up by weaves she could not see.</p>
<p class="tx">The grass greened at his feet.</p>
<p class="tx">It wasn’t a large change. Where he trod, the turf recovered, spreading from him like a soft wave of light through opening shutters. Men stepped back; horses stamped their hooves. Within minutes, the entire ring of troops stood on grass that lived again.</p>
<p class="tx">How long had it been since she’d seen a simple field of green? Egwene breathed out. Some of the gloom to the day had been lightened. “I’d give good coin to know how he does that,” she murmured under her breath.</p>
<p class="tx">“A weave?” Gawyn asked. “I’ve seen Aes Sedai make flowers bloom in winter.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I know of no weave that would be so extensive,” Egwene said. “It feels so <span class="epub-i1">natural</span>. Go see if you can find out how he’s doing it. Maybe one of the Aes Sedai with Asha’man Warders will let the truth out.”</p>
<p class="tx">Gawyn nodded, slipping away.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand continued his walk, trailed by that large floating bundle, Asha’man in black and an honor guard of Aiel. The Aiel spurned regular ranks, sweeping the land like a swarm, fanning out. Even soldiers who followed Rand shied back from the Aiel. For many of the older soldiers, a wave of browns and tans like that meant death.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand walked calmly, purposefully. The cloth bundle he carried with Air began to unravel in front of him. Large swaths of canvas rippled in the wind before Rand, braiding with one another, leaving long trails behind themselves. Wooden poles and metal stakes fell from inside them, and Rand caught those in unseen threads of Air, spinning them.</p>
<p class="tx">He never broke stride. He didn’t look at the maelstrom of cloth, wood and iron, as canvas rippled in front of him like fish from the depths. Small clods of soil erupted from the ground. Some soldiers jumped.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">He’s grown into quite the showman,</span> Egwene thought as the poles spun and came down in the holes. Sweeping bands of cloth wrapped around them, tying themselves. In seconds, a massive pavilion settled into place, the Dragon banner flapping from one end, the banner with the ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai on the other.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand didn’t break stride as he reached the pavilion, cloth sides parting for him. “You may each bring five,” he announced as he stepped inside.</p>
<p class="tx">“Silviana,” Egwene said, “Saerin, Romanda, Lelaine. Gawyn will be our fifth when he returns.”</p>
<p class="tx">Sitters behind suffered the decision in silence. They couldn’t complain about her taking her Warder for protection or her Keeper for support. The other three she’d chosen were widely considered among the most influential in the Tower, and together the four she brought included two Aes Sedai each from Salidar and the White Tower loyalists.</p>
<p class="tx">The other rulers allowed Egwene to enter before them. All understood that this confrontation was, at its core, between Rand and Egwene. Or, rather, the Dragon and the Amyrlin Seat.</p>
<p class="tx">There were no chairs inside the pavilion, though Rand hung <span class="epub-i1">saidin</span> globes of light at the corners, and one of the Asha’man deposited a small table at the center. She did a quick count. Thirteen glowing globes.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand stood facing her, arms behind his back, hand clasping his other forearm as had become his habit. Min stood at his side, one hand on his arm.</p>
<p class="tx">“Mother,” he said, nodding his head.</p>
<p class="tx">So he would pretend respect, would he? Egwene nodded back. “Lord Dragon.”</p>
<p class="tx">The other rulers and their small retinues filed in, many doing so with timidity until Elayne swept in, the sorrow on her face lightening as Rand smiled warmly at her. The wool-headed woman was still impressed with Rand, pleased with how he’d managed to bully everyone into coming here. Elayne considered it a matter of pride when he did well.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">And you don’t feel a small measure of pride?</span> Egwene asked herself. <span class="epub-i1">Rand al’Thor, once simple village boy and your near-betrothed, now the most powerful man in the world? You don’t feel proud of what he’s done?</span></p>
<p class="tx">Perhaps a little.</p>
<p class="tx">The Borderlanders entered, led by King Easar of Shienar, and there was nothing timid about them. The Domani were led by an older man that Egwene did not know.</p>
<p class="tx">“Alsalam,” Silviana whispered, sounding surprised. “He has returned.”</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene frowned. Why hadn’t any of her informants told her he had shown up? Light. Did Rand know that the White Tower had tried to take him into custody? Egwene herself had discovered that fact only a few days before, buried in a pile of Elaida’s papers.</p>
<p class="tx">Cadsuane entered, and Rand nodded to her, as if giving permission. She didn’t bring five, but neither did he seem to require her to be counted among Egwene’s five. That struck her as a bothersome precedent. Perrin stepped in with his wife, and they stayed to the side. Perrin folded his tree-trunk arms, wearing his new hammer at his belt. He was far easier to read than Rand was. He was worried, but he trusted Rand. Nynaeve did, too, burn her. She took her position near Perrin and Faile.</p>
<p class="tx">The Aiel clan chiefs and Wise Ones entered in a large mass—Rand’s “Bring only five” probably meant that each clan chief could bring five. Some Wise Ones, including Sorilea and Amys, made their way to Egwene’s side of the tent.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Light bless them,</span> Egwene thought, releasing a held breath. Rand’s eyes flickered toward the women, and Egwene caught a tightening of his lips. He was surprised that all the Aiel didn’t back him, each and every one.</p>
<p class="tx">King Roedran of Murandy was one of the last to enter the tent, and Egwene noticed something curious as he did. Several of Rand’s Asha’man—one of them Arafellin—moved in behind Roedran. Others, near Rand, looked as alert as cats who had seen a wolf wander by.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand stepped over to the shorter, wider man and looked down into his eyes. Roedran stuttered for a moment, then started wiping his brow with a handkerchief. Rand continued to stare at him.</p>
<p class="tx">“What is it?” Roedran demanded. “You’re the Dragon Reborn, so they say. I do not know that <span class="epub-i1">I’d</span> have let you—”</p>
<p class="tx">“Stop,” Rand said, raising a finger.</p>
<p class="tx">Roedran quieted immediately.</p>
<p class="tx">“Light burn me,” Rand said. “You’re not him, are you?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Who?” Roedran asked.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand turned away from him, waving his hand to make the watchful Asha’man stand down. They did so reluctantly. “I thought for certain…” Rand said, shaking his head. “Where <span class="epub-i1">are</span> you?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Who?” Roedran asked loudly, almost squeaking.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand ignored him. The flaps to the pavilion had finally stilled, everyone inside. “So,” Rand said. “We are all here. Thank you for coming.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It’s not like we did have much of a bloody choice,” Gregorin grumbled. He’d brought a handful of Illianer nobility with him as his five, all members of the Council of Nine. “We did be caught between you and the White Tower itself. Light burn us.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You know by now,” Rand continued, “that Kandor has fallen and Caemlyn has been taken by the Shadow. The last remnants of Malkier are under assault at Tarwin’s Gap. The end is upon us.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Then why are we standing here, Rand al’Thor?” demanded King Paitar of Arafel. The aging man had only a thin ribbon of gray hair remaining on his head, but he was still broad-shouldered and intimidating. “Let us put an end to this posturing and be to it, man! There is fighting to be done.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I promise you fighting, Paitar,” Rand said softly. “All that you can stomach, and then some. Three thousand years ago, I met the Dark One’s forces in battle. We had the wonders of the Age of Legends, Aes Sedai who could do things that would make your mind reel, <span class="epub-i1">ter’angreal</span> that could enable people to fly and make them immune to blows. We still <span class="epub-i1">barely won</span>. Have you considered that? We face the Shadow in much the same state as it was then, with Forsaken who have not aged. But we are not the same people, not by far.”</p>
<p class="tx">The tent fell silent. Flaps blew in the breeze.</p>
<p class="tx">“What are you saying, Rand al’Thor?” Egwene said, folding her arms. “That we are doomed?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m saying we need to plan,” Rand said, “and present a unified attack. That we did poorly last time, and it nearly cost us the war. We each thought we knew the best way to go.” He met Egwene’s eyes. “In those days, every man and woman considered themselves to be the leader on the field. An army of generals. <span class="epub-i1">That</span> is why we nearly lost. <span class="epub-i1">That</span> is what left us with the taint, the Breaking, the madness. I was as guilty of it as anyone. Perhaps the most guilty.</p>
<p class="tx">“I will not have that happen again. I will not save this world only to have it broken a second time! I will not die for the nations of humanity, only to have them turn upon one another the moment the last Trolloc falls. You’re planning it. Light burn me, I <span class="epub-i1">know</span> that you are!”</p>
<p class="tx">It would have been easy to miss the glances that Gregorin and Darlin shot at one another, or the covetous way Roedran watched Elayne. Which nations would be broken by this conflict, and which would step in—out of altruism—to help its neighbors? How quickly would altruism become greed, the chance to hold another throne?</p>
<p class="tx">Many of the rulers here were decent people. It took more than a decent person to hold that much power and not look afield. Even Elayne had gobbled up another country when the opportunity presented itself. She would do so again. It was the nature of rulers, the nature of nations. In Elayne’s case, it even seemed appropriate, as Cairhien would be better off beneath her rule than it had been.</p>
<p class="tx">How many would assume the same? That they, of course, could rule better—or restore order—in another land?</p>
<p class="tx">“Nobody wants war,” Egwene said, drawing the crowd’s attention. “However, I think what you are trying to do here is beyond your calling, Rand al’Thor. You cannot change human nature and you cannot bend the world to your whims. Let people live their lives and choose their own paths.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I <span class="epub-i1">will not</span>, Egwene,” Rand said. There was a fire in his eyes, like the one she’d seen when he first sought to bring the Aiel to his cause. Yes, that emotion seemed very like Rand—frustration that people didn’t see the world as clearly as he thought he did.</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t see what else you can do,” Egwene said. “Would you appoint an emperor, someone to rule over us all? Would you become a true tyrant, Rand al’Thor?”</p>
<p class="tx">He didn’t snap back a retort. He held out his hand to the side, and one of his Asha’man slipped a rolled paper into it. Rand took it and placed it on the table. He used the Power to unroll it and to keep it flat.</p>
<p class="tx">The oversized document was filled with tight, cramped letters. “I call it the Dragon’s Peace,” Rand said softly. “And it is one of the three things which I will require of you. Your payment, to me, in exchange for my life.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Let me see that.” Elayne reached for it, and Rand obviously let it go, because she was able to snatch it off the table before any of the other surprised rulers.</p>
<p class="tx">“It locks the borders of your nations to their current positions,” Rand said, arms behind his back again. “It forbids country from attacking country, and it requires the opening of a great school in each capital—fully funded and with doors open to those who wish to learn.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It does more than that,” Elayne said, one finger to the document as she read. “Attack another land, or enter into a minor armed border dispute, and the other nations of the world have an obligation to defend the country attacked. Light! Tariff restrictions to prevent the strangling of economies, barriers on marriage between rulers of nations unless the two lines of rule are clearly divided, provisions for stripping the land from a lord who starts a conflict … Rand, you <span class="epub-i1">really</span> expect us to sign this?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="tx">The outrage from the rulers was immediate, though Egwene stood calmly, and shot a few glances at the other Aes Sedai. They seemed troubled. As well they should be—and this was only part of Rand’s “price.”</p>
<p class="tx">The rulers muttered, each wanting a chance at the document, but not wanting to shoulder in and look over Elayne’s shoulder. Fortunately, Rand had thought ahead, and smaller versions of the document were distributed.</p>
<p class="tx">“But there are very good reasons for conflict, sometimes!” Darlin said, looking over his document. “Such as creating a buffer between you and an aggressive neighbor.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Or what if some people from our country do be living across the border?” Gregorin added. “Do we not have the mandate to step in and protect them, if they do be oppressed? Or what if someone like the Seanchan do claim land that is ours? Forbidding war do seem ridiculous!”</p>
<p class="tx">“I agree,” Darlin said. “Lord Dragon, we should have the <span class="epub-i1">mandate</span> to defend land that is rightfully ours!”</p>
<p class="tx">“I,” Egwene said, cutting through the arguments, “am more interested to hear his other two requirements.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You know one of them,” Rand said.</p>
<p class="tx">“The seals,” Egwene said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Signing this document would mean nothing to the White Tower,” Rand said, apparently ignoring the comment. “I can’t very well forbid all of you to influence the others; that would be foolishness.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It’s <span class="epub-i1">already</span> foolishness,” Elayne said.</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne was not feeling so proud of him any longer, Egwene thought.</p>
<p class="tx">“And as long as there are political games to be played,” Rand continued to Egwene, “the Aes Sedai will master them. In fact, this document benefits you. The White Tower always <span class="epub-i1">has</span> believed war to be, as they say, shortsighted. Instead, I demand something else of you. The seals.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I am their Watcher.”</p>
<p class="tx">“In name only. They were only just discovered, and I possess them. It is out of respect for your traditional title that I approached you about them first.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Approached me? You didn’t make a request,” she said. “You didn’t make a <span class="epub-i1">demand</span>. You came, told me what you were going to do and walked away.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I have the seals,” he repeated. “And I will break them. I won’t allow anything, not even you, to come between me and protecting this world.”</p>
<p class="tx">All around them arguments over the document continued, rulers muttering with their confidants and neighbors. Egwene stepped forward, facing Rand across the small table, the two of them ignored for the moment. “You won’t break them if I stop you, Rand.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Why would you want to stop me, Egwene? Give me a single reason why it would be a bad idea.”</p>
<p class="tx">“A single reason other than that it will let the Dark One loose on the world?”</p>
<p class="tx">“He was not loose during the War of Power,” Rand said. “He could touch the world, but the Bore being opened will not loose him. Not immediately.”</p>
<p class="tx">“And what was the cost of letting him touch the world? What are they now? Horrors, terrors, destruction. You know what is happening to the land. The dead walking, the strange twisting of the Pattern. This is what happens with the seals only weakened! What happens if we actually break them? The Light only knows.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It is a risk that must be taken.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t agree. Rand, you don’t know what releasing his seals will do—you don’t know if it might let him escape. You don’t know how close he was to getting out when the Bore was last secured. Shattering those seals could destroy the world itself! What if our only hope lies in the fact that he’s hindered this time, not completely free?”</p>
<p class="tx">“It won’t work, Egwene.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You don’t know that. How can you?”</p>
<p class="tx">He hesitated. “Many things in life are uncertain.”</p>
<p class="tx">“So you <span class="epub-i1">don’t</span> know,” she said. “Well, I have been looking, reading, listening. Have you read the works of those who have studied this, thought about it?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Aes Sedai speculation.”</p>
<p class="tx">“The only information we have, Rand! Open the Dark One’s prison and all could be lost. We have to be more careful. This is what the Amyrlin Seat is for, this is part of why the White Tower was founded in the first place!”</p>
<p class="tx">He actually hesitated. Light, he was <span class="epub-i1">thinking</span>. Could she be getting through to him?</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t like it, Egwene,” Rand said softly. “If I go up against him and the seals are not broken, my only choice will be to create another imperfect solution. A patch, even worse than the one last time—because with the old, weakened seals there, I’ll just be spreading new plaster over deep cracks. Who knows how long the seals would last this time? In a few centuries, we could have this same fight all over again.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Is that so bad?” Egwene said. “At least it’s sure. You sealed the Bore last time. You know how to do it.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We could end up with the taint again.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We’re ready for it, this time. No, it wouldn’t be ideal. But Rand … do we really want to risk this? Risk the fate of every living being? Why not take the simple path, the known path? Mend the seals again. Shore up the prison.”</p>
<p class="tx">“No, Egwene.” Rand backed away. “Light! Is this what it’s about? You want <span class="epub-i1">saidin</span> to be tainted again. You Aes Sedai … you’re threatened by the idea of men who can channel, undermining your authority!”</p>
<p class="tx">“Rand al’Thor, don’t you <span class="epub-i1">dare</span> be that level of a fool.”</p>
<p class="tx">He met her eyes. The rulers seemed to be paying little attention to this conversation, despite the fact that the world depended on it. They pored over Rand’s document, muttering in outrage. Perhaps that was what he had intended, to distract them with the document, then pounce for the real fight.</p>
<p class="tx">Slowly, the rage melted from his face, and he raised his hand to the side of his head. “Light, Egwene. You can still do it, like the sister I never had—tie my mind in knots and have me raving at you and loving you at the same time.”</p>
<p class="tx">“At least I’m consistent,” she said. They were now speaking very softly, leaning across the table toward one another. To the side, Perrin and Nynaeve were probably close enough to hear, and Min had joined them. Gawyn had returned, but he kept his distance. Cadsuane rounded the room, looking in the other direction—too pointedly. She was listening in.</p>
<p class="tx">“I am not making this argument in some fool hope to restore the taint,” Egwene said. “You know I’m better than that. This is about protecting humankind. I can’t believe you are willing to risk everything on a slender chance.”</p>
<p class="tx">“A slender chance?” Rand said. “We’re talking about entering darkness instead of founding another Age of Legends. We could have peace, an end to suffering. Or we could have another Breaking. Light, Egwene. I don’t know for certain if I <span class="epub-i1">could</span> mend the seals, or make new ones, in the same way. The Dark One has to be ready for that plan.”</p>
<p class="tx">“And you have another one?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’ve been telling it to you. I break the seals to get rid of the old, imperfect plug, and try again in a new way.”</p>
<p class="tx">“The world itself is the cost of failure, Rand.” She thought a moment. “There’s more here. What aren’t you telling me?”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand looked hesitant, and for a moment, he seemed the child she’d once caught sneaking bites of Mistress Cauthon’s pies with Mat. “I’m going to kill him, Egwene.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Who?”</p>
<p class="tx">“The Dark One.”</p>
<p class="tx">She drew back in shock. “I’m sorry. What did you—”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m going to <span class="epub-i1">kill</span> him,” Rand said passionately, leaning in. “I’m going to end the Dark One. We will never have true peace so long as he is there, lurking. I’ll rip open the prison, I’ll enter it and I’ll face him. I’ll build a new prison if I have to, but first, I’m going to try to end all of this. Protect the Pattern, the Wheel, for good.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Light, Rand, you’re <span class="epub-i1">insane</span>!”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes. That is part of the price I have paid. Fortunately. Only a man with shaken wits would be daring enough to try this.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’ll fight you, Rand,” she whispered. “I won’t let you pull all of us into this. Listen to reason. The White Tower should be guiding you here.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’ve known the White Tower’s guidance, Egwene,” he replied. “In a box, beaten each day.”</p>
<p class="tx">The two locked eyes across the table. Nearby, other arguments continued.</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t mind signing this,” Tenobia said. “It looks fine to me.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Bah!” Gregorin snarled. “You Borderlanders never care anything for southern politics. You’ll sign it? Well, good for you. I, however, won’t chain my country to the wall.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Curious,” Easar said. The calm man shook his head, pure white topknot bobbing. “As I understand, it’s not your country, Gregorin. Unless you’re assuming that the Lord Dragon will die, and that Mattin Stepaneos will not demand his throne back. He may be willing for the Lord Dragon to wear the Laurel Crown, but not you, I’m sure.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Isn’t all of this meaningless?” Alliandre asked. “The <span class="epub-i1">Seanchan</span> are our worry now, aren’t they? Peace can never exist so long as they are there.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes,” Gregorin said. “The Seanchan and those cursed Whitecloaks.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We will sign it,” Galad said. Somehow the Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light had ended up holding the official copy of the document. Egwene didn’t look at him. It was hard not to stare. She loved Gawyn, and not Galad, but … well … it was hard not to stare.</p>
<p class="tx">“Mayene will sign it as well,” Berelain said. “I find the Lord Dragon’s will to be perfectly just.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Of course <span class="epub-i1">you’d</span> sign it.” Darlin sniffed. “My Lord Dragon, this document seems designed to protect the interests of some nations more than others.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I want to hear what his third requirement is,” Roedran said. “I don’t care anything for talk of the seals; that is Aes Sedai business. He claimed there were three requirements, and we have heard only two.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand raised an eyebrow. “The third and final price—the last thing you will pay me in exchange for my life on the slopes of Shayol Ghul—is this: I command your armies for the Last Battle. Utterly and completely. You do as I say, go where I say, fight where I say.”</p>
<p class="tx">This caused a larger eruption of arguments. It was obviously the least outrageous of the three demands, though it <span class="epub-i1">was</span> impossible for reasons Egwene had already determined.</p>
<p class="tx">The rulers treated it as an attack on their sovereignty. Gregorin glowered at Rand through the din, only maintaining the most threadbare respect. Amusing, since he had the least authority of them all. Darlin shook his head, and Elayne’s face was <span class="epub-i1">livid</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">Those on Rand’s side argued back, primarily the Borderlanders. <span class="epub-i1">They’re desperate,</span> Egwene thought. <span class="epub-i1">They’re being overrun.</span> They probably thought that if command were given to the Dragon, he would immediately march to the defense of the Borderlands. Darlin and Gregorin would never agree to that. Not with the Seanchan breathing down their necks.</p>
<p class="tx">Light, what a mess.</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene listened to the arguments, hoping they would set Rand on edge. Once, they might have. Now, he stood and watched, arms folded behind his back. His face became serene, though she was increasingly certain that was a mask. She’d seen flashes of his temper inside. Rand certainly was more in control of himself now, but he was by no means emotionless.</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene actually found herself smiling. For all of his complaints about Aes Sedai, for all of his insistence that he wouldn’t be controlled by them, he was acting more and more like one of them himself. She prepared to speak and take control, but something in the tent changed. A … feeling to the air. Her eyes seemed drawn to Rand. Sounds came from outside, sounds she couldn’t place. A faint cracking sound? What was he doing?</p>
<p class="tx">The arguments trailed off. One by one the rulers turned toward him. The sunlight outside dimmed, and she was glad for those spheres of light he had made.</p>
<p class="tx">“I need you,” Rand said softly to them. “The land itself needs you. You argue; I knew that you would, but we no longer have time for arguments. Know this. You cannot talk me out of my designs. You cannot make me obey you. No force of arms, nor weave of the One Power, can <span class="epub-i1">make</span> me face the Dark One for you. I must do it of my own choice.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You would really toss the world for this, Lord Dragon?” Berelain asked.</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene smiled. The lightskirt suddenly didn’t seem so certain of the side she had chosen.</p>
<p class="tx">“I won’t have to,” Rand said. “You’ll sign it. To fail to do so means death.”</p>
<p class="tx">“So it’s extortion,” Darlin snapped.</p>
<p class="tx">“No,” Rand said, smiling toward the Sea Folk, who had said little as they stood near Perrin. They had simply read the document and nodded among themselves, as if impressed. “No, Darlin. It’s not extortion … it’s an arrangement. I have something you want, something you need. Me. My blood. I will die. We’ve all known this from the start; the Prophecies demand it. As you wish this of me, I will sell it to you in exchange for a legacy of peace to balance out the legacy of destruction I gave the world last time.”</p>
<p class="tx">He scanned the meeting, looking at each ruler in turn. Egwene felt his determination almost like a physical thing. Perhaps it was his <span class="epub-i1">ta’veren</span> nature, or perhaps it was just the weight of the moment. A pressure rose inside the pavilion, making it difficult to breathe.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">He’s going to do it,</span> she thought. <span class="epub-i1">They’ll complain, but they’ll bend.</span></p>
<p class="tx">“No,” Egwene said loudly, her voice breaking the air. “No, Rand al’Thor, we will not be bullied into signing your document, into giving you sole control of this battle. And you’re an utter fool if you think I believe you’d let the world—your father, your friends, all those you love, all of humanity—be slaughtered by Trollocs if we defy you.”</p>
<p class="tx">He met her eyes, and suddenly she wasn’t certain. Light, he wouldn’t <span class="epub-i1">really</span> refuse, would he? Would he really sacrifice the world?</p>
<p class="tx">“You dare call the Lord Dragon foolish?” demanded an Asha'man.</p>
<p class="tx">“The Amyrlin is <span class="epub-i1">not</span> to be spoken to that way,” Silviana said, stepping up beside Egwene.</p>
<p class="tx">The arguments began again, this time louder. Rand kept Egwene’s eyes, and she saw the flush of anger rise in his face. The shouting rose, tension mounting. Unrest. Anger. Old hatreds, flaring anew, fueled by terror.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand rested his hand on the sword he wore these days—the one with the dragons on the scabbard—his other arm folded behind his back.</p>
<p class="tx">“I <span class="epub-i1">will</span> have my price, Egwene,” he growled.</p>
<p class="tx">“Require if you wish, Rand. You are <span class="epub-i1">not</span> the Creator. If you go to the Last Battle with this foolishness, we’re all dead anyway. If I fight you, then there is a chance I can change your mind.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Ever the White Tower has been a spear at my throat,” Rand snapped. “Ever, Egwene. And now you really have become one of them.”</p>
<p class="tx">She met his stare. Inside, however, she was beginning to lose certainty. What if these negotiations did break down? Would she really drive her soldiers to fight Rand’s?</p>
<p class="tx">She felt as if she had tripped over a rock at the top of a cliff and was tipping toward the fall. There had to be a way to stop this, to salvage it!</p>
<p class="tx">Rand started to turn away. If he left the pavilion, that would be the end of it.</p>
<p class="tx">“Rand!” she said.</p>
<p class="tx">He froze. “I will not budge, Egwene.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Don’t do this,” she said. “Don’t throw it all away.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It cannot be helped.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes it can! All you have to do is stop being such a Light-burned, wool-headed, stubborn fool for once!”</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene drew herself back. How could she have spoken to him as if they were back in Emond’s Field, at their beginning?</p>
<p class="tx">Rand stared at her for a moment. “Well, you could certainly stop being a spoiled, self-certain, unmitigated <span class="epub-i1">brat</span> for once, Egwene.” He threw up his arms. “Blood and ashes! This was a waste of time.”</p>
<p class="tx">He was very nearly right. Egwene didn’t notice someone new entering the tent. Rand did, however, and he spun as the flaps parted and let in light. He frowned at the interloper.</p>
<p class="tx">His frown died as soon as he saw the person who entered.</p>
<p class="tx">Moiraine.</p>
