<div class="calibre8">
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Faile walked the camp in the waning evening light, making her way toward the quartermaster’s tent. Perrin had sent their group of scouts through the gateway to Cairhien; they’d return the next morning.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin was still brooding about the Whitecloaks. Over the last several days, the two armies had exchanged several letters, Perrin trying to maneuver for a second, more formal parley while the Whitecloaks insisted on a battle. Faile had given Perrin choice words about sneaking off to meet with the Whitecloaks without her.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin was stalling as he let Elyas and the Aiel scout the Whitecloaks to try to find a way to sneak their people out, but it was unlikely to be an option. He’d succeeded back in the Two Rivers, but there had been only a handful of captives then. Now there were hundreds.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin was not dealing well with his guilt. Well, Faile would talk with him shortly. She continued through the camp, passing the Mayener section to her left, with banners flying high.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">I will have to deal with that one soon as well,</span> Faile thought, looking up at Berelain’s banner. The rumors about her and Perrin were problematic. She’d suspected that Berelain might try something in Faile’s absence, but taking him into her tent at night seemed particularly forward.</p>
<p class="para">Faile’s next steps would have to be taken with extreme care. Her husband, his people, and his allies were all balanced precariously. Faile found herself wishing she could ask her mother for advice.</p>
<p class="para">That shocked her, and she hesitated, stopping on the worn pathway of trampled yellow grass and mud. <span class="italic1">Light,</span> Faile thought. <span class="italic1">Look what has happened to me.</span></p>
<p class="para">Two years ago, Faile—then called Zarine—had run from her home in Saldaea to become a Hunter for the Horn. She’d rebelled against her duties as the eldest, and the training her mother had insisted she undergo.</p>
<p class="para">She hadn’t run because she’d hated the work; indeed, she’d proven adept at everything required of her. So why had she gone? In part for adventure. But in part—she admitted to herself only now—because of all the assumptions. In Saldaea, you <span class="italic1">always</span> did what was expected of you. Nobody wondered if you would do your duty, particularly if you were a relative of the Queen herself.</p>
<p class="para">And so…she’d left. Not because she’d hated what she would become, but because she had hated the fact that it had seemed so inevitable. Now here she was, using all of the things her mother had insisted she learn.</p>
<p class="para">It was nearly enough to make Faile laugh. She could tell a host of things about the camp from a mere glance. They’d need to find some good leather for the cobblers soon. Water wasn’t a problem, as it had been raining light sprinkles often over the last few days, but dry wood for campfires was an issue. One group of refugees—a collection of former wetlander <span class="italic1">gai’shain</span> who watched Perrin’s Aiel with outright hostility—would need attention. As she walked, she watched to make certain the camp had proper sanitation, and that the soldiers were caring for themselves. Some men would show utmost concern for their horses, then forget to eat anything proper—or at least healthy. Not to mention their habit of spending half the night gossiping by the campfires.</p>
<p class="para">She shook her head and continued walking, entering the supply ring, where food wagons had been unloaded for the horde of cooks and serving maids. The supply ring was almost a village itself, with hundreds of people quickly wearing pathways in the muddy grass. She passed a group of dirty-faced youths digging pits in the ground, then a patch of women chattering and humming as they peeled potatoes, children gathering the rinds and throwing them into the pits. There weren’t many of those children, but Perrin’s force had gathered a number of families from around the countryside who—starving—had begged to join.</p>
<p class="para">Serving men ran baskets of peeled potatoes to cooking pots, which were slowly being filled with water by young women making trips to the stream. Journeyman cooks prepared coals for roasting and older cooks were mixing spices into sauces that could be poured over other foods, which was really the only way to give flavor to such mass quantities.</p>
<p class="para">Elderly women—the few in the camp—shuffled past with bent backs and light wicker baskets bearing herbs clutched on thin arms, their shawls rippling as they chatted with crackling voices. Soldiers hurried in and out, carrying game. Boys between childhood and manhood gathered sticks for tinder; she passed a small gaggle of these who had grown distracted capturing spiders.</p>
<p class="para">It was a tempest of confusion and order coexisting, like two sides of a coin. Strange how well Faile fit in here. Looking back at herself only a few years before, she was amazed to realize that she saw a spoiled, self-centered child. Leaving the Borderlands to become a Hunter for the Horn? She’d abandoned duties, home and family. What had she been thinking?</p>
<p class="para">She passed some women milling grain, then walked around a fresh batch of wild scallions lying on a blanket beside them, waiting to be made into soup. She was glad she’d left and met Perrin, but that didn’t excuse her actions. With a grimace, she remembered forcing Perrin to travel the Ways in the darkness, alone. She didn’t even recall what he’d done to set her off, though she’d never admit that to him.</p>
<p class="para">Her mother had once called her spoiled, and she’d been right. Her mother had also insisted that Faile learn to run the estates, and all the while Faile had dreamed of marrying a Hunter for the Horn and spending her life far away from armies and the boring duties of lords.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Light bless you, Mother,</span> Faile thought. What would she, or Perrin, have done without that training? Without her mother’s teachings, Faile would have been useless. Administration of the entire camp would have rested on Aravine’s shoulders. Capable though the woman was as Perrin’s camp steward, she couldn’t have managed this all on her own. Nor should she have been expected to.</p>
<p class="para">Faile reached the quartermaster’s station, a small pavilion at the very heart of the cooking pits. The breeze brought an amalgamation of scents: fat seared by flames, potatoes boiling, peppered sauces spiced with garlic, the wet, sticky scent of potato peelings being carried to the small herd of hogs they’d managed to bring out of Malden.</p>
<p class="para">The quartermaster, Bavin Rockshaw, was a pale-faced Cairhienin with blond speckled through his graying brown hair, like the fur on a mixed-breed dog. He was spindly through the arms, legs and chest, yet had an almost perfectly round paunch. He had apparently worked at quartermastering as far back as the Aiel War, and was an expert—a master as practiced in overseeing supply operations as a master carpenter was at woodworking.</p>
<p class="para">That, of course, meant that he was an expert at taking bribes. When he saw Faile, he smiled and bowed stiffly enough to be formal, but without ornamentation. “I’m a simple soldier, doing his duty,” that bow said.</p>
<p class="para">“Lady Faile!” he exclaimed, waving over some of his serving men. “Here to inspect the ledgers, I assume?”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, Bavin,” she said, though she knew there would be nothing suspicious in them. He was far too careful.</p>
<p class="para">Still, she made a cursory motion of going through the records. One of the men brought her a stool, another a table upon which to place the ledgers, and yet another a cup of tea. She was impressed at how neatly the columns added up. Her mother had explained that often, a quartermaster would make many messy notations, referencing other pages or other ledgers, separating different types of supplies into different books, all to make it more difficult to track what was going on. A leader who was befuddled by the notations would assume that the quartermaster <span class="italic1">must</span> be doing his job.</p>
<p class="para">There was none of that here. Whatever tricks of numbering Bavin was using to obscure his thievery, they were nothing short of magical. And he <span class="italic1">was</span> stealing, or at least being creative in how he doled out his foodstuffs. That was inevitable. Most quartermasters didn’t really consider it thievery; he was in charge of his supplies, and that was that.</p>
<p class="para">“How odd it is,” Faile said as she leafed through the ledger. “The strange twists of fate.”</p>
<p class="para">“My Lady?” Bavin asked.</p>
<p class="para">“Hmm? Oh, it is nothing. Only that Torven Rikshan’s camp has received their meals each evening a good hour ahead of the other camps. I’m certain that’s just by chance.”</p>
<p class="para">Bavin hesitated. “Undoubtedly, my Lady.”</p>
<p class="para">She continued to leaf through the ledgers. Torven Rikshan was a Cairhienin lord, and had been placed in charge of one of the twenty camps within the larger mass of refugees. He had an usually large number of nobles in his particular camp. Aravine had brought this to Faile’s attention; she wasn’t certain what Torven had given to receive supplies for meals more quickly, but it wouldn’t do. The other camps might feel that Perrin was favoring one over another.</p>
<p class="para">“Yes,” Faile said, laughing lightly. “Merely coincidence. These things happen in a camp so large. Why, just the other day Varkel Tius was complaining to me that he had put in a requisition for canvas to repair torn tents, but hasn’t had his canvas for nearly a week now. Yet I know for a fact that Soffi Moraton ripped her tent during the stream crossing but had it repaired by that evening.”</p>
<p class="para">Bavin was silent.</p>
<p class="para">Faile made no accusations. Her mother had cautioned that a good quartermaster was too valuable to toss into prison, particularly when the next man was likely to be half as capable and equally corrupt. Faile’s duty was not to expose or embarrass Bavin. It was to make him worried enough that he kept himself in check.</p>
<p class="para">“Perhaps you can do something about these irregularities, Bavin,” she said, closing the ledger. “I loathe to burden you with silly matters, but the problems must not reach my husband’s ears. You know how he is when enraged.”</p>
<p class="para">Actually, Perrin was about as likely to hurt a man like Bavin as Faile was to flap her arms and fly away. But the camp didn’t see it that way. They heard reports of Perrin’s fury in battle, along with her occasional arguments with him—provoked by Faile so that they could have a proper discussion—and assumed he had a terrible temper. That was good, so long as they also thought of him as honorable and kind. Protective of his people, yet filled with rage at those who crossed him.</p>
<p class="para">She rose from the stool, handing the ledgers to one of the men, curly-haired and with ink stains on his fingers and jerkin. She smiled at Bavin, then made her way out of the supply ring. She noted with displeasure that the bunch of wild scallions beside the pathway had spoiled in the moments since she’d seen them last, their stalks melted and runny, as if they’d been rotting in the sun for weeks. These spoilings had begun only recently inside of camp, but by reports, it happened far more frequently out in the countryside.</p>
<p class="para">It was hard to tell the hour with the sky so full of clouds, but it seemed from the darkening horizon that her time to meet with Perrin had come. Faile smiled. Her mother had warned her what would happen to her, had told her what was expected of her, and Faile had worried that she would feel trapped by life.</p>
<p class="para">But what Deira <span class="italic1">hadn’t</span> mentioned was how fulfilling it would be. Perrin made the difference. It was no trap at all to be caught with him.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Perrin stood with one foot up on the stump of a felled tree, facing north. The hilltop let him look out over the plains toward the cliffs of Garen’s Wall rising like the knuckles of a slumbering giant.</p>
<p class="para">He opened his mind, questing out for wolves. There were some in the distance, almost too faint to feel. Wolves stayed away from large gatherings of men.</p>
<p class="para">The camp spread out behind him, watchfires fluttering at its boundaries. This hillside was far enough away to be secluded, but not so distant as to be solitary. He wasn’t certain why Faile had asked him to meet her here at dusk, but she’d smelled excited, so he hadn’t pried. Women liked their secrets.</p>
<p class="para">He heard Faile coming up the side of the hill, stepping softly on the wet grass. She was good at being quiet—not nearly as good as Elyas or one of the Aiel, but better than one might think of her. But he could smell her scent, soap with lavender. She used that particular soap only on days she deemed special.</p>
<p class="para">She stepped atop the hillside, beautiful, impressive. She wore a violet vest over a long silk blouse of a lighter shade. Where had she gotten the clothing? He hadn’t seen her in this fine outfit before.</p>
<p class="para">“My husband,” she said, stepping up to him. He could faintly hear others near the foot of the hill—probably <span class="italic1">Cha Faile</span>. She’d left them behind. “You look concerned.”</p>
<p class="para">“It’s my fault that Gill and the others were captured, Faile,” he said. “My failures continue to mount. It’s a wonder anyone follows me.”</p>
<p class="para">“Perrin,” she said, laying a hand on his arm. “We’ve spoken of this. You mustn’t say such things.”</p>
<p class="para">“Why?”</p>
<p class="para">“Because I’ve never known you to be a liar,” she said with a softly chiding tone.</p>
<p class="para">He looked at her. It was growing dark, though he could still make out details. She’d have a harder time seeing them.</p>
<p class="para">“Why do you continue to fight this?” she asked. “You <span class="italic1">are</span> a good leader, Perrin.”</p>
<p class="para">“I wouldn’t have given myself up for them,” he said.</p>
<p class="para">She frowned. “What does that have to—”</p>
<p class="para">“Back in the Two Rivers,” Perrin said, turning away from her, looking north again, “I was ready to do it. When the Whitecloaks had Mat’s family and the Luhhans, I’d have given myself up. This time, I wouldn’t have. Even when I spoke to their leader, asking his price, I knew I wouldn’t give myself up.”</p>
<p class="para">“You’re becoming a better leader.”</p>
<p class="para">“How can you say that? I’m growing callous, Faile. If you knew the things I did to get you back, the things I would have done…” He fingered the hammer at his side. <span class="italic1">The tooth or the claw, Young Bull, it matters not.</span> He’d thrown away the axe, but could he blame it for his brutality? It was only a tool. He could use the hammer to do the same terrible things.</p>
<p class="para">“It’s not callous,” Faile said, “or selfish. You’re a lord now, and you can’t let it be known that capturing your subjects will undermine your rule. Do you think Queen Morgase would abdicate to tyrants who kidnapped her subjects? No leader could rule that way. Your inability to stop evil men does not make you evil yourself.”</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t want this mantle, Faile. I never have.”</p>
<p class="para">“I know.”</p>
<p class="para">“Sometimes I wish I’d never left the Two Rivers. I wish I’d let Rand run off to his destiny, leaving regular folk behind to live their lives.”</p>
<p class="para">He caught a scent of annoyance from her.</p>
<p class="para">“But if I’d stayed,” he added hastily, “I’d never have met you. So I’m glad I left. I’m just saying I’ll be glad when this is all through and finished, and I can go back to someplace simple.”</p>
<p class="para">“You think the Two Rivers will ever go back to being the way you remember it?”</p>
<p class="para">He hesitated. She was right—when they’d gone, it had already been showing signs of change. Refugees from across the mountains moving in, the villages swelling. Now, with so many men joining him in war, getting ideas into their heads about having a lord…</p>
<p class="para">“I could find someplace else,” he said, feeling stubborn. “There are other villages. They won’t all change.”</p>
<p class="para">“And you’d drag me off to one of these villages, Perrin Aybara?” she said.</p>
<p class="para">“I…” What would happen if Faile, his beautiful Faile, were confined to a sleepy village? He always insisted that he was only a blacksmith. But was Faile a blacksmith’s wife? “I would never force you to do anything, Faile,” he said, cupping her face in his hand. He always felt awkward when touching her satin cheeks with his thick, callused fingers.</p>
<p class="para">“I’d go, if you really wanted me to,” she replied. That was odd. He’d normally expect a snap from her at his awkward tongue. “But is it what you want? Is it really?”</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t know what I want,” he said frankly. No, he didn’t want to drag Faile off to a village. “Maybe…life as a blacksmith in a city, somewhere?”</p>
<p class="para">“If you wish it,” she repeated. “Of course, that would leave the Two Rivers without a lord. They’d have to find someone else.”</p>
<p class="para">“No. They don’t <span class="italic1">need</span> a lord. That’s why I have to stop them treating me like one.”</p>
<p class="para">“And you think they’d give up on the idea that quickly?” Faile asked, smelling amused. “After they’ve seen how everyone else does it? After the way they fawned over that fool Luc? After welcoming in all of those people from Almoth Plain, who are used to lords?”</p>
<p class="para">What <span class="italic1">would</span> the Two Rivers folk do if he stepped down as their lord? In a sinking moment of realization, he knew that Faile was right. <span class="italic1">Surely they’d pick someone who’d do a better job of it than me,</span> he thought. <span class="italic1">Maybe Master al’Vere.</span></p>
<p class="para">But could Perrin trust that? Men like Master al’Vere or Tam might turn down the position. Might they end up picking someone like old Cenn Buie? Would they have a choice? If Perrin stepped aside, might some person who figured himself highborn <span class="italic1">seize</span> power?</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Don’t be a fool, Perrin Aybara,</span> he thought. <span class="italic1">Almost anyone would be better than you.</span></p>
<p class="para">Still, the thought of someone else taking control—someone else being lord—filled him with intense anxiety. And a surprising amount of sadness.</p>
<p class="para">“Now,” Faile said, “stop your brooding. I have grand intentions for this evening.” She clapped her hands loudly three times, and movements began below. Soon, servants crested the hillside. Perrin recognized them as people she’d appropriated from among the refugees, a group as loyal to her as <span class="italic1">Cha Faile</span>.</p>
<p class="para">They carried canvas, which they spread on the ground. Then they covered that with a blanket. And what was that he smelled coming up from below? Ham?</p>
<p class="para">“What <span class="italic1">is</span> this, Faile?” he asked.</p>
<p class="para">“At first,” she said, “I assumed that you had something special planned for our <span class="italic1">shanna’har</span>. I grew nervous when you didn’t mention it, however, and so I asked. It appears that you do not celebrate it in the Two Rivers, odd though that is.”</p>
<p class="para">“<span class="italic1">Shanna’har</span>?” Perrin asked, scratching his head.</p>
<p class="para">“In the coming weeks,” Faile said, “we will have been married one year. This is our first <span class="italic1">shanna’har</span>, our marriage celebration.” She folded her arms, watching as her servants arranged a meal on the blanket. “In Saldaea, we celebrate the <span class="italic1">shanna’har</span> each year in the early summer. It is a festival to mark another year together, another year with neither husband nor wife fallen to the Trollocs. Young couples are told to savor their first <span class="italic1">shanna’har</span>, much as one savors the first taste of a succulent meal. Our marriage will only be new to us once.”</p>
<p class="para">The servants laid out a meal, including several glass bowls with candles in them. Faile dismissed the servants with a smile and a wave, and they retreated down the side of the hill. Faile had obviously taken care to make the meal look lavish. The blanket was embroidered, perhaps taken from Shaido spoils. The meal was served on silver plates and platters, ham over a bed of boiled barley and capers across the top. There was even wine.</p>
<p class="para">Faile stepped closer to him. “I realize that there has been much, this year, that is not worth savoring. Malden, the Prophet, that harsh winter. But if these things are the cost for being with you, Perrin, then I would pay them freely a dozen times over.</p>
<p class="para">“If all were well, we would spend this next month giving gifts to one another, affirming our love, celebrating our first summer as husband and wife. I doubt we will have the month of ease that is our right, but at least we should spend and enjoy this evening together.”</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t know if I can, Faile,” he said. “The Whitecloaks, the sky…Light! The Last Battle itself is almost here. The <span class="italic1">Last Battle</span>, Faile! How can I feast while my people are being held under threat of execution and while the world itself may die?”</p>
<p class="para">“If the world itself is going to die,” Faile said, “is this not the time when a man <span class="italic1">must</span> take time to appreciate what he has? Before it is all taken?”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin hesitated. She laid a hand on his arm, her touch so soft. She hadn’t raised her voice. Did she want him to yell? It was so hard to tell when she wanted an argument and when she didn’t. Maybe Elyas would have advice for him.</p>
<p class="para">“Please,” she said softly. “Try to relax for one evening. For me.”</p>
<p class="para">“All right,” he said, laying his hand on hers.</p>
<p class="para">She led him to the blanket and they settled down, side by side before the array of silver dishes. Faile lit more candles off of the lit ones the servants had left. The night was chilly—the clouds seemed to draw summer warmth away. “Why do this outside?” Perrin said. “And not in our tent?”</p>
<p class="para">“I asked Tam what you do in the Two Rivers for <span class="italic1">shanna’har</span>,” she said. “And as I feared, I learned that you don’t celebrate it. That is really quite backward, you realize—we’ll need to change the custom, once things settle down. Regardless, Tam said that the closest they had was something he and his wife did. Once a year, they would pack up a full meal—as extravagant as they could afford—and hike to a new place in the woods. They would dine there and spend the day with one another.” She snuggled up against him. “Our wedding was done in the Two Rivers fashion, so I wished this day to be after that fashion as well.”</p>
<p class="para">He smiled. Despite his earlier objections his tension was easing. The food smelled good, and his stomach growled, prompting Faile to sit up and take his plate and hand it to him.</p>
<p class="para">He dug in. He tried to keep his manners, but the food was excellent, and it had been a long day. He found himself ripping into the ham with ferocity, though he tried to take care not to drip on the fancy blanket.</p>
<p class="para">Faile ate more slowly, the scent of amusement mixing with that of her soap.</p>
<p class="para">“What?” Perrin asked, wiping his mouth. She was lit only by the candles, now that the sun was fully down.</p>
<p class="para">“There’s much of the wolf in you, my husband.”</p>
<p class="para">He froze, noticing that he’d been licking his fingers. He growled at himself, wiping them instead on a napkin. As much as he liked wolves, he wouldn’t invite them to the dinner table with him. “Too much of the wolf in me,” he said.</p>
<p class="para">“You are what you are, my husband. And I happen to love what you are, so that is well.”</p>
<p class="para">He continued to chew on his cut of the ham. The night was quiet, the servants having retreated far enough away that he couldn’t smell or hear them. Likely Faile had left orders that they weren’t to be disturbed, and with the trees at the base of the hillside, they wouldn’t have to worry about being observed.</p>
<p class="para">“Faile,” he said softy, “you need to know what I did while you were captive. I did things I worried would turn me into someone you would no longer want. It wasn’t only the deal with the Seanchan. There were people in a city, So Habor, that I can’t stop thinking of. People that maybe I should have helped. And there was a Shaido, with his hand—”</p>
<p class="para">“I heard about that. It seems that you did what you had to.”</p>
<p class="para">“I’d have gone much farther,” Perrin admitted. “Hating myself all the way. You spoke of a lord being strong enough to resist letting himself be manipulated. Well, I’ll never be that strong. Not if you’re taken.”</p>
<p class="para">“We shall have to make certain I don’t get taken.”</p>
<p class="para">“It could ruin me, Faile,” he said softly. “Anything else, I think I could handle. But if you are used against me, nothing will matter. I’d do anything to protect you, Faile. <span class="italic1">Anything.</span>”</p>
<p class="para">“Perhaps you should wrap me up in soft cloth, then,” she said dryly, “and tuck me away in a locked room.” Oddly, her scent was not offended.</p>
<p class="para">“I wouldn’t do that,” Perrin said. “You know I wouldn’t. But this means I have a weakness, a terrible one. The type a leader can’t have.”</p>
<p class="para">She snorted. “You think other leaders don’t have weaknesses, Perrin? Every King or Queen of Saldaea has had their own. Nikiol Dianatkhah was a drunkard, despite being known as one of our greatest kings, and Belairah married and put her husband away four times. Her heart always did lead her to trouble. Jonasim had a son whose gambling ways nearly brought her House to ruin, and Lyonford couldn’t keep his temper if challenged. Each and every one was a great monarch. And all had their share of weaknesses.”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin continued to chew on his food, thoughtful.</p>
<p class="para">“In the Borderlands,” Faile said, “we have a saying. ‘A polished sword reflects the truth.’ A man can <span class="italic1">claim</span> to be diligent in his duties, but if his sword isn’t polished, you know that he’s been idle.</p>
<p class="para">“Well, your sword is bright, my husband. These last few weeks, you keep <span class="italic1">saying</span> that you led poorly during my captivity. You’d have me believe that you led the entire camp to ruin and dust! But that’s not true at all. You kept them focused; you inspired them, maintained a strong presence, and kept the air of a lord.”</p>
<p class="para">“Berelain’s behind some of that,” he said. “I half think the woman would have bathed me herself if I’d gone another day without.”</p>
<p class="para">“I’m certain that wouldn’t have been good for the rumors,” Faile noted dryly.</p>
<p class="para">“Faile, I—”</p>
<p class="para">“I’ll deal with Berelain,” Faile said. Her voice sounded dangerous. “That’s one duty you needn’t distract yourself with.”</p>
<p class="para">“But—”</p>
<p class="para">“I’ll <span class="italic1">deal</span> with her,” Faile said, her voice more firm. It was not wise to challenge her when she smelled that way, not unless he wanted to start a full argument. She softened, taking another bite of barley. “When I said you were like a wolf, my husband, I wasn’t talking about the way you eat. I was talking about the way you give your attention. You are driven. Given a problem to solve, no matter how grand, and you will see it done.</p>
<p class="para">“Can’t you understand? That’s a wonderful trait in a leader. It is exactly what the Two Rivers will need. Assuming, of course, that you have a wife to care for some of the smaller issues.” She frowned. “I wish you’d spoken to me about the banner before burning it. It will be difficult to raise it again without looking foolish.”</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t want to raise it again,” Perrin said. “That’s why I had them burn it.”</p>
<p class="para">“But <span class="italic1">why</span>?”</p>
<p class="para">He took another bite of his ham, pointedly not watching her. She smelled curious, almost desperately so.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">I</span> can’t <span class="italic1">lead them,</span> he thought. <span class="italic1">Not until I know if I can master the wolf.</span> How could he explain? Explain that he feared the way it took control when he fought, when he wanted something too badly?</p>
<p class="para">He would not rid himself of the wolves; they had become too much a part of him. But where would he leave his people, where would he leave Faile, if he lost himself to what was inside of him?</p>
<p class="para">He again remembered a dirty creature, once a man, locked in a cage. <span class="italic1">There is nothing left in this one that remembers being a man…</span></p>
<p class="para">“My husband,” Faile said, resting a hand on his arm. “Please.” She smelled of pain. That twisted his heart about.</p>
<p class="para">“It has to do with those Whitecloaks,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para">“What? Perrin, I thought I said—”</p>
<p class="para">“It has to do,” Perrin said firmly, “with what happened to me the first time I met with them. And what I’d begun to discover in the days before.”</p>
<p class="para">Faile frowned.</p>
<p class="para">“I’ve told you that I killed two Whitecloaks,” he said. “Before I met you.”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="para">“Settle back,” he said. “You need to know the whole story.”</p>
<p class="para">And so he told her. Hesitantly at first, but the words soon grew easier. He spoke of Shadar Logoth, and of their group being scattered. Of Egwene letting him take the lead, perhaps the first time he’d been forced to do that.</p>
<p class="para">He’d already told her of his meeting with Elyas. She knew much about Perrin, things that he’d never told anyone else, things he’d never even spoken of with Elyas. She knew about the wolf. She knew that he feared he’d lose himself.</p>
<p class="para">But she didn’t know what he felt in battle. She didn’t know what it had felt like to kill those Whitecloaks, to taste their blood—either in his own mouth, or through his link with the wolves. She didn’t know what it had been like to be consumed by anger, fear and desperation when she’d been taken. These were the things he haltingly explained.</p>
<p class="para">He told her of the frenzy he’d gone into when searching for her in the wolf dream. He spoke of Noam and what he feared would happen to him. And of how it related to how he acted when he fought.</p>
<p class="para">Faile listened, sitting quietly atop the hilltop, arms wrapped around her legs, lit by candlelight. Her scents were subdued. Perhaps he should have held some things back. No woman wanted to know what a beast her husband became when he killed, did she? But now that he was speaking, he wanted to be rid of his secrets. He was tired of them.</p>
<p class="para">Each word spoken made him relax more. It did what the meal—touching though it had been—hadn’t been able to. In telling her of his struggles, he felt some of his burden lift.</p>
<p class="para">He finished by speaking of Hopper. He wasn’t certain why he’d saved the wolf for last; Hopper was part of much Perrin had told before—the Whitecloaks, the wolf dream. But it felt right to reserve Hopper until the end, so he did.</p>
<p class="para">As he finished, he stared at the flame of one of the candles. Two of them had gone out, leaving others still to flicker. That wasn’t dim light to his eyes. He had trouble remembering what the days had been like when his senses had been as weak as an ordinary man’s.</p>
<p class="para">Faile leaned against him, wrapping his arm around her. “Thank you,” she said.</p>
<p class="para">He let out a deep sigh, leaning back against the stump behind him, feeling her warmth.</p>
<p class="para">“I want to tell you about Malden,” she said.</p>
<p class="para">“You don’t have to,” he said. “Just because I—”</p>
<p class="para">“Hush. I was quiet while you spoke. It’s my turn.”</p>
<p class="para">“All right.”</p>
<p class="para">It should have been worrying for him to hear about Malden. He lay with his back to the stump, sky crackling with energy above, the Pattern itself in danger of unraveling, while his wife spoke of being captured and beaten. Yet it was one of the most oddly relaxing things he’d ever experienced.</p>
<p class="para">The events in that city had been important to her, maybe even good for her. Though he was angered at hearing how Sevanna had trussed Faile up naked and left her overnight. Someday he’d hunt that woman down.</p>
<p class="para">Not today, however. Today he had his wife in his arms, and her strong voice was a comfort. He should have realized she would have planned her own escape. In fact, listening to her careful preparation, he began to feel a fool. She’d been worried that he’d get himself killed trying to rescue her—she didn’t say it, but he could infer it. How well she knew him.</p>
<p class="para">Faile left some things out. He didn’t mind. Faile would be like a penned and caged animal without her secrets. He got a good hint of what she was hiding, though. It was something to do with that Brotherless who had captured her, something about Faile’s plans to trick the man and his friends into helping her escape. Perhaps she’d felt a fondness for him, and didn’t wish Perrin to regret killing him. That wasn’t necessary. Those Brotherless had been with the Shaido, and they had attacked and killed men under Perrin’s protection. No act of kindness would redeem that. They deserved their deaths.</p>
<p class="para">That gave him pause. The Whitecloaks probably said very similar things about him. But the Whitecloaks had attacked first.</p>
<p class="para">She finished. It was very late, now, and Perrin reached over to a bundle that Faile’s servants had brought up, pulling out a blanket.</p>
<p class="para">“Well?” Faile asked as he settled back, putting his arm around her again.</p>
<p class="para">“I’m surprised that you didn’t give me an earful for barreling in like a wild bull and stomping all over your plans.”</p>
<p class="para">That made her smell satisfied. It wasn’t the emotion he’d expected, but he’d long ago stopped trying to decipher the ways of women’s thought.</p>
<p class="para">“I almost brought the matter up tonight,” Faile said, “so that we could have a proper argument and a proper reconciliation.”</p>
<p class="para">“Why didn’t you?”</p>
<p class="para">“I decided that this night should be done in the Two Rivers way.”</p>
<p class="para">“And you think husbands and wives don’t argue in the Two Rivers?” he asked, amused.</p>
<p class="para">“Well, perhaps they do. But you, husband, always seem uncomfortable when we yell. I’m very glad you’ve begun to stand up for yourself, as is proper. But I have asked much from you to adapt to my ways. I thought, tonight, I would try to adapt to yours.”</p>
<p class="para">Those were words that he had never expected to hear from Faile. It seemed the most personal thing she could ever have given him. Embarrassingly, he felt tears in his eyes, and he pulled her tight.</p>
<p class="para">“Now,” she said, “I’m not a docile sheep, mind you.”</p>
<p class="para">“I would <span class="italic1">never</span> think that,” he said. “Never.”</p>
<p class="para">She smelled satisfied.</p>
<p class="para">“I’m sorry I didn’t give much thought to you escaping on your own,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para">“I forgive you.”</p>
<p class="para">He looked down at her, those beautiful dark eyes reflecting the candlelight. “Does this mean we can have the reconciliation without the argument?”</p>
<p class="para">She smiled. “I will allow it, this once. And, of course, the servants have strict orders to ensure our solitude.”</p>
<p class="para">He kissed her. It felt so very right, and he knew that the worries he’d had—and the awkwardness that had been between them since Malden—were gone. Whether it had been something real or something he imagined, it had passed.</p>
<p class="para">He had Faile back, truly and completely.</p>
