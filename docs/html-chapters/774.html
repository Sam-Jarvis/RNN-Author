<p class="tni">Siuan let out a long, relieved breath as the Amyrlin—with eyes as if on fire—strode through the gateway and into their camp with Doesine, Saerin and several other Sitters.</p>
<p class="tx">Bryne came through the gateway after them, hurrying up to Siuan. “What was decided?” she asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“We stand, for now,” Bryne said. “Elayne’s orders, and the Amyrlin agrees with them.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We’re outnumbered,” Siuan said.</p>
<p class="tx">“And so is everyone else,” he said, looking westward.</p>
<p class="tx">The Sharans had spent the last few days gathering their forces, setting up a mile or two away from Egwene’s army, which was stationed with its back to the wide river that formed the border between Kandor and Arafel.</p>
<p class="tx">The Shadow hadn’t committed to an all-out attack yet, instead sending an occasional raiding group through gateways as they waited for the slower Trolloc army to catch up. The Trollocs were here now, unfortunately. Egwene’s force could have retreated again through gateways, but Siuan admitted to herself that would accomplish little. They had to face this force eventually.</p>
<p class="tx">Bryne had selected this place at the southeastern tip of Kandor because the terrain gave them an advantage, albeit a small one. The river that ran north-south on the eastern border of Kandor was deep, but a ford lay less than a quarter-mile away from the hills that ran east to west along the southern border of Kandor. The Shadow’s army would be making for the ford to enter Arafel. By stationing his forces at the ford and on the hills overlooking it, Bryne could engage the invading army from two directions. If pressed, he could withdraw across the ford to the Arafellin side, the water barrier putting the Trollocs at a disadvantage against them. It was a small benefit, but in battle, sometimes the small things made all the difference.</p>
<p class="tx">On the plains west of the river, the Shadow formed up the Sharan and Trolloc armies. Both moved across the field toward the beleaguered Aes Sedai and troops under Bryne’s command.</p>
<p class="tx">Nearby, Egwene surveyed the camp. Light, it was a relief to know that the Amyrlin had survived. Siuan had predicted it, but still … Light. It was good to see Egwene’s face.</p>
<p class="tx">If, indeed, it was her face. This was the first time that the Amyrlin had returned to camp following her ordeal, but she had spent several quiet meetings with the Sitters in secret locations. Siuan had not yet had a chance to speak with Egwene in quiet.</p>
<p class="tx">“Egwene al’Vere,” Siuan called after the Amyrlin. “Tell me where we first met!”</p>
<p class="tx">The others looked at Siuan, frowning at her temerity. Egwene, however, seemed to understand. “Fal Dara,” she said. “You bound me with Air on our trip down the river from there, as part of a lesson in the Power I have never forgotten.”</p>
<p class="tx">Siuan breathed a second, deeper sigh of relief. Nobody had been in that lesson on the ship but Egwene and Nynaeve. But Siuan had unfortunately told Sheriam, Mistress of Novices and Black Ajah, about it. Well, she still believed that this was in fact Egwene. Imitating a woman’s features was easy, but prying out her memories was another story.</p>
<p class="tx">Siuan made certain to look into the woman’s eyes. There had been talk, of what had happened at the Black Tower. Myrelle had spoken of it, of events shared by her new Warders. Something dark.</p>
<p class="tx">They said you could tell. Siuan would see the change in Egwene if it had happened to her, wouldn’t she?</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">If we can’t tell,</span> Siuan thought, <span class="epub-i1">then we’re already doomed.</span> She would have to trust the Amyrlin as she had so many times before.</p>
<p class="tx">“Gather the Aes Sedai,” Egwene said. “Commander Bryne, you have your orders. We hold at this river unless the losses become so absolutely unbearable that…” She trailed off. “How long have <span class="epub-i1">those</span> been there?”</p>
<p class="tx">Siuan looked up at the <span class="epub-i1">raken</span> scouts passing overhead. “All morning. You have his letter.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Bloody man,” Egwene said. The Dragon Reborn’s message, delivered by Min Farshaw, had been brief.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">The Seanchan fight the Shadow.</span></p>
<p class="tx">He’d sent Min to them, for reasons the woman wouldn’t quite state. Bryne had given her tasks immediately: She was working for the supply masters as a clerk.</p>
<p class="tx">“Do you trust the Dragon Reborn’s word regarding the Seanchan, Mother?” Saerin asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t know,” Egwene said. “Form up our battle lines anyway, but keep an eye on those things up there, in case they attack.”</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">As Rand entered the cavern, something changed in the air. The Dark One only now sensed his arrival, and was surprised by it. The dagger had done its job.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand led the way, Nynaeve at his left, Moiraine at his right. The cavern led downward, and climbing down it lost them all of the elevation they’d gained. The passage was familiar to him, from another’s memory, from another Age.</p>
<p class="tx">It was as if the cavern were swallowing them, forcing them down toward the fires below. The cavern’s ceiling, jagged with fanglike stalactites, seemed to lower as they walked. Inching down with each step. It didn’t move, and the cavern didn’t gradually narrow. It just <span class="epub-i1">changed</span>, tall one moment, shorter the next.</p>
<p class="tx">The cavern was a set of jaws, slowly tightening on its prey. Rand’s head brushed the tip of a stalactite, and Nynaeve crouched down, looking upward and cursing softly.</p>
<p class="tx">“No,” Rand said, stopping. “I will not come to you on my knees, Shai’tan.”</p>
<p class="tx">The cavern rumbled. The cavern’s dark reaches seemed to press inward, pushing against Rand. He stood motionless. It was as if he were a stuck gear, and the rest of the machine strained to keep turning the hands on the clock. He held firm.</p>
<p class="tx">The rocks trembled, then retreated. Rand stepped forward, and released a breath as the pressure lessened. This thing he had begun could not be stopped now. Slowing strained both him and the Dark One; his adversary was caught up in this inevitability as much as he was. The Dark One didn’t exist within the Pattern, but the Pattern still affected him.</p>
<p class="tx">Behind Rand, where he had stopped, lay a small pool of blood.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">I will need to be quick about this,</span> he thought. <span class="epub-i1">I can’t bleed to death until the battle is finished.</span></p>
<p class="tx">The ground trembled again.</p>
<p class="tx">“That’s right,” Rand whispered. “I’m coming for you. I am not a sheep being led to the slaughter, Shai’tan. Today, I am the hunter.”</p>
<p class="tx">The trembling of the ground seemed almost like laughter. Horrible laughter. Rand ignored Moiraine’s worried look as she walked beside him.</p>
<p class="tx">Down they went. An odd sensation came to mind. One of the women was in trouble. Was it Elayne? Aviendha? He could not tell. The warping of this place affected the bond. He was moving through time differently than they, and he lost his sense of where they were. He could only feel that one was in pain.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand growled, walking faster. If the Dark One had hurt them … Shouldn’t it be growing lighter in here? They had to rely on the glow of <span class="epub-i1">Callandor</span> as he pulled <span class="epub-i1">saidin</span> through it. “Where are the fires?” Rand asked, voice echoing. “The molten stone at the bottom of the path?”</p>
<p class="tx">“The fires have been consumed, Lews Therin,” a voice said from the shadows ahead.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand stopped, then stepped forward, <span class="epub-i1">Callandor</span> thrust out to illuminate a figure on one knee at the edge of the light, head bowed, sword held before him, tip resting against the ground.</p>
<p class="tx">Beyond the figure was … nothing. A blackness.</p>
<p class="tx">“Rand,” Moiraine said, hand on his arm. “The Dark One wells up against his bonds. Do not touch that blackness.”</p>
<p class="tx">The figure stood and turned, Moridin’s now-familiar face reflecting <span class="epub-i1">Callandor</span>’s glow. Beside him on the ground lay a husk. Rand could explain it no other way. It was like the shell some insects leave behind when they grow, only it was in the shape of a man. A man with no eyes. One of the Myrddraal?</p>
<p class="tx">Moridin looked to the husk, following Rand’s gaze. “A vessel my master needed no longer,” Moridin said. <span class="epub-i1">Saa</span> floated in the whites of his eyes, bouncing, shaking, moving with crazed vigor. “It gave birth to what is behind me.”</p>
<p class="tx">“There is nothing behind you.”</p>
<p class="tx">Moridin raised his sword before his face in a salute. “Exactly.” Those eyes were nearly completely black.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand waved for Moiraine and Nynaeve to stay a few steps back as he approached. “You demand a duel? Here? Now? Elan, you know what I do is inevitable. Slowing me has no purpose.”</p>
<p class="tx">“No purpose, Lews Therin?” Moridin laughed. “If I weaken you even slightly, will my master’s task not be that much easier? No, I think I shall <span class="epub-i1">indeed</span> stand in your way. And if I win, what then? Your victory is not assured. It never has been.”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">I win again, Lews Therin</span> … </p>
<p class="tx">“You could step aside,” Rand said, raising <span class="epub-i1">Callandor</span>, the glow of its light shifting off Moridin’s black steel sword. “If my victory is not assured, neither is your fall. Let me pass. For once, make the choice you know you should.”</p>
<p class="tx">Moridin laughed. “Now? <span class="epub-i1">Now</span> you beg me to return to the Light? I have been promised oblivion. Finally, nothing, a destruction of my entire being. An <span class="epub-i1">end</span>. You will not steal that from me, Lews Therin! By my grave, you will not!”</p>
<p class="tx">Moridin came forward swinging.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Lan executed Cherry Petal Kisses the Pond—not an easy task from horseback, as it was not a form designed for the saddle. His sword slashed into the neck of a Trolloc, just an inch into the creature’s skin. That was enough to make fetid blood blossom in a spray. The bull-faced creature dropped its catchpole, reaching up to hold its neck, and let out a gurgling half-scream, half-groan.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan danced Mandarb backward as a second Trolloc came for his side. He cut its arm off as he spun. The Trolloc stumbled from the blow, and Andere ran it through from behind.</p>
<p class="tx">Andere moved his horse up beside Mandarb; over the din of battle, Lan could hear his friend panting. How long had they been fighting here at the battle’s front? Lan’s arms felt like lead on his shoulders.</p>
<p class="tx">It hadn’t been this bad during the Blood Snow.</p>
<p class="tx">“Lan!” Andere shouted. “They keep coming!”</p>
<p class="tx">Lan nodded, then moved Mandarb back again as a pair of Trollocs shoved their way through corpses to attack. These two had catchpoles as well. That wasn’t uncommon for Trollocs; they realized that men on foot were far less dangerous to them than men on horseback. Still, it made Lan wonder if they were trying to capture him.</p>
<p class="tx">He and Andere let the Trollocs come through and attack, as two members of the High Guard rode in from the side to distract their attention. The Trollocs came for Lan, and he lurched forward, swinging and cutting in half the shaft of each of their catchpoles.</p>
<p class="tx">The beasts didn’t stop, reaching brutish fingers to try to pull him down. Lan could smell their putrid breath as he rammed his sword into the throat of one. How slowly his muscles moved! Andere had better be in position.</p>
<p class="tx">Andere’s horse came in with a sudden gallop, slamming its armored flank into the second Trolloc, knocking it to the side. It stumbled, and the two mounted guardsmen butchered it with long-handled axes.</p>
<p class="tx">Those men were both bloodied, as was Andere. As was Lan himself. He only vaguely remembered taking that thigh wound. He was growing <span class="epub-i1">so</span> tired. He wasn’t in any condition to fight.</p>
<p class="tx">“We pull back,” he announced reluctantly. “Let someone else take the point for now.” Lan and his men were leading the heavy cavalry at the tip of the fight, pressing against the Trollocs in a triangular formation to shear through and pushing them to the sides for the flanking attacks to crush.</p>
<p class="tx">The others nodded, and he could sense their relief as he pulled himself and his fifty-something High Guards back. They retreated, and a group of Shienarans moved in to fill the point. Lan cleaned his sword, then sheathed it. Lightning rumbled above. Yes, those clouds <span class="epub-i1">did</span> seem lower today. Like a hand, slowly pressing down upon the men as they died.</p>
<p class="tx">Lightning bolts cracked the air nearby, one after another. Lan turned Mandarb sharply. There had been a lot of lightning today, but those had been too close together. He smelled smoke on the air.</p>
<p class="tx">“Dreadlords?” Andere asked.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan nodded, eyes searching for the attackers. All he could see was the lines of men fighting, the swarming mass of Trollocs driving forward in waves. He needed higher ground.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan gestured at one of the hills, and heeled Mandarb toward it. Members of the rear guard watched him pass, giving a raised hand and a “Dai Shan.” Their armor was stained with blood. The reserves had been rotated to the front, then back again, during the day.</p>
<p class="tx">Mandarb plodded up the hill. Lan patted the horse, then dismounted and trudged beside the stallion. At the top, he stopped to survey the battle. Borderlander armies made spikelike indentations of silver and color in the Trolloc sea.</p>
<p class="tx">So <span class="epub-i1">many</span>. The Dreadlords had come out on their large platform again, the mechanism pulled by dozens of Trollocs as it rolled across the field. They needed height to see where to direct their attacks. Lan set his jaw, watching a series of lightning bolts strike the Kandori, hurling bodies into the air and opening a gap in their lines.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan’s own channelers struck back, hurling lightning and fire at the advancing Trollocs to keep them from pouring through the hole in the Borderlander line. That would work for only so long. He had far fewer Aes Sedai and Asha’man than the Shadow had Dreadlords.</p>
<p class="tx">“Light,” said Prince Kaisel, riding up next to him. “Dai Shan, if they rip enough holes in our lines…”</p>
<p class="tx">“Reserves are coming. There,” Andere said, pointing. He was still mounted, and Lan had to step forward to look around him to see what he was indicating. A group of Shienaran riders were making for the lines upon which the lightning bolts were falling.</p>
<p class="tx">“There too,” Kaisel said, pointing to the east. A group of Arafellin were making for the same place. The two forces became entangled as they both rushed to close the gap at the same time.</p>
<p class="tx">Lightning began to strike down from the sky, raining on the Dreadlords’ platform. Good. Narishma and Merise had been told to watch for the Dreadlords and try to kill them. Perhaps it would distract the enemy. Lan focused on something else.</p>
<p class="tx">Why had two groups of reserves been sent to plug that same hole? Either unit would have been large enough for the job; with so many, they had interfered with one another. A mistake?</p>
<p class="tx">He climbed into Mandarb’s saddle, reluctant to make the horse work again so soon. He would check on this error.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Within the wolf dream, Perrin and Gaul stopped on a ridge overlooking a valley with a mountain at the end of it. Above the mountain, the black clouds spun in a terrible vortex that didn’t quite touch the mountain’s tip.</p>
<p class="tx">The winds ravaged the valley, and Perrin was forced to create a pocket of stillness around himself and Gaul, deflecting debris. Down below, they caught quick fragments of an enormous battle. Aiel, Trollocs and men in armor appeared in the wolf dream for moments as if out of twisting smoke and dust, swung weapons, disintegrated in midblow. Thousands of them.</p>
<p class="tx">Many wolves were here in the dream, all around. They waited for … for something. Something they could not explain to Perrin. They had a name for Rand, Shadowkiller. Perhaps they were here to witness what he would do.</p>
<p class="tx">“Perrin?” Gaul asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“He’s here, finally,” Perrin said softly. “He has entered the Pit of Doom.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand was going to need Perrin at some point during this fight. Unfortunately, Perrin couldn’t just stand here; there was work to be done. Gaul and he had, with help from the wolves, found Graendal near Cairhien. She had spoken to some people in their dreams. Darkfriends among the armies, perhaps?</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">She was peeking at Bashere’s dreams before that,</span> Perrin thought. <span class="epub-i1">Or so Lanfear claimed.</span> He didn’t trust her for a moment.</p>
<p class="tx">Anyway, he’d found Graendal earlier today, and had been planning to strike, when suddenly she had vanished. He knew how to track someone in the wolf dream when they <span class="epub-i1">shifted</span>, and he had followed her here, to Thakan’dar.</p>
<p class="tx">Her scent vanished sharply in the middle of the valley below. She’d Traveled back into the real world. Perrin wasn’t certain how much time had passed in the wolf dream; he and Gaul still had food, but it felt as if it had been days and days. Lanfear said that the closer Perrin came to Rand, the more time would distort. He could probably test that statement, at least.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">He is here, Young Bull!</span> The sending came, sudden and urgent, from a wolf named Sunrise, here in the valley. <span class="epub-i1">Slayer comes among us! Hurry!</span></p>
<p class="tx">Perrin growled, grabbed Gaul by the shoulder without a word and <span class="epub-i1">shifted</span> them. They appeared on the rocky path leading to a gaping hole in the rock above, the passage down to the Pit of Doom itself.</p>
<p class="tx">A wolf lay nearby, arrow in its side, smelling of death. Others howled in the near distance. The horrible wind whipped at him; Perrin lowered his head and charged into it, Gaul at his side. <span class="epub-i1">Inside, Young Bull,</span> a wolf sent. <span class="epub-i1">Inside the mouth of darkness.</span></p>
<p class="tx">Not daring to think about what he was doing, Perrin burst into a long, narrow chamber filled with jagged rocks projecting from the floor and ceiling. Ahead, something bright sent pulsing waves through the space. Perrin raised a hand against the light, vaguely catching sight of shapes at the end of the chamber.</p>
<p class="tx">Two men, locked in battle.</p>
<p class="tx">Two women, as if frozen.</p>
<p class="tx">And just a few feet from Perrin, Slayer, drawing his bow to his cheek.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin roared, hammer in his hand, and <span class="epub-i1">shifted</span> himself between Slayer and Rand. He slapped the arrow from the air with his hammer a split second after it was loosed. Slayer’s eyes widened, and he vanished.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin <span class="epub-i1">shifted</span> to Gaul, grabbing the man by the arm, then <span class="epub-i1">shifted</span> back to where Slayer had been and caught the scent of his location. “Be wary,” Perrin said, then <span class="epub-i1">shifted</span> them after the man.</p>
<p class="tx">They dropped into the middle of a group of people. They were <span class="epub-i1">Aiel</span>, but instead of wearing normal <span class="epub-i1">shoufa</span>, they had strange red veils.</p>
<p class="tx">The <span class="epub-i1">shift</span> hadn’t taken Perrin and Gaul far; this was a village of some sort, close enough for the peak of Shayol Ghul to be visible in the distance.</p>
<p class="tx">The red-veils attacked. Perrin wasn’t particularly surprised to find Aiel on the side of the Shadow. There were Darkfriends among all peoples. But why identify themselves with the color of their veils?</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin swung his hammer in a wide circle, keeping a group of them at bay, then <span class="epub-i1">shifted</span> behind them, crushing the head of one from behind. Gaul became a blur of spears and brown clothing, dodging around red-veils, stabbing, then vanishing—and then appearing and stabbing again. Yes, he’d learned quickly, more quickly than these red-veils apparently had, for they failed to keep up with him. Perrin smashed another one in the kneecap, then searched for Slayer.</p>
<p class="tx">There. He stood on a hillock above, watching. Perrin glanced at Gaul, who, between jumps, gave him a quick nod. There were eight red-veils left, but—</p>
<p class="tx">The earth underneath Gaul’s feet began to heave, exploding upward as Gaul jumped. Perrin managed to protect his friend, creating a steel plate beneath him to deflect the blast, but it was a close thing. Gaul landed shakily, and Perrin was forced to <span class="epub-i1">shift</span> to him and attack the red-veil coming at him from behind.</p>
<p class="tx">“Take care,” Perrin yelled at Gaul. “At least one of these fellows can channel!”</p>
<p class="tx">Light. As if Aiel fighting for the Shadow weren’t enough. Channeling Aiel. Channeling Aiel <span class="epub-i1">men</span>. Light!</p>
<p class="tx">As Perrin swung at another, Slayer arrived, a sword in one hand and a long hunting knife in the other—the type a man would use to skin his prey.</p>
<p class="tx">Growling, Perrin threw himself into the fight, and the two began a strange dance. One attacking the other, who vanished to appear nearby before attacking also. They spun about like that, one <span class="epub-i1">shifting</span>, then the other, each trying for an edge. Perrin just missed crushing Slayer with a blow, then nearly caught steel in his gut.</p>
<p class="tx">Gaul was proving very useful—Perrin would have had a horrible time trying to stand alone against both Slayer and the red-veils. Unfortunately, Gaul could do little but distract his foes, and was having a very difficult time managing that.</p>
<p class="tx">As a column of fire from one of the red-veils nearly took him, Perrin made his decision. He <span class="epub-i1">shifted</span> over to Gaul—and almost took a spear through the shoulder. Perrin turned the spear to cloth, and it bent on his skin.</p>
<p class="tx">Gaul started, seeing Perrin, then opened his mouth. Perrin didn’t give him a chance to speak. He grabbed his friend by the arm, then <span class="epub-i1">shifted</span> them away. They vanished just as flames welled up around them.</p>
<p class="tx">They reappeared before the entrance to the Pit of Doom. Perrin’s cloak was smoldering. Gaul was bleeding from the thigh. When had that happened?</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Are you there?</span> Perrin sent out, urgent.</p>
<p class="tx">Dozens upon dozens of wolves replied. <span class="epub-i1">We are here, Young Bull.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Do you lead us, Young Bull? The Last Hunt!</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Watch for Moonhunter, Young Bull. She stalks you like a lion in the high grass.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">I need you,</span> Perrin sent to the wolves. <span class="epub-i1">Slayer is here. Will you fight him, and the men with him, for me?</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">It is the Last Hunt,</span> one sent back as many others agreed to help him. They appeared on the slopes of Shayol Ghul. Perrin could smell their wariness; they did not like this place. It was not a place wolves came, not in the waking world, nor in the dream.</p>
<p class="tx">Slayer came for him. Either he realized Perrin would be guarding this place, or he intended to finish his attack on Rand. Either way, Perrin caught sight of him standing on the ridge up above, looking down into the valley—a dark figure with a bow and a black cloak whipping in the tempest’s winds. Beneath him, that battle still raged in dust and shadow. Thousands upon thousands of people dying, killing, struggling in the real world, only phantoms reaching this place.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin gripped his hammer. “Come try me,” he whispered. “You’ll find me a different foe this time.”</p>
<p class="tx">Slayer raised his bow, then loosed. The arrow split, becoming four, then sixteen, then a hail of shafts shooting toward Perrin.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin growled, then attacked the column of air that Slayer had created to stop the wind. It dissolved, and the raging gale caught the arrows, spinning them about.</p>
<p class="tx">Slayer appeared in front of Perrin, brandishing knife and sword. Perrin leaped at him as the red-veils appeared nearby. The wolves and Gaul dealt with them. This time, Perrin could focus on his enemy. He swung with a roar, slapping Slayer’s weapon away, then aiming for his head.</p>
<p class="tx">Slayer danced back and created stone arms that burst from the ground—throwing chips and shards of rock—to seize Perrin. Perrin concentrated, and they burst, tumbling back to the ground. He caught the sharp scent of Slayer’s surprise.</p>
<p class="tx">“You’re here in the flesh,” Slayer hissed.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin jumped for him, <span class="epub-i1">shifting</span> in midleap to reach the man more quickly. Slayer blocked with a shield that appeared on his arm. <span class="epub-i1">Mah’alleinir</span> left a large dent in the front as it was deflected.</p>
<p class="tx">Slayer vanished and appeared five strides back, on the rim of the pathway leading up to the cavern. “I’m so very glad you came hunting me, wolf pup. I was forbidden from seeking you, but now you are here. I skinned the sire; now the pup.”</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin launched himself at Slayer in a blurring leap, like those he used to bound from hilltop to hilltop. He crashed into the man, throwing them both off of the ledge in front of the opening to the Pit of Doom, sending them tumbling dozens of feet toward the ground.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin’s hammer was at his belt—he didn’t remember putting it there—but he didn’t want to hit this man with the hammer. He wanted to feel Slayer as he slammed a fist into the man’s face. The punch connected as they fell, but Slayer’s face was suddenly hard as stone.</p>
<p class="tx">In that moment, the fight became not one of flesh against flesh, but will against will. As they fell together, Perrin imagined Slayer’s skin becoming soft, giving beneath his punch, the bones brittle and cracking. Slayer, in response, imagined his skin as stone.</p>
<p class="tx">The result was that Slayer’s cheek became hard as rock, but Perrin cracked it anyway. They hit the ground, and rolled apart. When Slayer stood, his right cheek looked like that of a statue hit with a hammer, small cracks moving out over the skin.</p>
<p class="tx">Blood began to trickle through those cracks, and Slayer opened his eyes in shock. He raised a hand to his cheek, feeling the blood. The skin became flesh again, and stitches appeared, as if sewn by a master surgeon. One could not heal oneself in the wolf dream.</p>
<p class="tx">Slayer sneered at Perrin, then lunged. The two of them danced back and forth, surrounded by churning dust that formed the faces and bodies of people struggling for their lives in another place, another world. Perrin crashed through a pair of them, dust streaming from <span class="epub-i1">Mah’alleinir</span> as he swung. Slayer skidded back, creating a wind to blow him out of the way, then struck forward too quickly.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin became a wolf without a thought, Slayer’s sword passing over his head. Young Bull leaped into Slayer, slamming him backward through an impression of two Aiel fighting one another. Those exploded into sand and dust. Others formed to the sides, then blew away.</p>
<p class="tx">The howling tempest was a roar in Young Bull’s ears, and the dust ground into his skin and eyes. He rolled across Slayer, then lunged for his throat. <span class="epub-i1">How sweet it will be to taste this two-legs’ blood in my mouth.</span> Slayer <span class="epub-i1">shifted</span> away.</p>
<p class="tx">Young Bull became Perrin, with hammer at the ready, crouching on the plain of fragmentary fighting, changing people. <span class="epub-i1">Careful,</span> he thought to himself. <span class="epub-i1">You are a wolf, but more a man.</span> With a start, he realized that some of those impressions weren’t completely human. He saw a couple that were distinctly snakelike in appearance, though they faded quickly.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Does this place reflect other worlds?</span> he wondered, not certain what else to make of the phantoms.</p>
<p class="tx">Slayer came at him again, teeth clenched. Perrin’s hammer grew hot in his fingers, and his leg throbbed where he’d been hit and then Healed during his last fight with Slayer. He roared, letting Slayer’s sword close—letting it graze him on the cheek—as he crashed his own weapon into the man’s side.</p>
<p class="tx">Slayer vanished.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin followed through with the swing, and, for a moment, assumed he’d beaten the man. But no, his hammer had barely connected before Slayer disappeared. The man had been ready, waiting to <span class="epub-i1">shift</span>. Perrin felt blood moving through the hair of his beard toward his chin; that graze had cut a gash on his cheek much in the same place as he’d landed that blow on Slayer’s face.</p>
<p class="tx">He sniffed at the air, turning about, trying to catch the scent of Slayer’s location. Where had he gone? There was nothing.</p>
<p class="tx">Slayer hadn’t <span class="epub-i1">shifted</span> to another place in the wolf dream. He knew that Perrin could follow him. Instead, he must have jumped back into the waking world. Perrin howled, realizing he’d lost his prey. The wolf railed against this, a failed hunt, and it was a struggle for Perrin to bring himself back under control.</p>
<p class="tx">It was a scent that brought him back to it. Burning fur. It was accompanied by howls of pain.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin <span class="epub-i1">shifted</span> himself back to the top of the pathway. Wolves lay burned and dying amid the corpses of red-veils. Two of the men were still up, back to back, and incongruously, they’d lowered their veils. They had teeth filed to points, and were smiling, almost with madness, as they channeled. Burning wolf after wolf to char. Gaul had been forced to take shelter beside a rock, his clothing smoldering. He smelled of pain.</p>
<p class="tx">The two smiling channelers didn’t seem to care that their companions were bleeding to death on the ground around them. Perrin walked toward them. One raised a hand and released a jet of fire. Perrin turned it to smoke, then parted that by walking directly into it, the gray-black smoke eddying against him, then streaming off.</p>
<p class="tx">The other Aiel man also channeled, trying to rip the earth up beneath Perrin. Perrin knew that earth would not break, that it would resist the weaves. So it did. Perrin could not see the weaves, but he knew that the earth—suddenly far more solid—refused to budge as ordered.</p>
<p class="tx">The first Aiel reached for his spear with a growl, but Perrin grabbed him by the neck.</p>
<p class="tx">He wanted so badly to crush this man’s throat. He had lost Slayer <span class="epub-i1">again</span>, and wolves were dead because of these two. He held himself back. Slayer … Slayer deserved worse than death for what he had done. He didn’t know about these men, and he wasn’t certain if killing them here would kill them forever, without rebirth.</p>
<p class="tx">It seemed to him that everyone, including creatures like these, should have another chance. The red-veil in his hand struggled, trying with weaves of Air to envelop Perrin.</p>
<p class="tx">“You are an idiot,” Perrin said softly. Then he looked to the other one. “You too.”</p>
<p class="tx">Both blinked, then looked at him with eyes that grew slack. One started drooling. Perrin shook his head. Slayer hadn’t trained them at all. Even Gaul, after only a … how long had it been? Anyway, even Gaul knew not to be caught like that, in the grip of someone who could change the very capacity of one’s mind.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin had to keep thinking of them as idiots to maintain the transformation. He knelt, seeking among the wolves for the wounded he could help. He imagined bindings on the wounds of those who were hurt. They would heal quickly in this place. Wolves seemed to be able to do that. They had lost eight of their members, for whom Perrin howled. The others joined him, but there was no regret to their sendings. They had fought. That was what they had come to do.</p>
<p class="tx">After that, Perrin saw to the fallen red-veils. All were dead. Gaul limped up beside him, holding a burned arm. The wound was bad, but not immediately life-threatening.</p>
<p class="tx">“We need to take you out of here,” Perrin said to him, “and get you some Healing. I’m not certain what time it is, but I think we should go to Merrilor and wait for the gateway out.”</p>
<p class="tx">Gaul gave him a toothy grin. “I killed two of those myself, Perrin Aybara. One could channel. I think myself great with honor, then you slide in and take two <span class="epub-i1">captive</span>.” He shook his head. “Bain would laugh herself all the way back to the Three-fold Land if she saw this.”</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin turned to his two captives. Killing them here seemed heartlessly cruel, but to release them meant fighting them again—perhaps losing more wolves, more friends.</p>
<p class="tx">“I do not suspect these keep to <span class="epub-i1">ji’e’toh</span>,” Gaul said. “Would you take a man who could channel as <span class="epub-i1">gai’shain</span> anyway?” He shuddered visibly.</p>
<p class="tx">“Just kill them and be done with it,” Lanfear said.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin eyed her. He didn’t jump as she spoke—he had grown somewhat accustomed to the way she popped in and out. He did find it annoying, however.</p>
<p class="tx">“If I kill them here, will that kill them forever?”</p>
<p class="tx">“No,” she said. “It doesn’t work that way for men.”</p>
<p class="tx">Did he trust her? On this point, for some reason, he found that he did. Why would she lie? Still, killing unarmed men … they were barely more than babies here to him.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">No,</span> he thought, considering the dead wolves, <span class="epub-i1">not babies. Far more dangerous than that.</span></p>
<p class="tx">“Those two have been Turned,” she said, folding her arms, nodding to the two channelers. “Many are born to their life these days, but those two have the filed teeth. They were taken and Turned.”</p>
<p class="tx">Gaul muttered something. It sounded like an oath, but it also sounded reverent. It was in the Old Tongue, and Perrin didn’t catch its meaning. After that, however, Gaul raised a spear. He smelled regretful. “You spat in his eye, and so he uses you, my brothers. Horrible…”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Turned,</span> Perrin thought. Like those men at the Black Tower. He frowned, walking up and taking the head of one of the men in his hands. Could he <span class="epub-i1">will</span> the man back to the Light? If he could be forced to be evil, could he be restored?</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin hit something vast as he pushed against the minds of these men. His will bounced free, like a twig used to try beating down an iron gate. Perrin stumbled back.</p>
<p class="tx">He looked at Gaul, and shook his head. “I can do nothing for them.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I will do it,” Gaul said. “They are brothers.”</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin nodded, reluctant, as Gaul slit the throats of the two men. It was better this way. Still, it ripped Perrin up inside to see it. He hated what fighting did to people, what it did to him. The Perrin of months ago could never have stood and watched this. Light … if Gaul hadn’t done it, he would have himself. He knew it.</p>
<p class="tx">“You can be such a child,” Lanfear said, arms still folded beneath her breasts as she watched him. She sighed, then took him by the arm. A wave of icy Healing washed through him. The wound on his cheek closed.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin took a deep breath, then nodded toward Gaul.</p>
<p class="tx">“I am not your errand woman, wolf pup,” she said.</p>
<p class="tx">“You want to convince me that you’re not a foe?” he asked. “That’s a good place to start.”</p>
<p class="tx">She sighed, then waved impatiently for Gaul to approach. He did so, limping, and she Healed him.</p>
<p class="tx">A distant rumbling shook the cavern behind them. She looked at it, and narrowed her eyes. “I cannot stay here,” she said. Then she was gone.</p>
<p class="tx">“I do not know what to make of that one,” Gaul said, rubbing his arm where the clothing was burned, but the skin healed. “I believe she is gaming with us, Perrin Aybara. I do not know which game.”</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin grunted in agreement.</p>
<p class="tx">“This Slayer … he will return.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m thinking of a way to do something about that,” Perrin said, reaching to his waist where he’d tied the dreamspike to his belt with straps. He freed it. “Watch here,” he told Gaul, then entered the cavern.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin walked past those stones like teeth. It was hard to escape the feeling that he was crawling into the mouth of a Darkhound. The light at the bottom of the descent was blinding, but Perrin created a bubble around himself that was shaded, like glass that was only translucent. He could make out Rand and someone else striking at one another with swords at the lip of a deep pit.</p>
<p class="tx">No. It wasn’t a pit. Perrin gaped. The entire <span class="epub-i1">world</span> seemed to end here, the cavern opening into a vast nothingness. An eternal expanse, like the blackness of the Ways, only this one seemed to be <span class="epub-i1">pulling</span> him into it. Him, and everything else. He’d grown accustomed to the storm raging outside, so he hadn’t noticed the wind in the tunnel. Now that he paid attention, he could feel it streaming through the cavern into that hole.</p>
<p class="tx">Looking into that gap, he knew that he’d never understood blackness before, not really. <span class="epub-i1">This</span> was blackness. <span class="epub-i1">This</span> was nothingness. The absolute end of all. Other darkness was frightening because of what it might hide. This darkness was different; if this engulfed you, you would cease completely.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin stumbled back, though the wind blowing down the tunnel wasn’t strong. Just … steady, like a stream running into nowhere. Perrin gripped the dreamspike, then forced himself to turn away from Rand. Someone knelt on the floor nearby, her head bowed, braced as if against some great force coming from the nothingness. Moiraine? Yes, and that was Nynaeve kneeling to her right.</p>
<p class="tx">The veil between worlds was very thin here. If he could see Nynaeve and Moiraine, perhaps they could see or hear him.</p>
<p class="tx">He stepped up to Nynaeve. “Nynaeve? Can you hear me?”</p>
<p class="tx">She blinked, turning her head. Yes, she could hear him! But she could not see him, it seemed. She searched about, confused as she clung to the stone teeth of the floor as if for life itself.</p>
<p class="tx">“Nynaeve!” Perrin yelled.</p>
<p class="tx">“Perrin?” she whispered, looking about. “Where are you?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m going to do something, Nynaeve,” he said. “I will make it impossible to create gateways into this place. If you want to Travel to or from this area, you’ll need to create your gateway out in front of the cavern. All right?”</p>
<p class="tx">She nodded, still looking about for him. Apparently, though the real world reflected in the wolf dream, it didn’t work the other way around. Perrin rammed the dreamspike into the ground, then activated it as Lanfear had shown him, creating the bubble of purple just around the cavern itself. He hurried back into the tunnel, emerging through a wall of purple glass to rejoin Gaul and the wolves.</p>
<p class="tx">“Light,” Gaul said. “I was about to go search for you. Why did it take so long?”</p>
<p class="tx">“So long?” Perrin asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“You were gone at least two hours.”</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin shook his head. “It’s the Bore playing with our sense of time. Well, at least with that dreamspike in place, Slayer will have trouble reaching Rand.”</p>
<p class="tx">After having Slayer use the dreamspike against him, it was satisfying to turn the <span class="epub-i1">ter’angreal</span> against the man. Perrin had made the protective bubble just large enough to fit inside the cavern and shelter Rand, the Bore and those with him. The placement meant all of the borders of the dome save the one here at the front were inside rock.</p>
<p class="tx">Slayer would not be able to jump into the middle of the cavern and strike; he would have to enter through the front. Either that, or find a way to burrow through the rock, which Perrin supposed was possible here in the wolf dream. However, it would slow him, and that was what Rand needed.</p>
<p class="tx">“I need you to protect this place,” Perrin sent to the gathered wolves, many of whom were still licking their wounds. “Shadowkiller fights inside, hunting the most dangerous prey this world has known. We must not let Slayer reach him.”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">We will guard this place, Young Bull,</span> one sent. <span class="epub-i1">Others gather. He will not pass us.</span></p>
<p class="tx">“Can you do this?” Perrin sent an image of wolves spaced through the Borderlands, relaying messages quickly between themselves. There were thousands upon thousands of them roaming the area.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin was proud of his sending. He didn’t send it as words, or as images, but as a concept mixed with scents, with a hint of instinct. With the wolves positioned as he sent, they could send to him through the network almost instantly if Slayer returned.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">We can do it,</span> the wolves sent.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin nodded, then waved to Gaul.</p>
<p class="tx">“We are not staying?” he asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“There is too much happening,” Perrin said. “Time moves too slowly here. I don’t want the war to pass us by.”</p>
<p class="tx">Besides, there was still the matter of whatever Graendal was doing.</p>
