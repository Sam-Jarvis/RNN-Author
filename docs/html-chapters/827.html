<p class="chapterOpenerText">“Today,” King Elhokar announced, riding beneath the bright open sky, “is an excellent day to slay a god. Wouldn’t you say?”</p>
<p class="para">“Undoubtedly, Your Majesty.” Sadeas’s reply was smooth, quick, and said with a knowing smile. “One might say that gods, as a rule, should fear the Alethi nobility. Most of us at least.”</p>
<p class="para">Adolin gripped his reins a little more tightly; it put him on edge every time Highprince Sadeas spoke.</p>
<p class="para">“Do we have to ride up here at the front?” Renarin whispered.</p>
<p class="para">“I want to listen,” Adolin replied softly.</p>
<p class="para">He and his brother rode near the front of the column, near the king and his highprinces. Behind them extended a grand procession: a thousand soldiers in Kholin blue, dozens of servants, and even women in palanquins to scribe accounts of the hunt. Adolin glanced at them all as he reached for his canteen.</p>
<p class="para">He was wearing his Shardplate, and so he had to be careful when grabbing it, lest he crush it. One’s muscles reacted with increased speed, strength, and dexterity when wearing the armor, and it took practice to use it correctly. Adolin was still occasionally caught by surprise, though he’d held this suit—inherited from his mother’s side of the family—since his sixteenth birthday. That was now seven years past.</p>
<p class="para">He turned and took a long drink of lukewarm water. Sadeas rode to the king’s left, and Dalinar—Adolin’s father—was a solid figure riding at the king’s right. The final highprince on the hunt was Vamah, who wasn’t a Shardbearer.</p>
<p class="para">The king was resplendent in his golden Shardplate—of course, Plate could make any man look regal. Even <span class="italic1">Sadeas</span> looked impressive when wearing his red Plate, though his bulbous face and ruddy complexion weakened the effect. Sadeas and the king flaunted their Plate. And…well, perhaps Adolin did too. He’d had his painted blue, a few ornamentations welded onto the helm and pauldrons to give an extra look of danger. How could you <span class="italic1">not</span> show off when wearing something as grand as Shardplate?</p>
<p class="para">Adolin took another drink, listening to the king talk about his excitement for the hunt. Only one Shardbearer in the procession—indeed, only one Shardbearer in the entirety of the ten armies—used no paint or ornamentations on his Plate. Dalinar Kholin. Adolin’s father preferred to leave his armor its natural slate-grey color.</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar rode beside the king, his face somber. He rode with his helm tied to his saddle, exposing a square face topped by short black hair that had gone white at the temples. Few women had ever called Dalinar Kholin handsome; his nose was the wrong shape, his features blocky rather than delicate. It was the face of a warrior.</p>
<p class="para">He rode astride a massive black Ryshadium stallion, one of the largest horses that Adolin had ever seen—and while the king and Sadeas looked regal in their armor, somehow Dalinar managed to look like a soldier. To him, the Plate was not an ornament. It was a tool. He never seemed to be surprised by the strength or speed the armor lent him. It was as if, for Dalinar Kholin, wearing his Plate was his natural state—it was the times without that were abnormal. Perhaps that was one reason he’d earned the reputation of being one of the greatest warriors and generals who ever lived.</p>
<p class="para">Adolin found himself wishing, passionately, that his father would do a little more these days to live up to that reputation.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">He’s thinking about the visions,</span> Adolin thought, regarding his father’s distant expression and troubled eyes. “It happened again last night,” Adolin said softly to Renarin. “During the highstorm.”</p>
<p class="para">“I know,” Renarin said. His voice was measured, controlled. He always paused before he replied to a question, as if testing the words in his mind. Some women Adolin knew said Renarin’s ways made them feel as if he were dissecting them with his mind. They’d shiver when they spoke of him, though Adolin had never found his younger brother the least bit discomforting.</p>
<p class="para">“What do you think they mean?” Adolin asked, speaking quietly so only Renarin could hear. “Father’s…episodes.”</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class="para">“Renarin, we <span class="italic1">can’t</span> keep ignoring them. The soldiers are talking. Rumors are spreading through all ten armies!”</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar Kholin was going mad. Whenever a highstorm came, he fell to the floor and began to shake. Then he began raving in gibberish. Often, he’d stand, blue eyes delusional and wild, swinging and flailing. Adolin had to restrain him lest he hurt himself or others.</p>
<p class="para">“He sees things,” Adolin said. “Or he thinks he does.”</p>
<p class="para">Adolin’s grandfather had suffered from delusions. When he’d grown old, he’d thought he was back at war. Was that what happened to Dalinar? Was he reliving youthful battles, days when he’d earned his renown? Or was it that terrible night he saw over and over, the night when his brother had been murdered by the Assassin in White? And why did he so often mention the Knights Radiant soon after his episodes?</p>
<p class="para">It all made Adolin feel sick. Dalinar was the Blackthorn, a genius of the battlefield and a living legend. Together, he and his brother had reunited Alethkar’s warring highprinces after centuries of strife. He had defeated countless challengers in duels, had won dozens of battles. The entire kingdom looked up to him. And now this.</p>
<p class="para">What did you do, as a son, when the man you loved—the greatest man alive—started to lose his wits?</p>
<p class="para">Sadeas was speaking about a recent victory. He’d won another gemheart two days back, and the king—it appeared—hadn’t heard of it. Adolin tensed at the boasts.</p>
<p class="para">“We should move back,” Renarin said.</p>
<p class="para">“We are of rank enough to be here,” Adolin said.</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t like how you get when you’re around Sadeas.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">We have to keep an eye on the man, Renarin,</span> Adolin thought. <span class="italic1">He knows Father is weakening. He’ll try to strike.</span> Adolin forced himself to smile, however. He tried to be relaxed and confident for Renarin. Generally, that wasn’t difficult. He’d happily spend his entire life dueling, lounging, and courting the occasional pretty girl. Of late, however, life didn’t seem content to let him enjoy its simple pleasures.</p>
<p class="para">“…model of courage lately, Sadeas,” the king was saying. “You’ve done very well in capturing gemhearts. You are to be commended.”</p>
<p class="para">“Thank you, Your Majesty. Though the competition grows unexciting, as some people don’t seem interested in participating. I guess even the best weapons eventually grow dull.”</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar, who might once have responded to the veiled slur, said nothing. Adolin gritted his teeth. It was flat-out unconscionable for Sadeas to be taking shots at his father in his present state. Perhaps Adolin should offer the pompous bastard a challenge. You didn’t duel highprinces—it just wasn’t done, not unless you were ready to make a big storm of it. But maybe he was. Maybe—</p>
<p class="para">“Adolin…” Renarin said warningly.</p>
<p class="para">Adolin looked to the side. He’d held out his hand, as if to summon his Blade. He picked up his reins with the hand instead. <span class="italic1">Storming man,</span> he thought. <span class="italic1">Leave my father alone.</span></p>
<p class="para">“Why don’t we talk about the hunt?” Renarin said. As usual, the younger Kholin rode with a straight back and perfect posture, eyes hidden behind his spectacles, a model of propriety and solemnity. “Aren’t you excited?”</p>
<p class="para">“Bah,” Adolin said. “I never find hunts as interesting as everyone says they’re going to be. I don’t care how big the beast is—in the end, it’s really just butchery.”</p>
<p class="para">Now, dueling, <span class="italic1">that</span> was exciting. The feel of the Shardblade in your hand, of facing someone crafty, skilled, and careful. Man against man, strength against strength, mind against mind. Hunting some dumb beast just couldn’t compare to that.</p>
<p class="para">“Maybe you should have invited Janala along,” Renarin said.</p>
<p class="para">“She wouldn’t have come,” Adolin said. “Not after…well, you know. Rilla was very vocal yesterday. It was best to just leave.”</p>
<p class="para">“You really should have been wiser in your treatment of her,” Renarin said, sounding disapproving.</p>
<p class="para">Adolin mumbled a noncommittal reply. It wasn’t <span class="italic1">his</span> fault that his relationships often burned out quickly. Well, technically, this time it <span class="italic1">was</span> his fault. But it wasn’t usually. This was just an oddity</p>
<p class="para">The king began complaining about something. Renarin and Adolin had lagged behind, and Adolin couldn’t hear what was being said.</p>
<p class="para">“Let’s ride up closer,” Adolin said, nudging his mount forward.</p>
<p class="para">Renarin rolled his eyes, but followed.</p>
<p class="centerImage3"><img src="../images/00656.jpeg" alt="image" class="epubimage12"/></p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="italic1">Unite them.</span></p>
<p class="para">The words whispered in Dalinar’s mind. He couldn’t rid himself of them. They consumed him as he trotted Gallant across a rocky, boulder-strewn plateau on the Shattered Plains.</p>
<p class="para">“Shouldn’t we be there by now?” the king asked.</p>
<p class="para">“We’re still two or three plateaus away from the hunting site, Your Majesty,” Dalinar said, distracted. “It will be another hour, perhaps, observing proper protocols. If we had vantage, we could probably see the pavilion to—”</p>
<p class="para">“Vantage? Would that rock formation up ahead do?”</p>

<p class="para">“I suppose,” Dalinar said, inspecting the towerlike length of rock. “We could send scouts to check.”</p>
<p class="para">“Scouts? Bah. I need a run, Uncle. I’ll bet you five full broams that I can beat you to the top.” And with that, the king galloped away in a thunder of hooves, leaving behind a shocked group of lighteyes, attendants, and guards.</p>
<p class="para">“Storm it!” Dalinar cursed, kicking his horse into motion. “Adolin, you have command! Secure the next plateau, just in case.”</p>
<p class="para">His son, who had been lagging behind, nodded sharply. Dalinar galloped after the king, a figure in golden armor and a long blue cape. Hoofbeats pounded the stone, rock formations whipping past. Ahead, the steep, spike-like spire of rock rose from the lip of the plateau. Such formations were common out here on the Shattered Plains.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Curse that boy.</span> Dalinar still thought of Elhokar as a boy, though the king was in his twenty-seventh year. But sometimes he acted like a boy. Why couldn’t he give more warning before leaping into one of these stunts?</p>
<p class="para">Still, as Dalinar rode, he admitted to himself that it <span class="italic1">did</span> feel good to charge freely, helm off, face to the wind. His pulse picked up as he got into the race, and he forgave its impetuous beginning. For the moment, Dalinar let himself forget his troubles and the words that had been echoing in his head.</p>
<p class="para">The king wanted a race? Well, Dalinar would give him one.</p>
<p class="para">He charged past the king. Elhokar’s stallion was a good breed, but it could never match Gallant, who was a full Ryshadium, two hands taller and much stronger than an ordinary horse. The animals chose their own riders, and only a dozen men in all of the warcamps were so fortunate. Dalinar was one, Adolin another.</p>
<p class="para">In seconds, Dalinar reached the formation’s base. He threw himself from the saddle while Gallant was still moving. He hit hard, but the Shardplate absorbed the impact, stone crunching beneath his metal boots as he skidded to a stop. Men who hadn’t ever worn Plate—particularly those who were accustomed to its inferior cousin, simple plate and mail—could never understand. Shardplate wasn’t merely armor. It was so much more.</p>
<p class="para">He ran to the bottom of the rock formation as Elhokar galloped up behind. Dalinar leaped—Plate-assisted legs propelling him up some eight feet—and grabbed a handhold in the stone. With a heave, he pulled himself up, the Plate lending him the strength of many men. The Thrill of contest began to rise within him. It wasn’t nearly as keen as the Thrill of battle, but it was a worthy substitute.</p>
<p class="para">Rock scraped below. Elhokar had begun to climb as well. Dalinar didn’t look down. He kept his eyes fixed on the small natural platform at the top of the forty-foot-high formation. He groped with steel-covered fingers, finding another handhold. The gauntlets covered his hands, but the ancient armor somehow transferred sensation to his fingers. It was as if he were wearing thin leather gloves.</p>
<p class="para">A scraping sound came from the right, accompanied by a voice cursing softly. Elhokar had taken a different path, hoping to pass Dalinar, but the king had found himself at a section without handholds above. His progress was stalled.</p>
<p class="para">The king’s golden Shardplate glittered as he glanced at Dalinar. Elhokar set his jaw and looked upward, then launched himself in a powerful leap toward an outcropping.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Fool boy,</span> Dalinar thought, watching the king seem to hang in the air for a moment before he snatched the projecting rock and dangled. Then the king pulled himself up and continued to climb.</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar moved furiously, stone grinding beneath his metal fingertips, chips falling free. The wind ruffled his cape. He heaved, strained, and pushed himself, managing to get just ahead of the king. The top was mere feet away. The Thrill sang at him. He reached for the goal, determined to win. He couldn’t lose. He had to—</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Unite them.</span></p>
<p class="para">He hesitated, not quite certain why, and let his nephew get ahead.</p>
<p class="para">Elhokar hauled himself to his feet atop the rock formation, then laughed in triumph. He turned toward Dalinar, holding out a hand. “Stormwinds, Uncle, but you made a fine race of it! At the end there, I thought for sure you had me.”</p>
<p class="para">The triumph and joy in Elhokar’s face brought a smile to Dalinar’s lips. The younger man needed victories these days. Even little ones would do him good. Gloryspren—like tiny golden translucent globes of light—began to pop into existence around him, attracted by his sense of accomplishment. Blessing himself for hesitating, Dalinar took the king’s hand, letting Elhokar pull him up. There was just enough room on top of the natural tower for them both.</p>
<p class="para">Breathing deeply, Dalinar slapped the king on the back with a clank of metal on metal. “That <span class="italic1">was</span> a fine contest, Your Majesty. And you played it very well.”</p>
<p class="para">The king beamed. His golden Shardplate gleamed in the noonday sun; he had his faceplate up, revealing light yellow eyes, a strong nose, and a clean-shaven face that was almost too handsome, with its full lips, broad forehead, and firm chin. Gavilar had looked like that too, before he’d suffered a broken nose and that terrible scar on his chin.</p>
<p class="para">Below them, the Cobalt Guard and some of Elhokar’s attendants rode up, including Sadeas. His Plate gleamed red, though he wasn’t a full Shardbearer—he had only the Plate, not the Blade.</p>

<p class="para">Dalinar looked up. From this height, he could scan a large swath of the Shattered Plains, and he had an odd moment of familiarity. He felt as if he’d been atop this vantage point before, looking down at a broken landscape.</p>
<p class="para">The moment was gone in a heartbeat.</p>
<p class="para">“There,” Elhokar said, pointing with a golden, gauntleted hand. “I can see our destination.”</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar shaded his eyes, picking out a large cloth pavilion three plateaus away, flying the king’s flag. Wide, permanent bridges led there; they were relatively close to the Alethi side of the Shattered Plains, on plateaus Dalinar himself maintained. A fully grown chasmfiend living here was his to hunt, the wealth at its heart his privilege to claim.</p>
<p class="para">“You were correct again, Uncle,” Elhokar said.</p>
<p class="para">“I try to make a habit of it.”</p>
<p class="para">“I can’t blame you for that, I suppose. Though I can beat you at a race now and then.”</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar smiled. “I felt like a youth again, chasing after your father on some ridiculous challenge.”</p>
<p class="para">Elhokar’s lips tightened to a thin line, and the gloryspren faded away. Mentioning Gavilar soured him; he felt others compared him unfavorably to the old king. Unfortunately, he was often right.</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar moved on quickly. “We must have seemed of the ten fools, charging away like that. I do wish you’d given me more notice to prepare your honor guard. This <span class="italic1">is</span> a war zone.”</p>
<p class="para">“Bah. You worry too much, Uncle. The Parshendi haven’t attacked this close to our side of the Plains in years.”</p>
<p class="para">“Well, you seemed worried about your safety two nights ago.”</p>
<p class="para">Elhokar sighed audibly. “How many times must I explain this to you, Uncle? I can face enemy soldiers with Blade in hand. It’s what they might send when we’re not looking, when all is dark and quiet, that you should be trying to protect me from.”</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar didn’t reply. Elhokar’s nervousness—paranoia, even—regarding assassination was strong. But who could blame him, considering what had happened to his father?</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">I’m sorry, brother,</span> he thought, as he did every time he thought of the night when Gavilar had died. Alone, without his brother to protect him.</p>
<p class="para">“I looked into the matter you asked me about,” Dalinar said, forcing away bad memories.</p>
<p class="para">“You did? What did you discover?”</p>
<p class="para">“Not much, I’m afraid. There were no traces of trespassers on your balcony, and none of the servants reported any strangers in the area.”</p>
<p class="para">“There <span class="italic1">was</span> someone watching me in the darkness that night.”</p>

<p class="para">“If so, they haven’t returned, Your Majesty. And they left no clues behind.”</p>
<p class="para">Elhokar seemed dissatisfied, and the silence between them grew stark. Below, Adolin met with scouts and prepared for the troop crossing. Elhokar had protested at how many men Dalinar had brought. Most of them wouldn’t be needed on the hunt—the Shardbearers, not the soldiers, would slay the beast. But Dalinar <span class="italic1">would</span> see his nephew protected. Parshendi raids had grown less bold during the years of fighting—Alethi scribes guessed their numbers were a quarter their prior strength, though it was difficult to judge—but the king’s presence might be enough to entice them into a reckless attack.</p>
<p class="para">The winds blew across Dalinar, returning with them that faint familiarity he’d felt a few minutes before. Standing atop a peak, looking out at desolation. A sense of an awful and amazing perspective.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">That’s it,</span> he thought. <span class="italic1">I</span> did <span class="italic1">stand atop a formation like this. It happened during—</span></p>
<p class="para">During one of his visions. The very first one.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">You must unite them,</span> the strange, booming words had told him. <span class="italic1">You must prepare. Build of your people a fortress of strength and peace, a wall to resist the winds. Cease squabbling and unite. The Everstorm comes.</span></p>
<p class="para">“Your Majesty,” Dalinar found himself saying. “I…” He trailed off as quickly as he began. What could he say? That he’d been seeing visions? That—in defiance of all doctrine and common sense—he thought those visions might be from the Almighty? That he thought they should withdraw from the battlefield and go back to Alethkar?</p>
<p class="para">Pure foolishness.</p>
<p class="para">“Uncle?” the king asked. “What do you want?”</p>
<p class="para">“Nothing. Come, let’s get back to the others.”</p>
<p class="centerImage3"><img src="../images/00656.jpeg" alt="image" class="epubimage12"/></p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Adolin twisted one of his hogshide reins around his finger while he sat astride his horse, awaiting the next batch of scout reports. He’d managed to get his mind off his father and Sadeas, and was instead contemplating just how he was going to explain his falling out with Rilla in a way that would earn him some sympathy with Janala.</p>
<p class="para">Janala loved ancient epic poems; could he phrase the falling out in dramatic terms? He smiled, thinking of her luxurious black hair and sly smile. She’d been daring, teasing at him while he was known to be courting someone else. He could use that too. Maybe Renarin was right, perhaps he should have invited her on the hunt. The prospect of fighting a greatshell would have been far more interesting to him if someone beautiful and long-haired were watching….</p>

<p class="para">“New scout reports are in, Brightlord Adolin,” Tarilar said, jogging up.</p>
<p class="para">Adolin turned his mind back to business. He’d taken up position with some members of the Cobalt Guard beside the base of the high rock formation where his father and the king were still conversing. Tarilar, scoutlord, was a gaunt-faced man with a thick chest and arms. From some angles, his head looked so relatively small on his body that it appeared to have been smashed.</p>
<p class="para">“Proceed,” Adolin said.</p>
<p class="para">“Advance runners have met with the lead huntmaster and have returned. There are no sightings of Parshendi on any nearby plateaus. Companies Eighteen and Twenty-one are in position, though there are still eight companies to go.”</p>
<p class="para">Adolin nodded. “Have Company Twenty-one send some outriders to watch from plateaus fourteen and sixteen. And two each on plateaus six and eight.”</p>
<p class="para">“Six and eight? Behind us?”</p>
<p class="para">“If I were going to ambush the party,” Adolin said, “I’d round back this way and cut us off from fleeing. Do it.”</p>
<p class="para">Tarilar saluted. “Yes, Brightlord.” He hurried away to pass the orders.</p>
<p class="para">“You really think that’s necessary?” Renarin asked, riding up beside Adolin.</p>
<p class="para">“No. But Father will want it done anyway. You know he will.”</p>
<p class="para">There was motion up above. Adolin looked up just in time to see the king leap off the rock formation, cape streaming behind him as he fell some forty feet to the rock floor. Adolin’s father stood at the lip above, and Adolin could imagine him cursing to himself at what he saw as a foolhardy move. Shardplate could withstand a fall that far, but it was high enough to be dangerous.</p>
<p class="para">Elhokar landed with an audible crack, throwing up chips of stone and a large puff of Stormlight. He managed to stay upright. Adolin’s father took a safer way down, descending to a lower ledge before jumping.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">He seems to take the safer pathway more and more often lately,</span> Adolin thought idly. <span class="italic1">And he often seems to find reasons to give me command as well.</span> Thoughtful, Adolin trotted his horse out of the shadow of the rock formation. He needed to get a report from the rear guard—his father would want to hear it.</p>
<p class="para">His path took him past a group of lighteyes from Sadeas’s party. The king, Sadeas, and Vamah each had a collection of attendants, aides, and sycophants accompanying them. Looking at them riding in their comfortable silks, open-fronted jackets, and shade-covered palanquins made Adolin aware of his sweaty, bulky armor. Shardplate was wonderful and empowering, but beneath a hot sun, it could still leave a man wishing for something less confining.</p>

<p class="para">But, of course, he couldn’t have worn casual clothing like the others. Adolin was to be in uniform, even on a hunt. The Alethi War Codes commanded it. Never mind that nobody had followed those Codes in centuries. Or at least nobody but Dalinar Kholin—and, by extension, his sons.</p>
<p class="para">Adolin passed a pair of lounging lighteyes, Vartian and Lomard, two of Sadeas’s recent hangers-on. They were talking loudly enough that Adolin could hear. Probably on purpose. “Chasing after the king again,” Vartian said, shaking his head. “Like pet axehounds nipping at their master’s heels.”</p>
<p class="para">“Shameful,” Lomard said. “How long has it been since Dalinar won a gemheart? The only time he can get one is when the king lets them hunt it without competition.”</p>
<p class="para">Adolin set his jaw and rode on. His father’s interpretation of the Codes wouldn’t let Adolin challenge a man to a duel while he was on duty or in command. He chafed at the needless restrictions, but Dalinar had spoken as Adolin’s commanding officer. That meant there was no room for argument. He’d have to find a way to duel the two idiot sycophants in another setting, put them in their places. Unfortunately, he couldn’t duel everyone who spoke out against his father.</p>
<p class="para">The biggest problem was, the things they said had some real truth to them. The Alethi princedoms were like kingdoms unto themselves, still mostly autonomous despite having accepted Gavilar as king. Elhokar had inherited the throne, and Dalinar, by right, had taken the Kholin Princedom as his own.</p>
<p class="para">However, most of the highprinces gave only token nods to the paramount rule of the king. That left Elhokar without land that was specifically his own. He tended to act like a highprince of the Kholin Princedom, taking great interest in its day-to-day management. So, while Dalinar should have been a ruler unto himself, he instead bent to Elhokar’s whims and dedicated his resources to protecting his nephew. That made him weak in the eyes of the others—nothing more than a glorified bodyguard.</p>
<p class="para">Once, when Dalinar had been feared, men had not dared whisper about these things. But now? Dalinar went on fewer and fewer plateau assaults, and his forces lagged behind in capturing precious gemhearts. While the others fought and won, Dalinar and his sons spent their time in bureaucratic administration.</p>
<p class="para">Adolin wanted to be out there fighting, killing Parshendi. What was the good of following the Codes of War when he rarely got to <span class="italic1">go</span> to war? <span class="italic1">It’s the fault of those delusions.</span> Dalinar wasn’t weak, and he certainly wasn’t a coward, no matter what people said. He was just troubled.</p>
<p class="para">The rearguard captains weren’t formed up yet, so Adolin decided to give the king a report instead. He trotted up toward the king—joining Sadeas, who was doing the same. Not unexpectedly, Sadeas frowned at him. The highprince hated that Adolin had a Blade while Sadeas had none; he had coveted one for years now.</p>
<p class="para">Adolin met the highprince’s eyes, smiling. <span class="italic1">Anytime you want to duel me for my Blade, Sadeas, go ahead and try.</span> What Adolin wouldn’t do to get that eel of a man in the dueling ring.</p>
<p class="para">When Dalinar and the king rode up, and Adolin spoke quickly, before Sadeas could speak. “Your Majesty, I have scout reports.”</p>
<p class="para">The king sighed. “More of nothing, I expect. Honestly, Uncle, must we have a report on every little detail of the army?”</p>
<p class="para">“We are at war, Your Majesty,” Dalinar said.</p>
<p class="para">Elhokar sighed sufferingly.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">You’re a strange man, cousin,</span> Adolin thought. Elhokar saw murderers in every shadow, yet often dismissed the Parshendi threat. He’d go charging off like he had today, with no honor guard, and would leap off a forty-foot-tall rock formation. Yet he’d stay up nights, terrified of assassination.</p>
<p class="para">“Give your report, son,” Dalinar said.</p>
<p class="para">Adolin hesitated, now feeling foolish at the lack of substance to what he had to say. “The scouts have seen no sign of the Parshendi. They’ve met with the huntmaster. Two companies have secured the next plateau, and the other eight will need some time to cross. We’re close, though.”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, we saw from above,” Elhokar said. “Perhaps a few of us could ride ahead….”</p>
<p class="para">“Your Majesty,” Dalinar said. “The point of bringing my troops along would be somewhat undermined if you left them behind.”</p>
<p class="para">Elhokar rolled his eyes. Dalinar did not yield, his expression as immobile as the rocks around them. Seeing him like that—firm, unyielding before a challenge—made Adolin smile with pride. Why couldn’t he be like this <span class="italic1">all</span> of the time? Why did he back down so often before insults or challenges?</p>
<p class="para">“Very well,” the king said. “We’ll take a break and wait while the army crosses.”</p>
<p class="para">The king’s attendants responded immediately, men climbing off horses, women having their palanquin bearers set them down. Adolin moved off to get that rearguard report. By the time he returned, Elhokar was practically holding court. His servants had set up a small awning to give him shade, and others served wine. Chilled, using one of the new fabrials that could make things cold.</p>
<p class="para">Adolin removed his helm and wiped his brow with his saddle rag, again wishing he could join the others and enjoy a little wine. Instead, he climbed down from his horse and went looking for his father. Dalinar stood outside the awning, gauntleted hands clasped behind his back, looking eastward, toward the Origin—the distant, the unseen place where highstorms began. Renarin stood at his side, looking out as well, as if trying to see what it was that his father found so interesting.</p>
<p class="para">Adolin rested a hand on his brother’s shoulder, and Renarin smiled at him. Adolin knew that his brother—now nineteen years old—felt out of place. Though he wore a side sword, he barely knew how to use it. His blood weakness made it difficult for him to spend any reasonable amount of time practicing.</p>
<p class="para">“Father,” Adolin said. “Maybe the king was right. Perhaps we should have moved on quickly. I’d rather have this entire hunt over with.”</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar looked at him. “When I was your age, I looked forward to a hunt like this. Taking down a greatshell was the highlight of a young man’s year.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Not this again,</span> Adolin thought. Why was everyone so offended that he didn’t find hunts exciting? “It’s just an oversized chull, Father.”</p>
<p class="para">“These ‘oversized chulls’ grow to fifty feet tall and are capable of crushing even a man in Shardplate.”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes,” Adolin said, “and so we’ll bait it for hours while baking in the hot sun. If it decides to show up, we’ll pelt it with arrows, only closing in once it’s so weak it can barely resist as we hack it to death with Shardblades. Very honorable.”</p>
<p class="para">“It’s not a duel,” Dalinar said, “it’s a hunt. A grand tradition.”</p>
<p class="para">Adolin raised an eyebrow at him.</p>
<p class="para">“And yes,” Dalinar added. “It can be tedious. But the king was insistent.”</p>
<p class="para">“You’re just still smarting over the problems with Rilla, Adolin,” Renarin said. “You were eager a week ago. You really should have invited Janala.”</p>
<p class="para">“Janala hates hunts. Thinks they’re barbarous.”</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar frowned. “Janala? Who’s Janala?”</p>
<p class="para">“Daughter of Brightlord Lustow,” Adolin said.</p>
<p class="para">“And you’re courting her?”</p>
<p class="para">“Not yet, but I’ve sure been trying.”</p>
<p class="para">“What happened to that other girl? The short one, with the fondness for silver hair ribbons?”</p>
<p class="para">“Deeli?” Adolin said. “Father, I stopped courting her over two months back!”</p>
<p class="para">“You did?”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar rubbed his chin.</p>
<p class="para">“There have been two between her and Janala, Father,” Adolin noted. “You really need to pay more attention.”</p>
<p class="para">“Almighty help any man who tries to keep track of your tangled courtships, son.”</p>

<p class="para">“The most recent was Rilla,” Renarin said.</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar frowned. “And you two…”</p>
<p class="para">“Had some problems yesterday,” Adolin said. He coughed, determined to change the subject. “Anyway, don’t you find it odd that the king would insist on coming to hunt the chasmfiend himself?”</p>
<p class="para">“Not particularly. It isn’t often that a full-sized one makes its way out here, and the king rarely gets to go on plateau runs. This is a way for him to fight.”</p>
<p class="para">“But he’s so paranoid! Why does he now want to go and hunt, exposing himself on the Plains?”</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar looked toward the king’s awning. “I know he seems odd, son. But the king is more complex a man than many give him credit for being. He worries that his subjects see him as a coward because of how much he fears assassins, and so he finds ways to prove his courage. Foolish ways, sometimes—but he’s not the first man I’ve known who will face battle without fear, yet cower in terror about knives in the shadows. The hallmark of insecurity is bravado.</p>
<p class="para">“The king is learning to lead. He needs this hunt. He needs to prove to himself, and to others, that he’s still strong and worthy to command a kingdom at war. That’s why I encouraged him. A successful hunt, under controlled circumstances, could bolster his reputation and his confidence.”</p>
<p class="para">Adolin slowly closed his mouth, his father’s words cutting down his complaints. Strange, how much the king’s actions made sense when explained that way. Adolin looked up at his father. <span class="italic1">How can the others whisper that he’s a coward? Can’t they see his wisdom?</span></p>
<p class="para">“Yes,” Dalinar said, eyes growing distant. “Your nephew is a better man than many think him, and a stronger king. At least he could be. I just have to figure out how to persuade him to leave the Shattered Plains.”</p>
<p class="para">Adolin started. “<span class="italic1">What?</span>”</p>
<p class="para">“I didn’t understand at first,” Dalinar continued. “Unite them. I’m supposed to unite them. But aren’t they already united? We fight together here on the Shattered Plains. We have a common enemy in the Parshendi. I’m beginning to see that we’re united only in name. The highprinces give lip service to Elhokar, but this war—this siege—is a game to them. A competition against one another.</p>
<p class="para">“We can’t unite them here. We need to return to Alethkar and stabilize our homeland, learn how to work together as one nation. The Shattered Plains divide us. The others worry too much about winning wealth and prestige.”</p>
<p class="para">“Wealth and prestige are what being Alethi is <span class="italic1">about</span>, Father!” Adolin said. Was he really hearing this? “What of the Vengeance Pact? The highprinces vowed to seek retribution upon the Parshendi!”</p>
<p class="para">“And we <span class="italic1">have</span> sought it.” Dalinar looked to Adolin. “I realize that it sounds terrible, son, but some things are more important than vengeance. I loved Gavilar. I miss him fiercely, and I hate the Parshendi for what they did. But Gavilar’s life work was to unite Alethkar, and I’ll go to Damnation before I let it break apart.”</p>
<p class="para">“Father,” Adolin said, feeling pained, “if there’s something wrong here, it’s that we’re not trying hard enough. You think the highprinces are playing games? Well, show them the way it should be done! Instead of talking of retreat, we should be talking of advancing, striking at the Parshendi instead of besieging them.”</p>
<p class="para">“Perhaps.”</p>
<p class="para">“Either way, we cannot speak of withdrawing,” Adolin said. The men <span class="italic1">already</span> talked of Dalinar losing his spine. What would they say if they got hold of this? “You haven’t brought this up with the king, have you?”</p>
<p class="para">“Not yet. I haven’t found the right way.”</p>
<p class="para">“Please. Don’t talk to him about it.”</p>
<p class="para">“We shall see.” Dalinar turned back toward the Shattered Plains, his eyes growing distant again.</p>
<p class="para">“Father…”</p>
<p class="para">“You’ve made your point, son, and I’ve replied to it. Do not press the issue. Have you gotten the report from the rear guard?”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="para">“What of the vanguard?”</p>
<p class="para">“I just checked with them and…” He trailed off. Blast. It had been long enough that it was probably time to move the king’s party onward. The last of the army couldn’t leave this plateau until the king was safely on the other side.</p>
<p class="para">Adolin sighed and went off to collect the report. Before long, they were all across the chasm and riding over the next plateau. Renarin trotted up to Adolin and tried to engage him in conversation, but Adolin gave only halfhearted replies.</p>
<p class="para">He was beginning to feel an odd longing. Most of the older men in the army—even those only a few years older than Adolin—had fought alongside his father during the glory days. Adolin found himself jealous of all of those men who had known his father and had seen him fight when he hadn’t been so wrapped up in the Codes.</p>
<p class="para">The changes in Dalinar had begun with the death of his brother. That terrible day was when everything had started to go wrong. The loss of Gavilar had nearly crushed Dalinar, and Adolin would <span class="italic1">never</span> forgive the Parshendi for bringing his father such pain. Never. Men fought on the Plains for different reasons, but this was why Adolin had come. Perhaps if they beat the Parshendi, his father would go back to the man he had been. Perhaps those ghostly delusions that haunted him would vanish.</p>

<p class="para">Ahead, Dalinar was speaking quietly with Sadeas. Both men wore frowns. They barely tolerated one another, though they had once been friends. That had also changed the night of Gavilar’s death. What had happened between them?</p>
<p class="para">The day wore on, and they eventually arrived at the hunt site—a pair of plateaus, one where the creature would be lured up to attack, and another one a safe distance away for those who would watch. Like most others, these plateaus had an uneven surface inhabited by hardy plants adapted to regular storm exposure. Rocky shelves, depressions, and uneven footing made fighting on them treacherous.</p>
<p class="para">Adolin joined his father, who waited beside the final bridge as the king moved over onto the viewing plateau, followed by a company of soldiers. The attendants would be next.</p>
<p class="para">“You’re doing well with your command, son,” Dalinar said, nodding to a group of soldiers as they passed and saluted.</p>
<p class="para">“They’re good men, Father. They hardly need someone to command them during a march from plateau to plateau.”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes,” Dalinar said. “But you need experience leading, and they need to learn to see you as a commander.” Renarin trotted up to them on his horse; it was probably time to cross to the viewing plateau. Dalinar nodded for his sons to go first.</p>
<p class="para">Adolin turned to go, but hesitated as he noticed something on the plateau behind them. A rider, moving quickly to catch up with the hunting party, coming from the direction of the warcamps.</p>
<p class="para">“Father,” Adolin said, pointing.</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar turned immediately, following the gesture. However, Adolin soon recognized the newcomer. Not a messenger, as he’d expected.</p>
<p class="para">“Wit!” Adolin called, waving.</p>
<p class="para">The newcomer trotted up to them. Tall and thin, the King’s Wit rode easily on a black gelding. He wore a stiff black coat and black trousers, a color matched by his deep onyx hair. Though he wore a long, thin sword tied to his waist, as far as Adolin knew, the man had never drawn it. A dueling foil rather than a military blade, it was mostly symbolic.</p>
<p class="para">Wit nodded to them as he approached, wearing one of those keen smiles of his. He had blue eyes, but he wasn’t really a lighteyes. Nor was he a darkeyes. He was…well, he was the King’s Wit. That was a category all its own.</p>
<p class="para">“Ah, young Prince Adolin!” Wit exclaimed. “You actually managed to pry yourself away from the camp’s young women long enough to join this hunt? I’m impressed.”</p>
<p class="para">Adolin chuckled uncomfortably. “Well, that’s been a topic of some discussion lately….”</p>
<p class="para">Wit raised an eyebrow.</p>

<p class="para">Adolin sighed. Wit would find out eventually anyway—it was virtually impossible to keep anything from the man. “I made a lunch appointment with one woman yesterday, but I was…well, I was courting another. And she’s the jealous type. So now neither will speak with me.”</p>
<p class="para">“It’s a constant source of amazement that you get yourself into such messes, Adolin. Each one is more exciting than the previous!”</p>
<p class="para">“Er, yes. Exciting. That’s <span class="italic1">exactly</span> how it feels.”</p>
<p class="para">Wit laughed again, though he maintained a sense of dignity in his posture. The King’s Wit was not a silly court fool such as one might find in other kingdoms. He was a sword, a tool maintained by the king. Insulting others was beneath the dignity of the king, so just as one used gloves when forced to handle something vile, the king retained a Wit so he didn’t have to debase himself to the level of rudeness or offensiveness.</p>
<p class="para">This new Wit had been with them for some months, and there was something…different about him. He seemed to know things that he shouldn’t, important things. Useful things.</p>
<p class="para">Wit nodded to Dalinar. “Your Lordship.”</p>
<p class="para">“Wit,” Dalinar said stiffly.</p>
<p class="para">“And young Prince Renarin!”</p>
<p class="para">Renarin kept his eyes down.</p>
<p class="para">“No greeting for me, Renarin?” Wit said, amused.</p>
<p class="para">Renarin said nothing.</p>
<p class="para">“He thinks you’ll mock him if he speaks to you, Wit,” Adolin said. “Earlier this morning, he told me he’d determined not to say anything around you.”</p>
<p class="para">“Wonderful!” Wit exclaimed. “Then I can say whatever I wish, and he’ll not object?”</p>
<p class="para">Renarin hesitated.</p>
<p class="para">Wit leaned in to Adolin. “Have I told you about the night Prince Renarin and I had two days back, walking the streets of the warcamp? We came across these two sisters, you see, blue eyed and—”</p>
<p class="para">“That’s a lie!” Renarin said, blushing.</p>
<p class="para">“Very well,” Wit said without missing a beat, “I’ll confess there were actually <span class="italic1">three</span> sisters, but Prince Renarin quite unfairly ended up with two of them, and I didn’t wish to diminish my reputation by—”</p>
<p class="para">“Wit.” Dalinar was stern as he cut in.</p>
<p class="para">The black-clad man looked to him.</p>
<p class="para">“Perhaps you should restrict your mockery to those who deserve it.”</p>
<p class="para">“Brightlord Dalinar. I believe that was what I <span class="italic1">was</span> doing.”</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar’s frown deepened. He never had liked Wit, and picking on Renarin was a sure way to raise his ire. Adolin could understand that, but Wit was almost always good-natured with Renarin.</p>

<p class="para">Wit moved to leave, passing Dalinar as he did. Adolin could barely overhear what was said as Wit leaned over to whisper something. “Those who ‘deserve’ my mockery are those who can benefit from it, Brightlord Dalinar. That one is less fragile than you think him.” He winked, then turned his horse to move on over the bridge.</p>
<p class="para">“Stormwinds, but I like that man,” Adolin said. “Best Wit we’ve had in ages!”</p>
<p class="para">“I find him unnerving,” Renarin said softly.</p>
<p class="para">“That’s half the fun!”</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar said nothing. The three of them crossed the bridge, passing Wit, who had stopped to torment a group of officers—lighteyes of low enough rank that they needed to serve in the army and earn a wage. Several of them laughed while Wit poked fun at another.</p>
<p class="para">The three of them joined the king, and were immediately approached by the day’s huntmaster. Bashin was a short man with a sizable paunch; he wore rugged clothing with a leather overcoat and a wide-brimmed hat. He was a darkeyes of the first nahn, the highest and most prestigious rank a darkeyes could have, worthy even of marrying into a lighteyed family.</p>
<p class="para">Bashin bowed to the king. “Your Majesty! Wonderful timing! We’ve just tossed down the bait.”</p>
<p class="para">“Excellent,” Elhokar said, climbing from the saddle. Adolin and Dalinar did likewise, Shardplate clinking softly, Dalinar untying his helm from the saddle. “How long will it take?”</p>
<p class="para">“Two or three hours is likely,” Bashin said, taking the reins of the king’s horse. Grooms took the two Ryshadium. “We’ve set up over there.”</p>
<p class="para">Bashin pointed toward the hunting plateau, the smaller plateau where the actual fighting would take place away from the attendants and the bulk of the soldiers. A group of hunters led a lumbering chull around its perimeter, towing a rope draped over the side of the cliff. That rope would be dragging the bait.</p>
<p class="para">“We’re using hog carcasses,” Bashin explained. “And we poured hog’s blood over the sides. The chasmfiend has been spotted by patrols here a good dozen times. He’s got his nest nearby, for certain—he’s not here to pupate. He’s too big for that, and he’s remained in the area too long. So it should be a fine hunt! Once he arrives, we’ll loose a group of wild hogs as distractions, and you can begin weakening him with arrows.”</p>
<p class="para">They had brought grandbows: large steel bows with thick strings and such a high draw weight that only a Shardbearer could use them, to fire shafts as thick as three fingers. They were recent creations, devised by Alethi engineers through the use of fabrial science, and each required a small infused gemstone to maintain the strength of its pull without warping the metal. Adolin’s aunt Navani—the widow of King Gavilar, mother of Elhokar and his sister Jasnah—had led the research to develop the bows.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">It would be nice if she hadn’t left,</span> Adolin thought idly. Navani was an interesting woman. Things were never boring around her.</p>
<p class="para">Some had started calling the bows Shardbows, but Adolin didn’t like the term. Shardblades and Shardplate were something special. Relics from another time, a time when the Radiants had walked Roshar. No amount of fabrial science had even approached re-creating them.</p>
<p class="para">Bashin led the king and his highprinces toward a pavilion at the center of the viewing plateau. Adolin joined his father, intending to give a report on the crossing. About half of the soldiers were in place, but many of the attendants were still making their way across the large, permanent bridge onto the viewing plateau. The king’s banner flapped above the pavilion, and a small refreshment station had been erected. A soldier at the back was setting up the rack of four grandbows. They were sleek and dangerous-looking, with thick black shafts in four quivers beside them.</p>
<p class="para">“I think you’ll have a fine day for the hunt,” Bashin said to Dalinar. “Judging by reports, the beast is a big one. Larger than you’ve ever slain before, Brightlord.”</p>
<p class="para">“Gavilar always wanted to slay one of these,” Dalinar said wistfully. “He loved greatshell hunts, though he never got a chasmfiend. Odd that I’ve now killed so many.”</p>
<p class="para">The chull pulling the bait bleated in the distance.</p>
<p class="para">“You need to go for the legs on this one, Brightlords,” Bashin said. Pre-hunt advice was one of Bashin’s responsibilities, and he took those seriously. “Chasmfiends, well, you’re used to attacking them in their chrysalises. Don’t forget how mean they are when they’re not pupating. With one this big, use a distraction and come in from…” He trailed off, then groaned, cursing softly. “Storms take that animal. I swear, the man who trained it must have been daft.”</p>
<p class="para">He was looking across at the next plateau. Adolin followed his glance. The crablike chull that had been towing the bait was lumbering away from the chasm with a slow, yet determined gait. Its handlers were yelling, running after it.</p>
<p class="para">“I’m sorry, Brightlord,” Bashin said. “It’s been doing this all day.”</p>
<p class="para">The chull bleated in a gravelly voice. Something seemed wrong to Adolin.</p>
<p class="para">“We can send for another one,” Elhokar said. “It shouldn’t take too long to—”</p>
<p class="para">“Bashin?” Dalinar said, his voice suddenly alarmed. “Shouldn’t there be <span class="italic1">bait</span> on the end of that beast’s rope?”</p>
<p class="para">The huntmaster froze. The rope the chull was towing was frayed at the end.</p>

<p class="para">Something dark—something mind-numbingly enormous—rose out of the chasm on thick, chitinous legs. It climbed onto the plateau—not the small plateau where the hunt was supposed to take place, but the viewing plateau where Dalinar and Adolin stood. The plateau filled with attendants, unarmed guests, female scribes, and unprepared soldiers.</p>
<p class="para">“Aw, Damnation,” Bashin said.</p>
