<div class="subtitle-chapter"><span class="calibre2"><span class="calibre18">To the Tower of Ghenjei</span></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">W</span>ith night so near, they had no choice but to camp there on the mountain near the Waygate. In two camps. Faile insisted on it.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“That is done with,” Loial told her in a displeased rumble. “We are out of the Ways, and I have kept my oath. It is finished.” Faile put on one of her stubborn expressions, with chin up and fists on hips.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Leave it alone, Loial,” Perrin said. “I’ll camp over there a bit.” Loial glanced at Faile, who had turned to the two Aiel women as soon as she heard Perrin agree, then shook his huge head and made as if to join Perrin and Gaul. Perrin motioned him back, with a small gesture he hoped none of the women noticed.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He made it a small bit, less than twenty paces. The Waygate might be locked, but there were still the ravens, and whatever they might presage. He wanted to be near if needed. If Faile complained, she could just complain. He was so set to ignore her protests that it irked him when she made none.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Disregarding twinges from his leg and side, he unsaddled Stepper and unloaded the packhorse, hobbled both animals and fitted them with nose bags with a few handfuls of barley and some oats. There was certainly no grazing up here. As to what there was, though . . . . He strung his bow and laid it across his quiver near the fire, slipped the axe free of its belt loop.
</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Gaul joined him in making a fire, and they had a meal of bread and cheese and dried beef, eaten in silence and washed down with water. The sun slid behind the mountains, silhouetting the peaks and painting the undersides of the clouds red. Shadows blanketed the valley, and the air began to grow crisp.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Dusting crumbs from his hands, Perrin dug his good green wool cloak out of his saddlebags. Perhaps he had grown more accustomed to Tear’s heat than he had thought. The women were certainly not eating in silence around their shadow-shrouded fire; he could hear them laughing, and the bits of what they said that he picked up made his ears burn. Women would talk about anything; they had no restraint at all. Loial had moved as far away from them as he could and still be in the light, and was trying to bury himself in a book. They probably did not even realize they were embarrassing the Ogier; they probably thought they were talking quietly enough for Loial not to hear.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Muttering to himself, Perrin sat back down across the fire from Gaul. The Aiel seemed to be taking no notice of the chill. “Do you know any funny stories?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Funny stories? I cannot think of one, offhand.” Gaul’s eyes half-turned to the other fire, and the laughter. “I would if I could. The sun, remember?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin laughed noisily and made his voice loud enough to carry. “I do. Women!” The hilarity in the other camp faded for a moment before rising again. That should show them. Other people could laugh. Perrin stared glumly into the fire. His wounds ached.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">After a moment, Gaul said, “This place begins to look more like the Three-fold Land than most of the wetlands. Too much water, still, and the trees are still too big and too many, but it is not so strange as the places called forests.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The soil was poor here where Manetheren had died in fire, the widely scattered trees all stunted and thick-boled, odd wind-bent shapes, none as much as thirty feet high. Perrin thought it about as desolate a spot as he had ever seen.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I wish I could see your Three-fold Land someday, Gaul.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Perhaps you will, when we are done here.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Perhaps.” Not much chance of it, of course. None, really. He could have told the Aielman that, but he did not want to talk of it now, or think of it.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“This is where Manetheren stood? You are of Manetheren’s blood?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“This was Manetheren,” Perrin replied. “And I suppose I am.” It was hard to believe that the small villages and quiet farms of the Two Rivers held the last of Manetheren’s blood, but that was what Moiraine had said. The old blood runs strong in the Two Rivers, she had said. “That was a long time ago, Gaul. We are farmers, shepherds; not a great nation, not great warriors.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Gaul smiled slightly. “If you say it. I have seen you dance the spears, and Rand al’Thor, and the one called Mat. But if you say it.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin shifted uncomfortably. How much had he changed since leaving home? Himself, and Rand, and Mat? Not his eyes, and the wolves, or Rand’s channeling; he did not mean that. How much of what was inside remained unchanged? Mat was the only one who still seemed to be just himself, only more so. “You know about Manetheren?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We know more of your world than you think. And less than we believed. Long before I crossed the Dragonwall I had read books brought by peddlers. I knew of  ‘ships’ and  ‘rivers’ and  ‘forests,’ or thought I did.” Gaul made them sound like words in a strange tongue. “This is how I envisioned a  ‘forest.’ ” He gestured at the sparse trees, dwarfed from the height they should have had. “To believe a thing is not to make it true. What of the Nightrunner, and Leafblighter’s get? Do you believe it just coincidence they came near this Waygate?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“No.” Perrin sighed. “I saw ravens, down the valley. Maybe that’s all they were, but I don’t want to take the chance, not after the Trollocs.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Gaul nodded. “They could have been Shadoweyes. If you plan for the worst, all surprises are pleasant.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I could do with a pleasant surprise.” Perrin felt for wolves again, and again found nothing. “I may be able to find out something tonight. Maybe. If anything happens here, you might have to kick me to wake me.” That sounded odd, he realized, but Gaul only nodded again. “Gaul, you’ve never mentioned my eyes, or even given them a second glance. None of the Aiel have.” He knew they were glowing golden now, in the firelight.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The world is changing,” Gaul said quietly. “Rhuarc, and Jheran, my own clan chief—the Wise Ones, too—they tried to hide it, but they were uneasy when they sent us across the Dragonwall searching for He Who Comes With the Dawn. I think perhaps the change will not be what we have always believed. I do not know how it will be different, but it will be. The Creator put us in the Three-fold Land to shape us as well as to punish
our sin, but for what have we been shaped?” He shook his head suddenly, ruefully. “Colinda, the Wise One of Hot Springs Hold, tells me I think too much for a Stone Dog, and Bair, the eldest Wise One of the Shaarad, threatens to send me to Rhuidean when Jheran dies whether I want to go or not. Beside all of that, Perrin, what does the color of a man’s eyes matter?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I wish everybody thought that way.” The merriment had finally stopped at the other fire. One of the Aiel women—Perrin could not tell which—was taking the first watch, her back to the light, and everyone else had settled down for sleep. It had been a tiring day. Sleep should be easy to find, and the dream he needed. He stretched out beside the fire, pulling his cloak around him. “Remember. Kick me awake, if need be.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Sleep enfolded him while Gaul was still nodding, and the dream came at once.</span></div>
<div class="p-blanc"><span class="calibre22"> <br class="calibre8"/></span></div>
<div class="p-blanc"><span class="calibre22"> <br class="calibre8"/></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="calibre22">It was daylight, and he stood alone near the Waygate, which looked like an elegantly carved length of wall, incongruous on the mountainside. Except for that there was no sign any human had ever set foot on that slope. The sky was bright and fine, and a soft breeze up the valley brought him the scent of deer and rabbits, quail and dove, a thousand distinct smells, of water and earth and trees. This was the wolf dream.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">For a moment the sense of <span class="calibre18">being</span> a wolf rolled over him. He had paws, and . . . . <span class="calibre18">No!</span> He ran his hands over himself, relieved to find only his own body, in his own coat and cloak. And the wide belt that normally held his axe, but with the hammer haft thrust through the loop instead.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He frowned at that, and surprisingly, for a moment, the axe flickered there instead, insubstantial and misty. Abruptly it was the hammer again. Licking his lips, he hoped it stayed that way. The axe might be a better weapon, but he preferred the hammer. He could not remember anything like that happening before, something changing, but he knew little of this strange place. If it could be called a place. It was the wolf dream, and odd things happened there, surely as odd as in any ordinary dream.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">As though thinking of the oddities triggered one of them, a patch of sky against the mountains darkened suddenly, became a window to somewhere else. Rand stood amid swirling stormwinds, laughing wildly, even madly, arms upraised, and on the winds rode small shapes, gold-and-scarlet, like the strange figure on the Dragon banner; hidden eyes watched Rand, and there was no telling whether he knew it. The odd “window”
winked out, only to be replaced by another farther over, where Nynaeve and Elayne stalked cautiously through a demented landscape of twisted, shadowed buildings, hunting some dangerous beast. Perrin could not have said how he knew it was dangerous, but he did. That vanished, and another black blotch spread across the sky. Mat, standing where a road forked ahead of him. He flipped a coin, started down one branch, and suddenly was wearing a wide-brimmed hat and walking with a staff bearing a short sword blade. Another “window,” and Egwene and a woman with long white hair were staring at him in surprise while behind them the White Tower crumbled stone by stone. Then they were gone, too.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin drew a deep breath. He had seen the like before, here in the wolf dream, and he thought the sightings were real in some way, or meant something. Whatever they were, the wolves never saw them. Moiraine had suggested that the wolf dream was the same as something called <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span>, and then would say no more. He had overheard Egwene and Elayne speaking of dreams, once, but Egwene already knew too much about him and wolves, perhaps as much as Moiraine. It was not something he could talk about, not even with her.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">There was one person he could have talked to. He wished he could find Elyas Machera, the man who had introduced him to the wolves. Elyas had to know about these things. When he thought of the man, it seemed for a moment he heard his own name whispered faintly in the wind, but when he listened, there was only the wind. It was a lonely sound. Here there was only himself.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Hopper!” he called, and in his mind, <span class="calibre18">Hopper</span>! The wolf was dead, and yet not dead, here. The wolf dream was where wolves came when they died, to await being born again. It was more than that, to wolves; they seemed in some way to be aware of the dream even while awake. One was almost as real—maybe as real—as the other, to them. “Hopper!” <span class="calibre18">Hopper!</span> But Hopper did not come.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">This was all useless. He was there for a reason, and he might as well get on with it. At best, getting down to where he had seen the ravens rise would take hours.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He took a step—the land around him blurred—and his foot came down near a narrow brook beneath stunted hemlock and mountain willow, with cloud-capped peaks towering above. For a moment he stared in amazement. He was at the far end of the valley from the Waygate. In fact, he was at the very spot he had been aiming for, the place where the ravens had come from, and the arrow that killed the first hawk. Such a thing had never
happened to him before. Was he learning more of the wolf dream—Hopper had always said he was ignorant—or was it different this time?</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He was more cautious with his next step, but it was only a step. There was no evidence of archer or ravens, no track, no feather, no scent. He was not sure what he had expected. There would be no sign unless they had been in the dream, too. But if he could find wolves in the dream, they could help him find their brothers and sisters in the waking world, and those wolves could tell him if there were Shadowspawn in the mountains. Perhaps if he were higher up they could hear him call.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Fixing his eye on the highest peak bordering the valley, just below the clouds, he stepped. The world blurred, and he was standing on the mountainside, with white billows not five spans overhead. In spite of himself, he laughed. This was fun. From here he could see the entire valley stretched out below.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Hopper!” No answer.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He leaped to the next mountain, calling, and the next, and the next, eastward, toward the Two Rivers. Hopper did not answer. More troubling, Perrin did not sense any other wolves, either. There were always wolves in the wolf dream. Always.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">From peak to peak he sped in blurred motion, calling, seeking. The mountains lay empty beneath him, except for deer and other game. Yet there were occasional signs of men. Ancient signs. Twice great carved figures took nearly an entire mountainside, and in another place strange angular letters two spans high had been incised across a cliff a shade too smooth and sheer. Weathering had worn away the figures’ faces, and eyes less sharp than his might have taken the letters themselves for the work of wind and rain. Mountains and cliffs gave way to the Sand Hills, great rolling mounds sparsely covered with tough grass and stubborn bushes, once the shore of a great sea before the Breaking. And suddenly he saw another man, atop a sandy hill.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The fellow was too distant to see clearly, just a tall, dark-haired man, but plainly not a Trolloc or anything of the sort, in a blue coat with a bow on his back, stooping over something on the ground hidden by the low brush. Yet there was something familiar about him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The wind rose, and Perrin caught his smell faintly. A cold scent, that was the only way to describe it. Cold, and not really human. Suddenly his own bow was in his hand, an arrow nocked, and the weight of a filled quiver tugged at his belt.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The other man looked up, saw Perrin. For a heartbeat he hesitated, then turned and became a streak, slashing away across the hills.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin leaped down to where he had stood, stared at what had occupied the fellow, and without thought pursued, leaving the half-skinned corpse of a wolf behind. A dead wolf in the wolf dream. It was unthinkable. What could kill a wolf here? Something evil.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">His prey ran ahead of him in strides that covered miles, never more than barely in sight. Out of the hills and across the tangled Westwood with its wide-scattered farms, over cleared farmland, a quilt of hedged fields and small thickets, and past Watch Hill. It was odd to see the thatched village houses covering the hill with no people in the streets, and farmhouses standing as if abandoned. But he kept his eye on the man fleeing ahead of him. He had become so used to this pursuit that he felt no surprise when one leaping stride put him down on the south bank of the River Taren and the next amid barren hills without trees or grass. North and east he ran, over streams and roads and villages and rivers, intent only on the man ahead. The land grew flat and grassy, broken by scattered thickets, without any sign of man. Then something glittered ahead, sparkling in the sun, a tower of metal. His quarry sped straight for it, and vanished. Two leaps brought Perrin there as well.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Two hundred feet the tower rose, and forty thick, gleaming like burnished steel. It might as well have been a solid column of metal. Perrin walked around it twice without seeing any opening, not so much as a crack, not even a mark on that smooth, sheer wall. The smell hung here, though, that cold, inhuman stink. The trail ended here. The man—if man he was—had gone inside somehow. He only had to find the way to follow.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">Stop!</span> It was a raw flow of emotion that Perrin’s mind put a word to. <span class="calibre18">Stop!</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He turned as a great gray wolf as tall as his waist, grizzled and scarred, alighted as if he had just leaped down from the sky. He might well have. Hopper had always envied eagles their ability to fly, and here, he could too. Yellow eyes met yellow eyes.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Why should I stop, Hopper? He killed a wolf.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">Men have killed wolves, and wolves men. Why does anger seize your throat like fire this time?</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I don’t know,” Perrin said slowly. “Maybe because it was here. I didn’t know it was possible to kill a wolf here. I thought wolves were safe in the dream.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">You chase Slayer, Young Bull. He is here in the flesh, and he can kill.</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“In the flesh? You mean not just dreaming? How can he be here in the flesh?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">I do not know. It is a thing dimly remembered from long ago, come again as so much else. Things of the Shadow walk the dream, now. Creatures of Heartfang. There is no safety.</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Well, he’s inside, now.” Perrin studied the featureless metal tower. “If I can find how he got in, I can put an end to him.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">Cub foolish, digging in a groundwasps’ nest. This place is evil. All know this. And you would chase evil into evil. Slayer can kill.</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin paused. There was a sense of finality to the emotions his mind attached the word “kill” to. “Hopper, what happens to a wolf who dies in the dream?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The wolf was silent for a time. <span class="calibre18">If we die here, we die forever, Young Bull. I do not know if the same is true for you, but I believe it is.</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“A dangerous place, archer. The Tower of Ghenjei is a bad place for humankind.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin whirled, half-raising his bow before he saw the woman standing a few paces away, her golden hair in a thick braid to her waist, almost the way women wore it in the Two Rivers, but more intricately woven. Her clothes were oddly cut, a short white coat and voluminous trousers of some thin pale yellow material gathered at the ankles above short boots. Her dark cloak seemed to hide something that glinted silver at her side.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She shifted, and the metallic flicker vanished. “You have sharp eyes, archer. I thought that the first time I saw you.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">How long had she been watching? It was embarrassing that she had sneaked up without him hearing. At the least Hopper should have warned him. The wolf was lying down in the knee-high grass, muzzle on his forepaws, watching him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The woman seemed vaguely familiar, though Perrin was certain he would have remembered her had he ever seen her before. Who was she, to be in the wolf dream? Or was it Moiraine’s <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span>, too? “Are you Aes Sedai?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“No, archer.” She laughed. “I only came to warn you, despite the prescripts. Once entered, the Tower of Ghenjei is hard enough to leave in the world of men. Here it is all but impossible. You have a bannerman’s courage, which some say cannot be told from foolhardiness.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Impossible to leave? The fellow—Slayer—surely had gone in. Why
would he do that if he could not leave? “Hopper said it’s dangerous, too. The Tower of Ghenjei? What is it?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Her eyes widened, and she glanced at Hopper, who still lay stretched out on the grass ignoring her and watching Perrin. “You can talk to wolves? Now that is a thing long lost in legend. So that is how you are here. I should have known. The tower? It is a doorway, archer, to the realms of the Aelfinn and the Eelfinn.” She said the names as if he should recognize them. When he looked at her blankly, she said, “Did you ever play the game called Snakes and Foxes?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“All children do. At least, they do in the Two Rivers. But they give it up when they get old enough to realize there’s no way to win.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Except to break the rules,” she said. “ ‘Courage to strengthen, fire to blind, music to daze, iron to bind.’ ”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“That’s a line from the game. I don’t understand. What does it have to do with this tower?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Those are the ways to win against the snakes and the foxes. The game is a remembrance of old dealings. It does not matter so long as you stay away from the Aelfinn and the Eelfinn. They are not evil the way the Shadow is evil, yet they are so different from humankind they might as well be. They are not to be trusted, archer. Stay clear of the Tower of Ghenjei. Avoid the World of Dreams, if you can. Dark things walk.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Like the man I was chasing? Slayer.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“A good name for him. This Slayer is not old, archer, but his evil is ancient.” She almost appeared to be leaning slightly on something invisible; perhaps that silver thing he had never quite seen. “I seem to be telling you a great deal. I do not understand why I spoke in the first place. Of course. Are you <span class="calibre18">ta’veren</span>, archer?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Who are you?” She seemed to know a lot about the tower, and the wolf dream. <span class="calibre18">But she was surprised I could talk to Hopper.</span> “I’ve met you before somewhere, I think.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I have broken too many of the prescripts already, archer.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Prescripts? What prescripts?” A shadow fell on the ground behind Hopper, and Perrin turned quickly, angry at being caught by surprise again. There was no one there. But he had seen it; the shadow of a man with the hilts of two swords rising above his shoulders. Something about that image teased his memory.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He is right,” the woman said behind him. “I should not be talking to you.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">When he turned back, she was gone. As far as he could see were only grassland and scattered thickets. And the gleaming, silvery tower.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He frowned at Hopper, who finally lifted his head from his paws. “It’s a wonder you aren’t attacked by chipmunks,” Perrin muttered. “What did you make of her?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">Her? A she?</span> Hopper stood, looking around. <span class="calibre18">Where?</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I was talking to her. Right here. Just now.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">You made noises at the wind, Young Bull. There was no she here. None but you and I.</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin scratched his beard irritably. She had been there. He had not been talking to himself. “Strange things can happen here,” he told himself. “She agreed with you, Hopper. She told me to stay away from this tower.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">She is wise.</span> There was an element of doubt in the thought; Hopper still did not believe there had been any “she.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I’ve come awfully far afield from what I intended,” Perrin muttered. He explained his need to find wolves in the Two Rivers, or the mountains above, explained about the ravens, and the Trollocs in the Ways.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">When he was done, Hopper remained silent for a long time, his bushy tail held low and stiff. Finally . . . . <span class="calibre18">Avoid your old home, Young Bull.</span> The image Perrin’s mind called “home” was of the land marked by a wolfpack. <span class="calibre18">There are no wolves there now. Those who were and did not flee are dead. Slayer walks the dream there.</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I have to go home, Hopper. I have to.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">Take care, Young Bull. The day of the Last Hunt draws near. We will run together in the Last Hunt.</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We will,” Perrin said sadly. It would be nice if he could come here when he died; he was half wolf already, it seemed sometimes. “I have to go now, Hopper.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">May you know good hunting, Young Bull, and shes to give you many cubs.</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Goodbye, Hopper.”</span></div>
<div class="p-blanc"><span class="calibre22"> <br class="calibre8"/></span></div>
