<p class="extractLetterSalutation"><span class="italic1">I realize that you are probably still angry. That is pleasant to know. Much as your perpetual health, I have come to rely upon your dissatisfaction with me. It is one of the cosmere’s great constants, I should think.</span></p></div></div>
<div class="calibre8">
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Ten heartbeats.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">One.</span></p>
<p class="para">That was how long it took to summon a Shardblade. If Dalinar’s heart was racing, the time was shorter. If he was relaxed, it took longer.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Two.</span></p>
<p class="para">On the battlefield, the passing of those beats could stretch like an eternity. He pulled his helm on as he ran.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Three.</span></p>
<p class="para">The chasmfiend slammed an arm down, smashing the bridge filled with attendants and soldiers. People screamed, plunging into the chasm. Dalinar dashed forward on Plate-enhanced legs, following the king.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Four.</span></p>
<p class="para">The chasmfiend towered like a mountain of interlocking carapace the color of dark violet ink. Dalinar could see why the Parshendi called these things gods. It had a twisted, arrowhead-like face, with a mouth full of barbed mandibles. While it was vaguely crustacean, this was no bulky, placid chull. It had four wicked foreclaws set into broad shoulders, each claw the size of a horse, and a dozen smaller legs that clutched the side of the plateau.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Five.</span></p>
<p class="para">Chitin made a grinding noise against stone as the creature finished pulling itself onto the plateau, snatching a cart-pulling chull with a swift claw.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Six.</span></p>
<p class="para">“To arms, to arms!” Elhokar bellowed ahead of Dalinar. “Archers, fire!”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Seven.</span></p>
<p class="para">“Distract it from the unarmed!” Dalinar bellowed at his soldiers.</p>
<p class="para">The creature cracked the chull’s shell—platter-size fragments clattering to the plateau—then stuffed the beast into its maw and began looking down at the fleeing scribes and attendants. The chull stopped bleating as the monster crunched down.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Eight.</span></p>
<p class="para">Dalinar leaped a rocky shelf and sailed five yards before slamming into the ground, throwing up chips of rock.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Nine.</span></p>
<p class="para">The chasmfiend bellowed with an awful screeching sound. It trumpeted with four voices, overlapping one another.</p>
<p class="para">Archers drew. Elhokar yelled orders just in front of Dalinar, his blue cape flapping.</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar’s hand tingled with anticipation.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Ten!</span></p>
<p class="para">His Shardblade—Oathbringer—formed in his hand, coalescing from mist, appearing as the tenth beat of his heart thudded in his chest. Six feet long from tip to hilt, the Blade would have been unwieldy in the hands of any man not wearing Shardplate. To Dalinar, it felt perfect. He’d carried Oathbringer since his youth, Bonding to it when he was twenty Weepings old. It was long and slightly curved, a handspan wide, with wavelike serrations near the hilt. It curved at the tip like a fisherman’s hook, and was wet with cold dew.</p>
<p class="para">This sword was a part of him. He could sense energy racing along its blade, as if it were eager. A man never really knew life itself until he charged into battle with Plate and Blade.</p>
<p class="para">“Make it <span class="italic1">angry</span>!” Elhokar bellowed, his Shardblade—Sunraiser—springing from mist into his hand. It was long and thin with a large crossguard, and was etched up the sides with the ten fundamental glyphs. He didn’t want the monster to escape; Dalinar could hear it in his voice. Dalinar was more worried about the soldiers and attendants; this hunt had already turned terribly wrong. Perhaps they should distract the monster long enough for everyone to escape, then pull back and let it dine on chulls and hogs.</p>
<p class="para">The creature screamed its multivoiced wail again, slamming a claw down among the soldiers. Men screamed; bones splintered and bodies crumpled.</p>
<p class="para">Archers loosed, aiming for the head. A hundred shafts zipped into the air, but only a few hit the soft muscle between plates of chitin. Behind them, Sadeas was calling for his grandbow. Dalinar couldn’t wait for that—the creature was here, dangerous, killing his men. The bow would be too slow. This was a job for the Blade.</p>
<p class="para">Adolin charged past, riding Sureblood. The lad had gone racing for his horse, rather than charging like Elhokar had. Dalinar himself had been forced to stay with the king. The other horses—even the warhorses—panicked, but Adolin’s white Ryshadium stallion held steady. In a moment, Gallant was there, trotting beside Dalinar. Dalinar grabbed the reins and heaved himself into the air with Plate-enhanced legs, jumping up into the saddle. The force of his landing might have strained the back of a regular horse, but Gallant was made of stronger stone than that.</p>
<p class="para">Elhokar closed his helm, the sides misting.</p>
<p class="para">“Hold back, Your Majesty,” Dalinar called, riding past. “Wait until Adolin and I weaken it.” Dalinar reached up, slamming down his own visor. The sides misted, locking it into place, and the sides of the helm became translucent to him. You still needed the eye slit—looking through the sides was like looking through dirty glass—but the translucence was one of the most wonderful parts of Shardplate.</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar rode into the monster’s shadow. Soldiers scrambled about, clutching spears. They hadn’t been trained to fight thirty-foot-tall beasts, and it was a testament to their valor that they formed up anyway, trying to draw attention away from the archers and the fleeing attendants.</p>
<p class="para">Arrows rained down, bouncing off the carapace and becoming more deadly to the troops below than they were to the chasmfiend. Dalinar raised his free arm to shade his eye slit as an arrow clanged off his helm.</p>
<p class="para">Adolin fell back as the beast swung at a batch of archers, crushing them with one of its claws. “I’ll take left,” Adolin yelled, voice muffled by his helm.</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar nodded, cutting to the right, galloping past a group of dazed soldiers and into sunlight again as the chasmfiend raised a foreclaw for another sweep. Dalinar raced under the limb, transferring Oathbringer to his left hand and holding the sword out to the side, slashing it through one of the chasmfiend’s trunklike legs.</p>
<p class="para">The Blade sheared the thick chitin with barely a tug of resistance. As always, it didn’t cut living flesh, though it killed the leg as surely as if it had been cut free. The large limb slipped, falling numb and useless.</p>
<p class="para">The monster roared with its deep, overlapping, trumpeting voices. On the other side, Dalinar could make out Adolin slicing at a leg.</p>
<p class="para">The creature shook, turning toward Dalinar. The two legs that had been cut dragged lifelessly. The monster was long and narrow like a cray-fish, and had a flattened tail. It walked on fourteen legs. How many could it lose before collapsing?</p>

<p class="para">Dalinar rounded Gallant, meeting up with Adolin, whose blue Shardplate was gleaming, cape streaming behind him. They switched sides as they turned in wide arcs, each heading for another leg.</p>
<p class="para">“Meet your enemy, monster!” Elhokar bellowed.</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar turned. The king had found his mount and had managed to get it under control. Vengeance wasn’t a Ryshadium, but the animal was of the best Shin stock. Astride the animal, Elhokar charged, Blade held above his head.</p>
<p class="para">Well, there was no forbidding him the fight. He should be all right in his Plate so long as he kept moving. “The legs, Elhokar!” Dalinar shouted.</p>
<p class="para">Elhokar ignored him, charging directly for the beast’s chest. Dalinar cursed, heeling Gallant as the monster swung. Elhokar turned at the last moment, leaning low, ducking under the blow. The chasmfiend’s claw hit stone with a cracking sound. It roared in anger at missing Elhokar, the sound echoing through the chasms.</p>
<p class="para">The king veered toward Dalinar, riding past him in a rush. “I’m distracting it, you fool. Keep attacking!”</p>
<p class="para">“I have the Ryshadium!” Dalinar yelled back at him. “I’ll distract—I’m faster!”</p>
<p class="para">Elhokar ignored him again. Dalinar sighed. Elhokar, characteristically, could not be contained. Arguing would only cost more time and more lives, so Dalinar did as he’d been told. He rounded to the side for another approach, Gallant’s hooves beating against the stone ground. The king drew the monster’s direct attention, and Dalinar was able to ride in and slam his Blade through another leg.</p>
<p class="para">The beast emitted four overlapping screams and turned toward Dalinar. But as it did, Adolin rode past on the other side, cutting at another leg with a deft strike. The leg slumped, and arrows rained down as archers continued to fire.</p>
<p class="para">The creature shook, confused by the attacks coming from every side. It was getting weak, and Dalinar raised his arm, gesturing. The command ordered the rest of the foot soldiers to retreat toward the pavilion. Orders given, he slipped in and killed another leg. That meant five down. Perhaps it was time to let the beast limp away; killing it now wasn’t worth risking lives.</p>
<p class="para">He called to the king, who rode—Blade held out to the side—a short distance away. The king glanced at him, but obviously didn’t hear. As the chasmfiend loomed in the background, Elhokar wheeled Vengeance in a sharp right turn toward Dalinar.</p>
<p class="para">There was a soft <span class="italic1">snap</span>, and suddenly the king—and his saddle—went tumbling through the air. The horse’s quick turn had caused the saddle girth to break. A man in Shardplate was heavy and put a great strain on both his mount and saddle.</p>

<p class="para">Dalinar felt a spike of fear, and he reined in Gallant. Elhokar slammed to the ground, dropping his Shardblade. The weapon reverted to mist, vanishing. It was a protection from keeping a Blade from being taken by your enemies; they vanished unless you willed them to stay when releasing them.</p>
<p class="para">“Elhokar!” Dalinar bellowed. The king rolled, cape wrapping around his body, then came to rest. He lay dazed for a moment; the armor was cracked on one shoulder, leaking Stormlight. The Plate would have cushioned the fall. He’d be all right.</p>
<p class="para">Unless—</p>
<p class="para">A claw loomed above the king.</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar felt a moment of panic, turning Gallant to charge toward the king. He was going to be too slow! The beast would—</p>
<p class="para">An enormous arrow slammed into the chasmfiend’s head, cracking chitin. Purple gore spurted free, causing the beast to trump in agony. Dalinar twisted in the saddle.</p>
<p class="para">Sadeas stood in his red Plate, taking another massive arrow from an attendant. He drew, launching the thick bolt into the chasmfiend’s shoulder with a sharp crack.</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar raised Oathbringer in salute. Sadeas acknowledged, raising his bow. They were not friends, and they did not like one another.</p>
<p class="para">But they <span class="italic1">would</span> protect the king. That was the bond that united them.</p>
<p class="para">“Get to safety!” Dalinar yelled to the king as he charged past. Elhokar stumbled to his feet and nodded.</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar moved in. He <span class="italic1">had</span> to distract the beast long enough for Elhokar to get away. More of Sadeas’s arrows flew true, but the monster started to ignore them. Its sluggishness vanished, and its bleats became angry, wild, crazed. It was growing truly enraged.</p>
<p class="para">This was the most dangerous part; there would be no retreating now. It would follow them until it either killed them or was slain.</p>
<p class="para">A claw smashed to the ground just beside Gallant, throwing chips of stone into the air. Dalinar hunkered low, careful to keep his Shardblade out, and he cut free another leg. Adolin had done the same on the other side. Seven legs down, half of them. How long before the beast dropped? Normally, at this stage, they had launched several dozen arrows into the animal. It was difficult to guess what one would do without that prior softening—beside that, he’d never fought one this large before.</p>
<p class="para">He turned Gallant, trying to draw the creature’s attention. Hopefully, Elhokar had—</p>
<p class="para">“Are you a god!” Elhokar bellowed.</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar groaned, looking over his shoulder. The king had <span class="italic1">not</span> fled. He strode toward the beast, hand to the side.</p>

<p class="para">“I defy you, creature!” Elhokar screamed. “I claim your life! They will see their gods crushed, just as they will see their king dead at my feet! I <span class="italic1">defy</span> you!”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Damnation’s own fool!</span> Dalinar thought, rounding Gallant.</p>
<p class="para">Elhokar’s Shardblade reformed in his hands, and he charged toward the monster’s chest, his cracked shoulder leaking Stormlight. He got close and swung at the beast’s torso, cutting free a piece of chitin—like a person’s hair or nails, it could be cut by a Blade. Then Elhokar slammed his weapon into the monster’s breast, seeking its heart.</p>
<p class="para">The beast roared and shook, knocking Elhokar free. The king barely kept hold of his Blade. The beast spun. That movement, unfortunately, brought its tail at Dalinar. He cursed, yanking Gallant in a tight turn, but the tail came too quickly. It slammed into Gallant, and in a heartbeat Dalinar found himself rolling, Oathbringer tumbling from his fingers and slicing a gash in the stone ground before puffing to mist.</p>
<p class="para">“Father!” a distant voice yelled.</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar came to rest on the stones, dizzy. He raised his head to see Gallant stumbling to his feet. Blessedly, the horse hadn’t broken a leg, though the animal bled from scrapes and was favoring one leg.</p>
<p class="para">“Away!” Dalinar said. The command word would send the horse to safety. Unlike Elhokar, <span class="italic1">it</span> would obey.</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar climbed to his feet, unsteady. A scraping sound came from his left, and Dalinar spun just in time for the chasmfiend’s tail to take him in the chest, tossing him backward.</p>
<p class="para">Again the world lurched, and metal hit stone in a cacophony as he slid.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">No!</span> he thought, getting a gauntleted hand beneath himself and heaving, using the momentum of his slide to throw himself upright. As the sky spun, something seemed to <span class="italic1">right</span>, as if the Plate itself knew which way was up. He landed—still moving, feet grinding on stone.</p>
<p class="para">He got his balance, then charged toward the king, beginning the process of summoning his Shardblade again. Ten heartbeats. An eternity.</p>
<p class="para">The archers continued to fire, and more than a few of their shafts bristled form the chasmfiend’s face. It ignored them, though Sadeas’s larger arrows still seemed to distract it. Adolin had sheared through another leg, and the creature lumbered uncertainly, eight of its fourteen legs dragging uselessly.</p>
<p class="para">“Father!”</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar turned to see Renarin—dressed in a stiff blue Kholin uniform, with a long coat buttoning to the neck—riding across the rocky ground. “Father, are you well? Can I help?”</p>
<p class="para">“Fool boy!” Dalinar said, pointing. “Go!”</p>
<p class="para">“But—”</p>

<p class="para">“You’re unarmored and unarmed!” Dalinar bellowed. “Get back before you get yourself killed!”</p>
<p class="para">Renarin pulled his roan horse to a halt.</p>
<p class="para">“GO!”</p>
<p class="para">Renarin galloped away. Dalinar turned and ran toward Elhokar, Oathbringer misting into existence in his waiting hand. Elhokar continued to hack at the beast’s lower torso, and sections of flesh blackened and died when the Shardblade struck. If he rammed the Shardblade in just right, he could stop the heart or lungs, but that would be difficult while the beast was upright.</p>
<p class="para">Adolin—stalwart as always—had dismounted beside the king. He tried to stop the claws, striking at them as they fell. Unfortunately, there were four claws and only one of Adolin. Two swung at him at once, and though Adolin sliced a chunk out of one, he didn’t see the other sweeping at his back.</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar called out too late. Shardplate <span class="italic1">snapped</span> as the claw tossed Adolin into the air. He arced and hit in a tumble. His Plate didn’t shatter, thank the Heralds, but the breastplate and side cracked widely, leaking trails of white smoke.</p>
<p class="para">Adolin rolled lethargically, hands moving. He was alive.</p>
<p class="para">No time to think about him now. Elhokar was alone.</p>
<p class="para">The beast struck, pounding the ground beside the king, knocking him off his feet. His blade vanished and Elhokar fell face-first on the stones.</p>
<p class="para">Something changed inside of Dalinar. Reservations vanished. Other concerns became meaningless. His brother’s son was in danger.</p>
<p class="para">He had failed Gavilar, had lain drunk in his wine while his brother fought for his life. Dalinar should have been there to defend him. Only two things remained of his beloved brother, two things that Dalinar could protect in a hope to earn some form of redemption: Gavilar’s kingdom and Gavilar’s son.</p>
<p class="para">Elhokar was alone and in danger.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Nothing else mattered.</span></p>
<p class="centerImage3"><img src="../images/00656.jpeg" alt="image" class="epubimage12"/></p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Adolin shook his head, dazed. He slammed his visor up, taking a gasp of fresh air to clear his mind.</p>
<p class="para">Fighting. They were fighting. He could hear men screaming, rocks shaking, an enormous bleating sound. He smelled something moldy. Greatshell blood.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">The chasmfiend!</span> he thought. Before his mind was even clear, Adolin began summoning his Blade again and forced himself to his hands and knees.</p>

<p class="para">The monster loomed a short distance away, a dark shadow upon the sky. Adolin had fallen near its right side. As his vision lost its fuzziness, he saw that the king was down, and his armor was cracked from the blow he’d taken earlier.</p>
<p class="para">The chasmfiend raised a massive claw, preparing to slam it down. Adolin knew—suddenly—that disaster was upon them. The king would be killed on a simple hunt. The kingdom would shatter, the highprinces divided, the one tenuous link that kept them together cut away.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">No!</span> Adolin thought, stunned, still dazed, trying to stumble forward.</p>
<p class="para">And then he saw his father.</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar charged toward the king, moving with a speed and grace no man—not even one wearing Shardplate—should be able to manage. He leaped over a rock shelf, then ducked and skidded beneath a claw swinging for him. Other men thought they understood Shardblades and Shardplate, but Dalinar Kholin…at times, he proved them all children.</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar straightened and leaped—still moving forward—cresting by inches a second claw that smashed apart the rocky shelf behind him.</p>
<p class="para">It was all just a moment. A breath. The third claw was falling toward the king, and Dalinar roared, leaping forward. He dropped his Blade—it hit the ground and puffed away—as he skidded beneath the falling claw. He raised his hands and—</p>
<p class="para">And he caught it. He bent beneath the blow, going down on one knee, and the air rang with a resounding clang of carapace against armor.</p>
<p class="para">But he <span class="italic1">caught it</span>.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Stormfather!</span> Adolin thought, watching his father stand over the king, bowed beneath the enormous weight of a monster many times his size. Shocked archers hesitated. Sadeas lowered his grandbow. Adolin’s breath caught in his chest.</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar held back the claw and matched its strength, a figure in dark, silvery metal that almost seemed to glow. The beast trumpeted above, and Dalinar bellowed back a powerful, defiant yell.</p>
<p class="para">In that moment, Adolin knew he was seeing <span class="italic1">him</span>. The Blackthorn, the very man he’d been wishing he could fight alongside. The Plate of Dalinar’s gauntlets and shoulders began to crack, webs of light moving down the ancient metal. Adolin finally shook himself into motion. <span class="italic1">I have to help!</span></p>
<p class="para">His Shardblade formed in his hand and he scrambled to the side and sheared through the leg nearest to him. There was a crack in the air. With so many legs down, the beast’s other legs couldn’t hold its weight, particularly when it was trying so hard to crush Dalinar. The remaining legs on its right side snapped with a sickening crunch, spraying out violet ichor, and the beast toppled to the side.</p>
<p class="para">The ground shook, nearly knocking Adolin to his knees. Dalinar tossed aside the now-limp claw, Stormlight from the many cracks steaming above him. Nearby, the king picked himself up off the ground—it had been mere seconds since he’d fallen.</p>
<p class="para">Elhokar stumbled to his feet, looking at the fallen beast. Then he turned to his uncle, the Blackthorn.</p>
<p class="para">Dalinar nodded thankfully to Adolin, then gestured sharply toward what passed for the beast’s neck. Elhokar nodded, then summoned his Blade and rammed it deeply into the monster’s flesh. The creature’s uniform green eyes blackened and shriveled, smoke twisting into the air.</p>
<p class="para">Adolin walked up to join his father, watching as Elhokar plunged his Blade into the chasmfiend’s chest. Now that the beast was dead, the Blade could cut its flesh. Violet ichor spurted out, and Elhokar dropped his blade and reached into the wound, questing with Plate-enhanced arms, grabbing something.</p>
<p class="para">He ripped free the beast’s gemheart—the enormous gemstone that grew within all chasmfiends. It was lumpy and uncut, but it was a pure emerald and as big as a man’s head. It was the largest gemheart Adolin had ever seen, and even the small ones were worth a fortune.</p>
<p class="para">Elhokar held aloft the grisly prize, golden gloryspren appearing around him, and the soldiers yelled in triumph.</p>
