<p class="ct"><span class="epub-i">A Silence Like Screaming</span></p>
<p class="tni">Loial, son of Arent son of Halan, had secretly always wanted to be hasty.</p>
<p class="tx">Humans fascinated him, of <span class="epub-i1">that</span> he made no secret. He was sure most of his friends knew, though he could not be certain. It amazed him what humans didn’t hear. Loial could speak to them all day, then find that they had heard only part. Did they think that someone would speak without intending for others to listen?</p>
<p class="tx">Loial listened when they spoke. Every word out of their mouths revealed more about them. Humans were like the lightning. A flash, an explosion, power and <span class="epub-i1">energy</span>. Then gone. What would it be like?</p>
<p class="tx">Hastiness. There were things to learn from hastiness. He was starting to wonder if he had learned that particular lesson too well.</p>
<p class="tx">Loial strode through a forest of too-silent trees, Erith at his side, other Ogier surrounding them. All held axes on shoulders or carried long knives as they marched toward the battlefront. Erith’s ears twitched; she was not a Treesinger, but she could sense that the trees did not feel right.</p>
<p class="tx">It was horrible, horrible indeed. He could not explain the sense of a healthy stand of trees any more than he could explain the sensation of wind on his skin. There was a rightness, like the scent of morning rain, to healthy trees. It was not a sound, but it felt like a melody. When he sang to them, he found himself swimming in that rightness.</p>
<p class="tx">These trees had no such rightness. If he drew close to them, he felt he could hear something. A silence like screaming. It was not a sound, but a feeling.</p>
<p class="tx">Fighting raged ahead of them in the forest. Queen Elayne’s forces carefully withdrew eastward, out of the trees. They were nearly to the edge of Braem Wood now; once out, they would march for the bridges, cross them and burn them behind. Then the soldiers would launch volleys of destruction at the Trollocs trying to cross the river after them on their own bridges. Bashere hoped to reduce the enemy’s numbers considerably at the Erinin before they continued east.</p>
<p class="tx">Loial was certain this would all make fascinating information for his book, once he wrote it. If he was able to write it. He laid his ears flat as the Ogier began their war song. He lent his voice to theirs, glad for the terrible song—the call to blood, to death—as it filled the silence left by the trees.</p>
<p class="tx">He started running with the others, Erith at his side. Loial drew out in front, axe raised above his head. Thoughts left him as he found himself angry, <span class="epub-i1">furious</span>, at the Trollocs. They didn’t just kill trees. They took the peace from the trees.</p>
<p class="tx">The call to blood, to death.</p>
<p class="tx">Bellowing his song, Loial laid into the Trollocs with his axe, Erith and the other Ogier joining him and stopping the brunt of this Trolloc flanking force. He had not intended to lead the Ogier charge. He did anyway.</p>
<p class="tx">He hacked at the shoulder of a ram-faced Trolloc, shearing its arm free. The thing yelled and fell to its knees, and Erith kicked it in the face, throwing it back into the legs of a Trolloc behind.</p>
<p class="tx">Loial did not stop his song, the call to blood, to death. Let them hear! Let them <span class="epub-i1">hear</span>! Swing after swing. Chopping dead wood, that was all this was. Dead, rotting, horrible wood. He and Erith fell into place with Elder Haman, who—with ears laid back—looked utterly fierce. Placid Elder Haman. He felt the rage too.</p>
<p class="tx">A beleaguered line of Whitecloaks—whom the Ogier had relieved—stumbled back, making way for the Ogier.</p>
<p class="tx">He sang and fought and roared and killed, hacking at Trollocs with an axe meant for cutting wood, and never flesh. Working with wood was a reverent business. This … this was killing weeds. Poisonous weeds. Strangling weeds.</p>
<p class="tx">He continued to chop the Trollocs, losing himself in the call to blood, to death. The Trollocs began to fear. He saw terror in their beady eyes, and he loved it. They were used to fighting men, who were smaller than themselves.</p>
<p class="tx">Well, let the Trollocs fight someone their own size. They snarled as the Ogier line forced them back. Loial landed blow after blow, shearing through arms, hacking through torsos. He shoved his way between two bear Trollocs, laying about him with his axe, yelling in fury—fury now for what the Trollocs had done to the Ogier. They should be enjoying the peace of the <span class="epub-i1">stedding</span>. They should be able to build, sing, and grow.</p>
<p class="tx">They could not. Because of these … these <span class="epub-i1">weeds</span>, they could not! The Ogier were forced to kill. The Trollocs made builders into destroyers. They forced Ogier and humans to be like themselves. The call to blood, to death.</p>
<p class="tx">Well, the Shadow would see just how dangerous the Ogier could be. They <span class="epub-i1">would</span> fight, and they <span class="epub-i1">would</span> kill. And they would do it better than any human, Trolloc or Myrddraal could imagine.</p>
<p class="tx">By the fear Loial saw in the Trollocs—by their terrified eyes—they were beginning to understand.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">“Light!” Galad exclaimed, falling back from the thick of the fight. “<span class="epub-i1">Light!</span>”</p>
<p class="tx">The Ogier attack was terrible and glorious. The creatures fought with ears drawn back, eyes wide, broad faces flat as anvils. They seemed to transform, all placidity gone. They cut through ranks of Trollocs, hacking the beasts to the ground. The second row of Ogier, made up mostly of females, sliced up Trollocs with long knives, bringing down any who made it through the first line.</p>
<p class="tx">Galad had thought Trollocs fearsome with their twisted mix of human and animal features, but the Ogier disturbed him more. Trollocs were simply horrible … but Ogier were gentle, soft-spoken, kindly. Seeing them enraged, bellowing their terrible song and attacking with axes nearly as long as men were tall … Light!</p>
<p class="tx">Galad waved the Children back, then ducked as a Trolloc slammed into a tree nearby. Some of the Ogier were seizing wounded Trollocs by their arms and hurling them out of the way. Many of the other Ogier were blood-soaked to their waists, hacking and chopping like butchers preparing meat. Now and then, one of them fell, but unarmored though they were, their skin seemed tough.</p>
<p class="tx">“Light!” Trom said, moving up to Galad. “Have you ever seen anything like that?”</p>
<p class="tx">Galad shook his head. It was the most honest answer he could think of.</p>
<p class="tx">“If we had an army of those…” Trom said.</p>
<p class="tx">“They’re Darkfriends,” Golever said, joining them. “Shadowspawn for certain.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Ogier are no more Shadowspawn than I am,” Galad said dryly. “Look, they’re <span class="epub-i1">slaughtering</span> the Trollocs.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Any moment now, they’ll all turn on us,” Golever said. “Watch…” He trailed off, listening to the Ogier chant their war song. One large group of Trollocs broke, fleeing back around cursing Myrddraal. The Ogier didn’t let them go. Enraged, the giant Builders chased after the Trollocs, long-handled axes chopping their legs, dropping them in sprays of blood and cries of agony.</p>
<p class="tx">“Well?” Trom asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“Maybe…” Golever said. “Maybe it’s a scheme of some kind. To gain our trust.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Don’t be a fool, Golever,” Trom said.</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m not—”</p>
<p class="tx">Galad held up a hand. “Gather our wounded. Let’s head toward the bridge.”</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Rand let the swirling colors fade from his vision. “It is nearly time for me to go,” he said.</p>
<p class="tx">“To battle?” Moiraine asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“No, to Mat. He is in Ebou Dar.”</p>
<p class="tx">He had returned from Elayne’s camp to Merrilor. The conversation with Tam still bounced around in his head. <span class="epub-i1">Let go.</span> It wasn’t nearly so easy. And yet, something had lifted from him in speaking with his father. <span class="epub-i1">Let go.</span> There seemed a depth to Tam’s words, one far beyond the obvious.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand shook his head. He couldn’t afford to waste time on such thoughts. The Last Battle … it had to claim his attention.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">I have been able to draw close without drawing attention,</span> he thought, fingering the deerhorn-hilted dagger at his belt. <span class="epub-i1">It seems to be true. The Dark One can’t sense me when I carry this.</span></p>
<p class="tx">Before he could move against the Dark One, he had to do something about the Seanchan. If what Thom said was true, Mat might be the key. The Seanchan <span class="epub-i1">had</span> to join the Dragon’s Peace. If they did not … </p>
<p class="tx">“That is an expression I remember,” a soft voice said. “Consternation. You do it so well, Rand al’Thor.”</p>
<p class="tx">He turned toward Moiraine. Beyond her, on the table in his tent, maps that Aviendha had sent by messenger showed positions where his army could gather in the Blight.</p>
<p class="tx">Moiraine stepped up beside Rand. “Did you know that I used to spend hours in thought, trying to discover what that mind of yours was conjuring? It is a wonder I did not pull every hair from my head in frustration.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I was a fool for not trusting you,” Rand said.</p>
<p class="tx">She laughed. A soft laugh, the laugh of an Aes Sedai who was in control. “You trusted me enough. That was what made it all the more frustrating that you would not share.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand breathed in deeply. The air here at Merrilor was sweeter than in other places. He had coaxed the land here back to life. Grass grew. Flowers budded. “Tree stumps and men,” he said to Moiraine. “The Two Rivers has both, and one is about as likely to budge as the other.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Perhaps that is too harsh,” Moiraine said. “It was not merely stubbornness that drove you; it was a will to prove to yourself, and to everyone else, that you could do this on your own.” She touched his arm. “But you cannot do this on your own, can you?”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand shook his head. He reached up to <span class="epub-i1">Callandor</span>, strapped on his back, touching it. The sword’s final secret lay bare to him now. It was a trap, and a clever one, for this weapon was a <span class="epub-i1">sa’angreal</span> not for just the One Power, but for the True Power as well.</p>
<p class="tx">He had thrown away the access key, but on his back he carried something so very tempting. The True Power, the Dark One’s essence, was the sweetest thing he had ever touched. With <span class="epub-i1">Callandor</span>, he could draw it forth in strength such as no man had ever before felt. Because <span class="epub-i1">Callandor</span> lacked the safety measures of most other <span class="epub-i1">angreal</span> and <span class="epub-i1">sa’angreal</span>, there was no telling how much of the Powers it could draw.</p>
<p class="tx">“There it is again,” Moiraine murmured. “What are you planning, Rand al’Thor, Dragon Reborn? Can you finally let go enough to tell me?”</p>
<p class="tx">He eyed her. “Did you set this entire conversation up to pull that secret from me?”</p>
<p class="tx">“You think very highly of my conversational abilities.”</p>
<p class="tx">“An answer that says nothing,” Rand said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes,” Moiraine said. “But might I point out that you did it first in deflecting my question?”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand thought back a few steps in the conversation, and realized he’d done just that. “I’m going to kill the Dark One,” Rand said. “I’m not just going to seal up the Dark One, I’m going to end him.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I thought you had grown up while I was away,” Moiraine said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Only Perrin grew up,” Rand said. “Mat and I have simply learned to pretend to be grown up.” He hesitated. “Mat did not learn it so well.”</p>
<p class="tx">“The Dark One is beyond killing,” Moiraine said.</p>
<p class="tx">“I think I can do it,” Rand said. “I remember what Lews Therin did, and there was a moment … a brief moment … It can happen, Moiraine. I’m more confident that I can do <span class="epub-i1">that</span> than I am that I could seal the Dark One away.” That was true, though he had no real confidence that he could manage either.</p>
<p class="tx">Questions. So many questions. Shouldn’t he have some answers by now?</p>
<p class="tx">“The Dark One is part of the Wheel,” Moiraine said.</p>
<p class="tx">“No. The Dark One is outside the Pattern,” Rand countered. “Not part of the Wheel at all.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Of course the Dark One is part of the Wheel, Rand,” Moiraine said. “<span class="epub-i1">We</span> are the threads that make up the Pattern’s substance, and the Dark One affects us. You cannot kill him. That is a fool’s task.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I have been a fool before,” Rand said. “And I shall be one again. At times, Moiraine, my entire life—all that I’ve done—feels like a fool’s task. What is one more impossible challenge? I’ve met all the others. Perhaps I can accomplish this one too.”</p>
<p class="tx">She tightened her grip on his arm. “You have grown so much, but you are still just a youth, are you not?”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand immediately seized control of his emotions, and did not lash back at her. The surest way to be thought of as a youth was to act like one. He stood straight-backed, and spoke softly. “I have lived for four centuries,” he said. “Perhaps I am still a youth, in that all of us are, compared to the timeless age of the Wheel itself. That said, I am one of the oldest people in existence.”</p>
<p class="tx">Moiraine smiled. “Very nice. Does that work on the others?”</p>
<p class="tx">He hesitated. Then, oddly, he found himself grinning. “It worked pretty well on Cadsuane.”</p>
<p class="tx">Moiraine sniffed. “That one … Well, knowing her, I doubt you fooled her as well as you assume. You may have the memories of a man four centuries old, Rand al’Thor, but that does not make you ancient. Otherwise, Matrim Cauthon would be the patriarch of us all.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Mat? Why Mat?”</p>
<p class="tx">“It is nothing,” Moiraine said. “Something I am not supposed to know. You are still a wide-eyed sheepherder at heart. I would not have it any other way. Lews Therin, for all of his wisdom and power, could not do what you must. Now, if you would be kind, fetch me some tea.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes, Moiraine Sedai,” he said, immediately starting toward the teapot over the fire. He froze, then looked back at her.</p>
<p class="tx">She glanced at him slyly. “Merely seeing if that still worked.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I <span class="epub-i1">never</span> fetched you tea,” Rand protested, walking back to her. “As I remember, I spent our last few weeks together ordering <span class="epub-i1">you</span> around.”</p>
<p class="tx">“So you did,” Moiraine said. “Think about what I said regarding the Dark One. But now I ask you a different question. What will you do <span class="epub-i1">now</span>? Why go to Ebou Dar?”</p>
<p class="tx">“The Seanchan,” Rand said. “I must try to bring them to our side, as I promised.”</p>
<p class="tx">“If I remember,” Moiraine said, “you did not promise that you would try, you promised that you would make it happen.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Promises to ‘try’ don’t achieve much in political negotiations,” Rand said, “no matter how sincere.” He held up his hand before him, arm outstretched, fingers up, and looked out of his open tent flaps. As if he were preparing to grab the lands to the south. Scoop them up, claim them as his, protect them.</p>
<p class="tx">The Dragon on his arm shone, gold and crimson. “Once the Dragon, for remembrance lost.” He held up his other arm, ending at the stump near the wrist. “Twice the Dragon … for the price he must pay.”</p>
<p class="tx">“What will you do if the Seanchan leader refuses again?” Moiraine asked.</p>
<p class="tx">He hadn’t told her that the Empress had refused him the first time. Moiraine didn’t need to be told things. She simply discovered them.</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t know,” Rand said softly. “If they don’t fight, Moiraine, we will lose. If they don’t join the Dragon’s Peace, then we have nothing.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You spent too much time on that pact,” Moiraine said. “It distracted you from your goal. The Dragon does not bring peace, but destruction. You cannot change that with a piece of paper.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We shall see,” Rand said. “Thank you for your advice. Now, and always. I don’t believe I have said that enough. I owe you a debt, Moiraine.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Well,” she said. “I <span class="epub-i1">am</span> still in need of a cup of tea.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand looked at her, incredulous. Then he laughed and walked away to bring her some.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Moiraine held her warm cup of tea, which Rand had fetched for her before leaving. He had become ruler of so much since they had parted, and he was as humble now as when she had first found him in the Two Rivers. Maybe more so.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Humble toward me, perhaps,</span> she thought. <span class="epub-i1">He believes he can slay the Dark One. That is not the sign of a humble man.</span> Rand al’Thor, such an odd mixture of self-effacement and pride. Did he finally have the balance right? Despite what she had said, his action toward her today proved he was no youth, but a man.</p>
<p class="tx">A man could still make mistakes. Often, they were of a more dangerous sort.</p>
<p class="tx">“The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills,” she murmured to herself, sipping the tea. Prepared by Rand’s hand, and not someone else’s, it was as flavorful and vibrant as it had been during better days. Not touched in the least bit by the Dark One’s shadow.</p>
<p class="tx">Yes, the Wheel wove as it willed. Sometimes, she wished that weaving were easier to understand.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">“Everyone knows what to do?” Lan asked, turning in Mandarb’s saddle.</p>
<p class="tx">Andere nodded. He’d carried the word himself to the rulers, and from them it had gone to their generals and commanders. Only at the last moments had it been passed to the soldiers themselves.</p>
<p class="tx">There would be Darkfriends among them. There always were. It was impossible to exterminate rats from a city, no matter how many cats you brought in. The Light willing, this news would come too late for those rats to give warning to the Shadow.</p>
<p class="tx">“We ride,” Lan said, setting heels into Mandarb’s ribs. Andere raised his banner high, the flag of Malkier, and galloped at his side. He was joined by his ranks of Malkieri. Many of those had only a little Malkieri blood in them, and were truly Borderlanders of other nations. They still chose to ride beneath his banner, and had taken up the <span class="epub-i1">hadori</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">Thousands upon thousands of horsemen rode with him, hooves shaking the soft earth. It had been a long, hard retreat for their army. The Trollocs had superior numbers and presented a serious threat of surrounding Lan’s men. Lan’s mounted army was highly mobile, but there was only so much speed you could force upon soldiers, and Trollocs could march quickly. Faster than people could, particularly with those Fades whipping them. Fortunately, the fires in the countryside were slowing the Shadow’s army. Without that, Lan’s men might not have been able to escape.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan crouched in the saddle as the explosions from the Dreadlords began. To his left, the Asha’man Deepe rode, tied to his saddle because of his missing leg. As a ball of fire crackled through the air and arced down toward Lan, Deepe adopted a look of concentration and thrust his hands forward. The fire exploded in the air above them.</p>
<p class="tx">Burning embers fell like crimson rain, trailing smoke. One hit Mandarb’s neck, and Lan brushed it aside with a gauntleted hand. The horse didn’t seem to notice.</p>
<p class="tx">The ground here was of deep clay. The terrain consisted of rolling hills, covered with sere grass, rocky outcrops and groves of defoliated trees. The retreat followed the banks of the Mora; the river would prevent the Trollocs flanking them from the west.</p>
<p class="tx">Smoke bled from two distinct points on the horizon. Fal Dara and Fal Moran. The two grandest cities in Shienar, torched by their own people, along with the lands of their farms and orchards, everything that could provide even a handful of sustenance to the invading Trollocs.</p>
<p class="tx">Holding the cities had not been an option. That meant they had to be destroyed.</p>
<p class="tx">It was time to start hitting back. Lan led a charge at the center of the mass, and the Trollocs set spears against the oncoming rush of Malkieri and Shienaran heavy cavalry. Lan brought his lance down, setting it in position along Mandarb’s neck. He leaned forward in his stirrups, holding tightly with his knees, and hoped that the channelers—Lan now had fourteen, after a small reinforcement from Egwene—could do their part.</p>
<p class="tx">The ground ripped up before the Trollocs. The front line of Trollocs broke.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan chose his target, a massive boar Trolloc that was yelling at its companions as they shied away from the explosions. Lan took the creature in the neck; the lance pierced it, and Mandarb threw the Trolloc to the side while trampling one of the cowering beasts nearby. The roar of the cavalry became a crash as the riders hit hard, letting momentum and weight carry them into the thick of the Trollocs.</p>
<p class="tx">Once they slowed, Lan tossed the lance to Andere, who caught it deftly. Lan’s guards moved in and he slipped his sword from its sheath. Woodsman Tops the Sapling. Apple Blossom on the Wind. The Trollocs made for easy targets when he was in the saddle—the Trollocs’ height presented their necks, shoulders and faces at just the right level.</p>
<p class="tx">It was quick, brutal work. Deepe watched for attacks from the enemy Dreadlords, countering them. Andere moved up to Lan’s side.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan’s banner was a lodestone for the Shadowspawn. They began to roar and rage, and he heard two Trolloc words spoken over and over in their language. <span class="epub-i1">Murdru</span> <span class="epub-i1">Kar</span>. <span class="epub-i1">Murdru</span> <span class="epub-i1">Kar</span>. <span class="epub-i1">Murdru</span> <span class="epub-i1">Kar</span>. He laid about himself with his sword, spilling their blood, coldly, within the void.</p>
<p class="tx">They had taken Malkier from him twice now. They would never be able to taste his sense of defeat, his sense of loss, at leaving his homeland again, this time by choice. But by the Light, he <span class="epub-i1">could</span> bring them close to it. His sword through their chests would do that best.</p>
<p class="tx">The battle descended into chaos, as so many did. The Trollocs fell into frenzy; his army had spent the last four days not engaging the beasts at all. They had only retreated, finally having gained some control over their withdrawal, enough to avoid clashes, at least, which their fires had made possible.</p>
<p class="tx">Four days without a conflict, now this all-out attack. That was the first piece of the plan.</p>
<p class="tx">“Dai Shan!” someone called. Prince Kaisel. He pointed to where the Trollocs had managed to divide Lan’s guard. His banner was tipping.</p>
<p class="tx">Andere. The man’s horse fell, pulled down as Lan urged Mandarb between two Trollocs. Prince Kaisel and a handful of other soldiers joined him.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan couldn’t continue on horseback, lest he accidentally trample his friend. He threw himself from the saddle, hit the ground and crouched beneath a Trolloc swing. Kaisel took that beast’s leg off at the knee.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan dashed past the falling Trolloc. He saw his banner and a body beside it. Alive or dead, Lan did not know, but there <span class="epub-i1">was</span> a Myrddraal raising a dark blade.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan arrived in a rush of wind and spinning steel. He blocked the Thakan’dar blade with a swing of his own, trampling his own banner as he fought. Within the void, there was no time for thought. There was only instinct and action. There was—</p>
<p class="tx">There was a second Myrddraal, rising up from behind Andere’s fallen horse. So, a trap. Take down the banner, draw Lan’s attention.</p>
<p class="tx">The two Fades attacked, one from each side. The void did not shake. A sword could not feel fear, and for that moment, Lan <span class="epub-i1">was</span> the sword. The Heron Spreads Its Wings. Slashing all around him, blocking their blades with his own, back and forth. The Myrddraal were like water, flowing, but Lan was the wind itself. He spun between their blades, knocking back the attack to the right, then the one to the left.</p>
<p class="tx">The Fades began cursing in fury. The one to his left rushed Lan, a sneer on its pale lips. Lan stepped to the side, then parried the creature’s thrust and lopped its arm off at the elbow. He continued in a fluid stroke, his swing continuing to where he knew the other Fade would be attacking, and took its hand off at the wrist.</p>
<p class="tx">Both Thakan’dar blades clanged to the ground. The Fades froze, stupefied for a second. Lan cut the head of one from its neck, then twisted and drove his sword through the neck of the other. Black Pebbles on Snow. He stepped back and swiped his sword to the side to spray some of the deadly blood free of the blade. Both Fades fell, thrashing, flailing at one another, mindless, dark blood staining the ground.</p>
<p class="tx">A good hundred and fifty Trollocs nearby fell writhing to the ground. They’d been linked to the Fades. Lan stepped over to haul Andere out of the mud. The man looked dazed, blinking, and his arm hung at a strange angle. Lan tossed Andere over his shoulder, and kicked his banner by its staff up into his free hand.</p>
<p class="tx">He ran back toward Mandarb—the area around him now clear of Trollocs—and handed the banner to one of Prince Kaisel’s men. “See that cleaned, then raise it.” He slung Andere across the front of his saddle, mounted, and wiped his sword on his saddle blanket. The man didn’t look mortally wounded.</p>
<p class="tx">He faintly heard Prince Kaisel behind. “By my fathers!” the man said. “I’d heard he was good, but … but <span class="epub-i1">Light</span>!”</p>
<p class="tx">“This will do,” Lan said, surveying the battlefield, releasing the void. “Send the signal, Deepe.”</p>
<p class="tx">The Asha’man complied, sending a red streak of light into the air. Lan turned Mandarb and pointed his sword back toward the camp. His forces rallied around him. Their attack had always been meant to be a hit and retreat. They hadn’t maintained a solid battle line. That was difficult with a cavalry charge.</p>
<p class="tx">His troops pulled back, and the Saldaeans and Arafellin arrived, riding in quick waves to break up the Trolloc lines and protect the retreat. Mandarb was wet with sweat; carrying two armored men was a difficult order for the horse, following a charge. Lan slowed the pace, now that they were out of direct harm.</p>
<p class="tx">“Deepe,” Lan asked as they reached the back lines. “How is Andere?”</p>
<p class="tx">“He has a few broken ribs, a broken arm, and a head injury,” Deepe said. “I’d be surprised if he could count to ten on his own right now, but I’ve seen worse. I’ll Heal the head wound; the rest can wait.”</p>
<p class="tx">Lan nodded, reining in. One of his guards—a surly man named Benish who wore a Taraboner veil, though he wore a <span class="epub-i1">hadori</span> above it—helped take Andere off Mandarb; they held him up beside Deepe’s horse. The one-legged Asha’man leaned down from the arrangement of straps that supported him in the saddle, placing his hand on Andere’s head and concentrating.</p>
<p class="tx">The dazed look left Andere’s eyes, and awareness took over. Then he started swearing.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">He’ll be fine,</span> Lan thought, looking at the battlefield. The Shadowspawn were now falling back. It was near dusk.</p>
<p class="tx">Prince Kaisel cantered up beside Lan. “That Saldaean flag bears the red stripe of the Queen,” he said. “She’s riding with them again, Lan.”</p>
<p class="tx">“She is their queen. She can do as she wishes.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You should talk to her,” Kaisel said, shaking his head. “It’s not right, Lan. Other women from the Saldaean army are starting to ride with them as well.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’ve seen Saldaean women spar,” Lan said, still watching the battlefield. “If I were to place a bet on a contest between one of them and a man from any army in the South, I’d bet on the Saldaean any day.”</p>
<p class="tx">“But…”</p>
<p class="tx">“This war is everything or nothing. If I could round up each woman in the Borderlands and put a sword in her hands, I would. For now, I’ll settle for not doing something stupid—like forbidding some trained and passionate soldiers from fighting. If you, however, decide not to exercise that prudence, you are free to tell them what you think. I promise to give you a good burial once they let me take your head down off the pole.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I … Yes, Lord Mandragoran,” Kaisel said.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan took out his spyglass and surveyed the field.</p>
<p class="tx">“Lord Mandragoran?” Kaisel said. “Do you really think this plan will work?”</p>
<p class="tx">“There are too many Trollocs,” Lan said. “The leaders of the Dark One’s armies have been breeding them for years, growing them like weeds. Trollocs eat a lot; each one requires more food than a man to keep it going.</p>
<p class="tx">“By now, they must have eaten the Blight out of anything that could sustain them. The Shadow expended every bit of food they could to create this army, counting on the Trollocs being able to eat the corpses of the fallen.”</p>
<p class="tx">Sure enough, now that the battle had broken off, the Trollocs swarmed the field in their gruesome scavenging. They preferred human meat, but would eat their own fallen. Lan had spent four days running before their army, not giving them any bodies to feast upon.</p>
<p class="tx">They’d managed it only because of the burning of Fal Dara and Fal Moran and other cities in western Shienar. Scouring those cities for food had slowed the Trollocs, allowing Lan’s army to get its feet underneath it and organize its retreat.</p>
<p class="tx">The Shienarans had left nothing edible in any of the nearby cities. Four days without food. The Trollocs didn’t use supply lines; they ate what they came across. They’d be starving. Ravenous. Lan studied them with his spyglass. Many did not wait for the cookpots. They were far more animal than they were human.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">They’re far more Shadow than they are either one,</span> Lan thought, lowering his spyglass. His plan was morbid, but the Light send it would be effective. His men would fight, and there would be casualties. Those casualties would become the bait for the real battle.</p>
<p class="tx">“Now,” Lan whispered.</p>
<p class="tx">Lord Agelmar saw it, too. The horns blew, and a yellow streak of light rose into the air. Lan turned Mandarb, the horse snorting at the command. He was tired, but so was Lan. Both could stand another battle. They had to.</p>
<p class="tx">“<span class="epub-i1">Tai’shar Malkier!</span>” Lan roared, lowering his sword and leading his force back onto the field. All five Borderlander armies converged on the fractured Shadowspawn horde. The Trollocs had broken lines completely to fight over the corpses.</p>
<p class="tx">As Lan thundered toward them, he heard the Myrddraal yelling, trying to force the Trollocs back into order. It was far too late. Many of the famished beasts didn’t look up until the armies were nearly upon them.</p>
<p class="tx">When Lan’s forces hit this time, the effect was very different from before. Earlier, their attack had been slowed by the Trollocs’ close ranks, and they had managed to penetrate only a dozen paces before being forced to take up swords and axes. This time, the Trollocs were spread out. Lan signaled the Shienarans to hit first; their line was so tight, one would have been hard-pressed to find an opening of more than two paces between the horses.</p>
<p class="tx">That left no room for the Trollocs to run or dodge. The riders trampled them in a thunder of hooves and clanking barding, skewering Trollocs on their lances, firing horsebows, laying about themselves with two-handed swords. There seemed to be a special viciousness to the Shienarans as they attacked, wearing their open-fronted helmets and armor made up of flat plates.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan brought his Malkieri cavalry in behind, riding cross-field behind the Shienarans to kill any Trollocs that survived the initial onslaught. Once they’d passed, the Shienarans broke to the right to gather for another pass, but the Arafellin slammed in behind them, slaying more Shadowspawn that were attempting to form up. After them came a wave of Saldaeans crossing as the Malkieri had, then the Kandori sweeping from the other direction.</p>
<p class="tx">Sweating—sword-arm tired—Lan prepared again. Only then did he realize that Prince Kaisel himself was carrying the banner of Malkier. The lad was young, but his heart was right. Though he was somewhat stupid about women.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Light, but we all are, in one way or another,</span> Lan thought. Nynaeve’s distant emotions in the bond comforted him. He could not sense much over the distance, but she seemed determined.</p>
<p class="tx">As Lan began his second sweep, the ground started exploding beneath his men. The Dreadlords had finally realized what was happening and had made their way back to the front lines. Lan directed Mandarb around a crater that erupted in the ground just before him, soil spraying across his chest. The Dreadlords’ appearance was his signal to stop the sweeps; he wanted to ride in, hit hard, and ride out. To fight the Dreadlords, he’d have to commit all of his channelers, which was something he didn’t want to do.</p>
<p class="tx">“Blood and bloody ashes!” Deepe swore as Lan rounded another explosion. “Lord Mandragoran!”</p>
<p class="tx">Lan looked back. Deepe was slowing his horse.</p>
<p class="tx">“Keep moving, man,” Lan said, reining in Mandarb. He signaled for his forces to keep riding, though Prince Kaisel and Lan’s battlefield guard stopped with him.</p>
<p class="tx">“Oh, <span class="epub-i1">Light</span>,” Deepe said, concentrating.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan surveyed the scene. Around them, Trollocs lay dead or dying, howling or simply whimpering. To his left, the mass of Shadowspawn was belatedly forming up. They’d have a unified line soon, and if Lan and the others didn’t move, they’d find themselves alone on the field.</p>
<p class="tx">Deepe had his eyes on a figure standing atop what appeared to be a large siege engine; it had a flat bed, and was perhaps twenty feet tall. A group of Trollocs were heaving it forward, and it rolled on large wooden wheels.</p>
<p class="tx">Yes, there was a figure up there. There were several of them. Balls of fire began to fall toward the Borderlanders as they rode away, and lightning flashed from the sky. Lan suddenly felt like a target on an archery practice field.</p>
<p class="tx">“Deepe!”</p>
<p class="tx">“It’s the M’Hael!” Deepe explained.</p>
<p class="tx">Taim had not been with the enemy army for the last week or so—but now the man had returned, it seemed. It was impossible to tell for sure because of the distance, but the way the man flung weaves in rapid succession, he seemed angry about something.</p>
<p class="tx">“Let’s ride!” Lan yelled.</p>
<p class="tx">“I could take him,” Deepe said. “I could—”</p>
<p class="tx">Lan saw a flash of light, and suddenly Mandarb reared. Lan cursed, trying to blink the afterimage from his eyes. There was something wrong with his ears, too.</p>
<p class="tx">Mandarb bucked and curvetted, quivering. It took a lot to shake the stallion, but a lightning bolt that close would unnerve any horse. A second flash of lightning threw Lan to the ground. He tumbled, grunting, but something—deep within—knew what to do. When he came to himself, he was already on his feet, dizzy, sword in hand. He groaned, staggering.</p>
<p class="tx">Hands grabbed him, hauling him up into a saddle. Prince Kaisel, face bloodied from fighting, held the reins. Lan’s guard made sure he was steady on his mount as they rode away.</p>
<p class="tx">He caught sight of Deepe’s corpse, mangled and lying in pieces, as they fled.</p>
