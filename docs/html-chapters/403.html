<p class="para1"><strong class="calibre14">A Note on Dates in This Glossary.</strong> The Toman Calendar (devised by Toma dur Ahmid) was adopted approximately two centuries after the death of the last male Aes Sedai, recording years After the Breaking of the World (AB). So many records were destroyed in the Trolloc Wars that at their end there was argument about the exact year under the old system. A new calendar, proposed by Tiam of Gazar, celebrated freedom from the Trolloc threat and recorded each year as a Free Year (FY). The Gazaran Calendar gained wide acceptance within twenty years after the Wars’ end. Artur Hawkwing attempted to establish a new calendar based on the founding of his empire (FF, From the Founding), but only historians now refer to it. After the death and destruction of the War of the Hundred Years, a third calendar was devised by Uren din Jubai Soaring Gull, a scholar of the Sea Folk, and promulgated by the Panarch Farede of Tarabon. The Farede Calendar, dating from the arbitrarily decided end of the War of the Hundred Years and recording years of the New Era (NE), is currently in use.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Accepted:</strong> Young women in training to be Aes Sedai who have reached a certain level of power and passed certain tests. It normally takes five to ten years to be raised from novice to Accepted. Somewhat less confined by rules than novices, they are allowed to choose their own areas of study, <a id="page_920" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>within limits. Accepted wear a Great Serpent ring on the third finger of the left hand. When an Accepted is raised Aes Sedai, she chooses her Ajah, gains the right to wear the shawl, and may wear the ring on any finger or not at all if circumstances warrant. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Aes Sedai.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">a’dam</em></strong> (AYE-dam): A device for controlling a woman who can channel, usable only by either a woman who can channel or a woman who can be taught to channel, and having no effect on any woman who cannot channel. It creates a link between the two women. The Seanchan version consists of a collar and bracelet linked by a leash, all of silvery metal. If a man who can channel is linked to a woman by an <em class="calibre4">a’dam</em>, the likely result is death for both. Simply touching an <em class="calibre4">a’dam</em> can result in pain for a man who can channel when the <em class="calibre4">a’dam</em> is being worn by a woman who can channel. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> linking; Seanchan.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Aes Sedai</strong> (EYEZ seh-DEYE): Wielders of the One Power. Since the Breaking of the World ended, all are women. Respected and honored by many, yet widely distrusted and feared, even hated. Also widely blamed for the Breaking of the World, and thought to meddle in the affairs of nations. At the same time, few rulers are without an Aes Sedai advisor, even where such a connection must be secret. Apparently after some years of channeling the One Power, Aes Sedai take on an ageless quality, so that one old enough to be a grandmother may show no signs of age except perhaps a few gray hairs. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Ajah; Amyrlin Seat; Breaking of the World.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Age of Legends:</strong> Age ended by the War of the Shadow and the Breaking of the World. A time when Aes Sedai performed wonders now only dreamed of. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Breaking of the World; War of the Shadow.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Aiel</strong> (eye-EEL): The people of the Aiel Waste. Fierce and hardy. They veil their faces before they kill. Deadly warriors with weapons or bare hands, they will not touch a sword even on the point of death, nor ride a horse unless pressed. Aiel call battle “the dance,” and “the dance of spears.” They are divided into twelve clans: the Chareen, the Codarra, the Daryne, the Goshien, the Miagoma, the Nakai, the Reyn, the Shaarad, the Shaido, the Shiande, the Taardad, and the Tomanelle. Each clan is divided into septs. Sometimes they speak of a thirteenth clan, the Clan That Is Not, the Jenn, who were the builders of Rhuidean. All know that Aiel supposedly once failed the Aes Sedai and were banished to the Aiel Waste for that sin, and that they will be destroyed if they ever fail the Aes Sedai again. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Aiel warrior societies; Aiel Waste; <em class="calibre4">gai’shain</em>; bleakness; Rhuidean.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><a id="page_921" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14">Aiel War</strong> (976–78 NE): When King Laman (LAY-mahn) of Cairhien cut down <em class="calibre4">Avendoraldera</em>, four clans of the Aiel crossed the Spine of the World. They looted and burned the capital city of Cairhien as well as many other cities and towns, and the conflict extended into Andor and Tear. By the conventional view, the Aiel were finally defeated at the Battle of the Shining Walls, before Tar Valon; in fact, Laman was killed in that battle, and having done what they came for, the Aiel re-crossed the Spine. <em class="calibre4">See also Avendoraldera</em>; Cairhien; Spine of the World.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Aiel warrior societies:</strong> Aiel warriors are all members of one of twelve societies. These are Black Eyes (<em class="calibre4">Seia Doon</em>), Brothers of the Eagle (<em class="calibre4">Far Aldazar Din</em>), Dawn Runners (<em class="calibre4">Rahien Sorei</em>), Knife Hands (<em class="calibre4">Sovin Nai</em>), Maidens of the Spear (<em class="calibre4">Far Dareis Mai</em>), Mountain Dancers (<em class="calibre4">Hama N’dore</em>), Night Spears (<em class="calibre4">Cor Darei</em>), Red Shields (<em class="calibre4">Aethan Dor</em>), Stone Dogs (<em class="calibre4">Shae’en M’taal</em>), Thunder Walkers (<em class="calibre4">Sha’mad Conde</em>), True Bloods (<em class="calibre4">Tain Shari</em>), and Water Seekers (<em class="calibre4">Duadhe Mahdi’in</em>). Each has its own customs, and sometimes specific duties. For example, Red Shields act as police, and Stone Dogs are often used as rear guards during retreats, while Maidens are often scouts. Aiel clans frequently raid and battle one another, but members of the same society will not fight each other even if their clans do so. Thus there are always lines of contact between the clans, even during open warfare. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Aiel; Aiel Waste; <em class="calibre4">Far Dareis Mai.</em></p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Aiel Waste:</strong> Harsh, rugged and all-but-waterless land east of the Spine of the World. Called the Three-fold Land by the Aiel. Few outsiders enter; the Aiel consider themselves at war with all other peoples and do not welcome strangers. Only peddlers, gleemen, and the Tuatha’an are allowed safe entry, although Aiel avoid all contact with the Tuatha’an, whom they call “the Lost Ones.” No maps of the Waste itself are known to exist.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Ajah</strong> (AH-jah): Societies among the Aes Sedai, seven in number and designated by colors: Blue, Red, White, Green, Brown, Yellow and Gray. All Aes Sedai except the Amyrlin Seat belong to one. Each follows a specific philosophy of the use of the One Power and the purposes of the Aes Sedai. The Red Ajah bends its energies to finding men who can channel, and to gentling them. The Brown forsakes the mundane world and dedicates itself to seeking knowledge, while the White, largely eschewing both the world and the value of worldly knowledge, devotes itself to questions of philosophy and truth. The Green Ajah (called the Battle Ajah during the Trolloc Wars) holds itself ready for <a id="page_922" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>Tarmon Gai’don, the Yellow concentrates on the study of Healing, and Blue sisters involve themselves with causes and justice. The Gray are mediators, seeking harmony and consensus. A Black Ajah, dedicated to serving the Dark One, is officially and vehemently denied.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Altara</strong> (al-TAH-rah): A nation on the Sea of Storms, though in truth little unifies it except a name. The people of Altara think of themselves as inhabitants of a town or village, or as this lord’s or that lady’s people, first, and only second if at all as Altaran. Few nobles pay taxes to the crown or offer more than lip service, and that often slight. The ruler of Altara (currently Queen Tylin Quintara of House Mitsobar; TIE-lihn quin-TAHR-ah; MIHT-soh-bahr) is seldom more than the most powerful noble in the land, and at times has not even really been that. The Throne of the Winds holds so little power that many powerful nobles have scorned to take it when they could have.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Amyrlin Seat</strong> (AHM-ehr-lihn SEAT): (1) Leader of the Aes Sedai. Elected for life by the Hall of the Tower, which consists of three representatives (called Sitters, as in “a Sitter for the Green”) from each Ajah. The Amyrlin Seat has, theoretically, supreme authority among the Aes Sedai, and ranks as the equal of a king or queen. A slightly less formal usage is “the Amyrlin.” (2) The throne on which the leader of the Aes Sedai sits.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Amys</strong> (ah-MEESE): Wise One of Cold Rocks Hold, and a dreamwalker. An Aiel of the Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel. Wife of Rhuarc, sister-wife to Lian (lee-AHN), who is roofmistress of Cold Rocks Hold. Amys is sister-mother to Aviendha.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">angreal</em></strong> (ahn-gree-AHL): Remnants of the Age of Legends that allow anyone capable of channeling to handle a greater amount of the Power than is safe or even possible unaided. Some were made for use by women, others by men. Rumors of <em class="calibre4">angreal</em> usable by both men and women have never been confirmed. Their making is no longer known, and few remain in existence. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> channel; <em class="calibre4">sa’angreal</em>; <em class="calibre4">ter’angreal.</em></p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Arad Doman</strong> (AH-rad do-MAHN): Nation on the Aryth Ocean. Presently racked by civil war and simultaneously by wars against those who have declared for the Dragon Reborn and against Tarabon. Domani women are famous—or infamous—for their beauty, seductiveness and scandalous clothes.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Artur Hawkwing:</strong> Legendary king, Artur Paendrag Tanreall (AHR-tuhr PAY-ehn-DRAG tahn-REE-ahl). Ruled FY 943–94. United all lands west of the Spine of the World. Sent armies across the Aryth Ocean <a id="page_923" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>(FY 992), but contact with these was lost at his death, which set off the War of the Hundred Years. His sign was a golden hawk in flight. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> War of the Hundred Years.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Atha’an Miere</strong> (ah-thah-AHN mee-EHR): <em class="calibre4">See</em> Sea Folk.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">Avendoraldera</em></strong> (AH-ven-doh-ral-DEH-rah): Tree grown in the city of Cairhien from a sapling of <em class="calibre4">Avendesora</em>, a gift from the Aiel in 566 NE, although no record shows any connection between the Aiel and the legendary Tree of Life.</p>
<p class="para1"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Bair</strong> (BAYR): A Wise One of the Haido sept of the Shaarad Aiel. A dreamwalker. She cannot channel. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> dreamwalker.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Berelain sur Paendrag</strong> (BEH-reh-lain suhr PAY-ehn-DRAG): First of Mayene, Blessed of the Light, Defender of the Waves, High Seat of House Paeron (pay-eh-ROHN). A beautiful and willful young woman, and a skillful ruler. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Mayene.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Birgitte</strong> (ber-GEET-teh): Hero of legend and story, renowned for her beauty almost as much as for her bravery and skill at archery. Supposedly carried a silver bow and silver arrows with which she never missed. One of the heroes to be called back when the Horn of Valere is sounded. Always linked with the hero-swordsman Gaidal Cain. Except for her beauty and skill with a bow, she is little like the stories of her. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Horn of Valere.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Bleakness, the:</strong> Term given by the Aiel to the effects on many of learning that rather than having always been fierce warriors, their ancestors were strict pacifists forced into defending themselves during the Breaking of the World and the years following. Many feel that this was their failure of the Aes Sedai. Some throw down their spears and run away. Others refuse to put off <em class="calibre4">gai’shain</em> white when their time is up. Still others deny the truth of this, and with it deny necessarily that Rand al’Thor is truly the <em class="calibre4">Car’a’carn</em>; these either return to the Aiel Waste or go to join the Shaido opposing him. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Aiel; Aiel Waste; <em class="calibre4">Car’a’carn; gai’shain.</em></p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Blight, the:</strong> <em class="calibre4">See</em> Great Blight.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Borderlands:</strong> The nations bordering the Great Blight: Saldaea, Arafel, Kandor, and Shienar. Their history is one of unending raids and war against Trollocs and Myrddraal. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Great Blight.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Breaking of the World:</strong> During the Time of Madness, male Aes Sedai who had gone insane changed the face of the earth. They leveled mountain ranges and raised new mountains, lifted dry land where seas had been and made oceans cover once dry land. Much of the world was <a id="page_924" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>completely depopulated, the survivors scattered like dust on the wind. This destruction is remembered in stories, legends, and history as the Breaking of the World.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Bryne, Gareth</strong> (BRIHN, GAH-rehth): Once Captain-General of the Queen’s Guards in Andor. Exiled by Queen Morgase. Considered one of the greatest generals living. The sigil of House Bryne is a wild bull, the rose crown of Andor around its neck. Gareth Bryne’s personal sigil is three golden stars, each of five rays.</p>
<p class="para1"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">cadin’sor</em></strong> (KAH-dihn-sohr): Garb of Aiel warriors; coat and breeches in browns and grays that fade into rock or shadow, along with soft, laced knee-high boots. In the Old Tongue, “working clothes,” though this is of course an imprecise translation.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Cairhien</strong> (KEYE-ree-EHN): Both a nation along the Spine of the World and the capital city of that nation. The city was burned and looted during the Aiel War, as were many other towns and villages. The abandonment of farmland near the Spine of the World after the war made necessary the importation of grain. The assassination of King Galldrian (998 NE) resulted in war for succession to the Sun Throne, disrupting grain shipments and bringing famine. The city was besieged by the Shaido in what some now call the Second Aiel War; this siege was lifted by other Aiel under the command of Rand al’Thor. The banner of Cairhien is a many-rayed golden sun rising on a field of sky blue. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Aiel War.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">calendar:</strong> There are 10 days to the week, 28 days to the month and 13 months to the year. Several feast days are not part of any month; these include Sunday (the longest day of the year), the Feast of Thanksgiving (once every four years at the spring equinox), and the Feast of All Souls Salvation, also called All Souls Day (once every ten years at the autumn equinox).</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">Callandor</em></strong> (CAH-lahn-DOOR): The Sword That Is Not a Sword, the Sword That Cannot Be Touched. Crystal sword once held in the Stone of Tear. A powerful male <em class="calibre4">sa’angreal.</em> Its removal from the chamber called the Heart of the Stone was, along with the fall of the Stone, a major sign of the Dragon’s Rebirth and the approach of Tarmon Gai’don. Replaced in the Heart, driven into the stone, by Rand al’Thor. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Dragon Reborn; <em class="calibre4">sa’angreal</em>; Stone of Tear.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Car’a’carn:</strong> In the Old Tongue, “chief of chiefs.” According to Aiel prophecy, a man who would come from Rhuidean at dawn, marked with two <a id="page_925" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>Dragons, and lead them across the Dragonwall. The Prophecy of Rhuidean says that he will unite the Aiel and destroy them, all but a remnant of a remnant. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Aiel; Rhuidean.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Caraighan Maconar</strong> (kah-RYE-gihn mah-CON-ahr): Legendary Green sister (212 AB–373 AB), the heroine of a hundred adventures credited with exploits that even some Aes Sedai consider improbable despite their inclusion in the records of the White Tower, such as single-handedly putting down a rebellion in Mosadorin and quelling the Comaidin Riots at a time when she had no Warders. Considered by the Green Ajah to be the archetype of a Green sister. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Aes Sedai; Ajah.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Carridin, Jaichim</strong> (CAHR-ih-dihn, JAY-kim): An Inquisitor of the Hand of the Light, a high officer of the Children of the Light and a Darkfriend.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Cauthon, Abell</strong> (CAW-thon, AY-bell): A farmer in the Two Rivers. Father of Mat Cauthon. Wife: Natti (NAT-tee). Daughters: Eldrin (EHL-drihn), and Bodewhin (BOHD-wihn), called Bode.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">channel</strong> (verb): To control the flow of the One Power. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> One Power.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Children of the Light:</strong> Society of strict ascetic beliefs, owing allegiance to no nation and dedicated to the defeat of the Dark One and the destruction of all Darkfriends. Founded during the War of the Hundred Years to proselytize against an increase in Darkfriends, they evolved during the war into a completely military society. Extremely rigid in beliefs, and certain that only they know the truth and the right. Consider Aes Sedai and any who support them to be Darkfriends. Known disparagingly as Whitecloaks. Their sign is a golden sunburst on a field of white. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Questioners.</p>
<p class="para1"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Darkfriends:</strong> Adherents of the Dark One. They believe they will gain great power and rewards, even immortality, when he is freed. Among themselves, they sometimes use the ancient name Friends of the Dark.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Dark One:</strong> Most common name, used in every land, for Shai’tan (SHAY-ih-TAN). The source of evil, antithesis of the Creator. Imprisoned by the Creator in Shayol Ghul at the moment of Creation. An attempt to free him brought about the War of the Shadow, the tainting of <em class="calibre4">saidin</em>, the Breaking of the World and the end of the Age of Legends. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Dragon, Prophecies of the.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Daughter-Heir:</strong> Title of the heir to the Lion Throne of Andor. Without a surviving daughter, the throne goes to the nearest female blood relation <a id="page_926" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>of the Queen. Dissension over exactly who was nearest by blood has several times led to power struggles, the latest being “the Succession”—so called in Andor and “the Third War of Andoran Succession” elsewhere—which brought Morgase of House Trakand to the throne.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Deane Aryman</strong> (dee-AHN-eh AH-rih-mahn): Amyrlin Seat who saved the White Tower from the damage done by Bonwhin in attempting to control Artur Hawkwing. Born circa FY 920 in the village of Salidar, in Shiota, she was raised Amyrlin from the Blue Ajah in FY 992. Credited with convincing Souran Maravaile to raise the siege of Tar Valon (which had begun in FY 975) at Hawkwing’s death. Deane restored the Tower’s prestige, and it is believed that at the time of her death in FY 1084, in a fall from a horse, she was on the point of convincing the nobles warring over the remains of Hawkwing’s empire to accept the leadership of the White Tower as a means of restoring unity to the land. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Amyrlin Seat; Artur Hawkwing.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Dragon, false:</strong> Name given to various men who have claimed to be the Dragon Reborn. Some began wars that involved many nations. Over the centuries most were unable to channel, but a few could. All, however, either disappeared or were captured or killed without fulfilling any of the Prophecies of the Dragon. Among those who could channel, the most powerful were Raolin Darksbane (335–36 AB), Yurian Stonebow (circa 1300–1308 AB), Davian (FY 351), Guaire Amalasan (FY 939–43), Logain (997 NE) and Mazrim Taim (998 NE). <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Dragon Reborn.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Dragon, Prophecies of the:</strong> Little known except among the well-educated and seldom spoken of, the Prophecies, given in <em class="calibre4">The Karaethon Cycle</em> (ka-REE-ah-thon), foretell that the Dark One will be freed again, and that Lews Therin Telamon, the Dragon, will be Reborn to fight Tarmon Gai’don, the Last Battle against the Shadow. He will, say the Prophecies, save the world—and Break it again. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Dragon, the.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Dragon, the:</strong> Name by which Lews Therin Telamon was known during the War of the Shadow, some three thousand or more years ago.

<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Dragon Reborn:</strong> According to the Prophecies of the Dragon, the man who is the Rebirth of Lews Therin Kinslayer.

<p class="hangindent-para4"><a id="page_927" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14">Dreadlords:</strong> Men and women able to channel, who went over to the Shadow during the Trolloc Wars, acting as generals over armies of Trollocs and Darkfriends. Occasionally confused with the Forsaken by the less well educated.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Dreamer:</strong> <em class="calibre4">See</em> Talents.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">dreamwalker:</strong> Aiel name for a woman able to enter <em class="calibre4">Tel’aran’rhiod</em>, interpret dreams and speak to others in their dreams. Aes Sedai also use the term, referring to Dreamers, but rarely, and they capitalize it—Dreamwalker. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Talents; <em class="calibre4">Tel’aran’rhiod.</em></p>

<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Elaida do Avriny a’Roihan</strong> (eh-LY-da dob. AHV-rih-nee ah-ROY-han): An Aes Sedai, formerly of the Red Ajah, now raised to the Amyrlin Seat. Once advisor to Queen Morgase of Andor. She sometimes has the Foretelling.</p>

A Maiden may not marry and remain in the society, nor may she fight while carrying a child. Any child born to a Maiden is given to another woman to raise, in such a way that no one knows the child’s mother. (“You may belong to no man, nor may any man belong to you, nor any child. The spear is your lover, your child and your life.”) <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Aiel; Aiel warrior societies.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">first-sister; first-brother:</strong> Aiel kinship term meaning having the same mother. Among the Aiel, having the same mother means a closer relationship than having the same father.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Five Powers:</strong> There are threads to the One Power, named according to the sorts of things that can be done using them—Earth, Air (sometimes called Wind), Fire, Water and Spirit, which are called the Five Powers. A wielder of the Power will have a greater strength with one, possibly two but rarely more, and lesser with the others. In the Age of Legends, Spirit was found equally in men and in women, but great ability with Earth and/or Fire occurred much more often among men, ability with Water and/or Air among women. Despite exceptions, it was so often so that Earth and Fire came to be regarded as male Powers, Air and Water as female.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Flame of Tar Valon:</strong> Symbol of Tar Valon, the Amyrlin Seat, and the Aes Sedai. A stylized representation of a flame; a white teardrop, point upward.</p>

The names given to them are still used to frighten children. They were: Aginor (AGH-ih-nohr), Asmodean (ahs-MOH-dee-an), Balthamel (BAAL-thah-mell), Be’lal (BEH-lahl), Demandred (DEE-man-drehd), Graendal (GREHN-dahl), Ishamael (ih-SHAH-may-EHL), Lanfear (LAN-feer), Mesaana (meh-SAH-nah), Moghedien (moh-GHEH-dee-ehn), Rahvin (RAAV-ihn), Sammael (SAHM-may-EHL) and Semirhage (SEH-mih-RHAHG).</p>

<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">gentling:</strong> The act, performed by Aes Sedai, of shutting off a male who can channel from the One Power. Necessary because any man who channels will go insane from the taint on <em class="calibre4">saidin</em> and almost certainly do horrible <a id="page_929" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>things with the Power in his madness before the taint kills him. One who has been gentled can still sense the True Source, but cannot touch it. Whatever madness has come before gentling is arrested but not cured, and if it is done soon enough death can be averted. A man who is gentled, however, inevitably gives up wanting to live; those who do not succeed in committing suicide usually die anyway within a year or two. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> One Power; stilling.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">linking:</strong> The ability of women who can channel to combine their flows of the One Power. While the combined flow is not as great as the sum total of the individual flows, it is directed by the person who leads the link and that can be used much more precisely and to far greater effect than the individual flows could be. Men cannot link their abilities without the presence of a woman or women in the circle. Up to thirteen women can link without the presence of a man. With the addition of one man, the circle can increase to twenty-six women. Two men can take the circle to include thirty-four women, and so on until the limit of six men and sixty-six women is reached. There are links that include more men and fewer women, but except in the linking of one man and one woman, one woman and two men, or of course, two men and two women, there must always be at least one more woman in the circle than there are men. In most circles, either a man or a woman can control the link, but a man must control in the circle of seventy-two as well as in mixed circles of fewer than thirteen. Although men are in general stronger in the Power than women, the strongest circles are those which contain as near as possible to equal numbers of men and women. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Aes Sedai.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Moiraine Damodred</strong> (mwah-RAIN DAHM-oh-drehd): Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah. Born 956 NE in the Royal Palace of Cairhien. After coming to the White Tower as a novice in 972 NE, her rise was meteoric, being raised Accepted in just three years and Aes Sedai only three more after that, at the end of the Aiel War. From that time she began a search for the young man who had (according to Gitara Morose, an Aes Sedai with the Foretelling) been born on the slopes of Dragonmount during the Battle of the Shining Walls and who would be the Dragon Reborn. It was she who took Rand al’Thor, Mat Cauthon, Perrin Aybara and Egwene al’Vere out of the Two Rivers. She vanished into a <em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em> in Cairhien while battling Lanfear, apparently killing both herself and the Forsaken.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Myrddraal</strong> (MUHRD-draal): Creatures of the Dark One, commanders of the Trollocs. Twisted offspring of Trollocs in which the human stock used to create the Trollocs has resurfaced, but tainted by the evil that made the Trollocs. They have no eyes, but can see like eagles in light or dark. They have certain powers stemming from the Dark One, including the ability to cause paralyzing fear with a look, and to vanish <a id="page_932" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>wherever there are shadows. Among Myrddraal’s known weaknesses is that they are reluctant to cross running water. Mirrors reflect them only mistily. In different lands they are known by many names, among them Halfman, the Eyeless, Shadowman, Lurk, Fetch and Fade.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Oaths, Three:</strong> The oaths taken by an Accepted on being raised to Aes Sedai. Spoken while holding the Oath Rod, a <em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em> that makes oaths binding. They are: (1) To speak no word that is not true. (2) To make no weapon with which one man may kill another. (3) Never to use the One Power as a weapon except against Darkfriends or Shadowspawn, or in the last extreme of defense of her own life, or that of her Warder or another Aes Sedai. The second oath was the first adopted after the War of the Shadow. The first oath, while held to the letter, is often circumvented by careful speaking. It is believed that the last two are inviolable.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Ogier</strong> (OH-gehr): (1) A nonhuman race, characterized by great height (ten feet is average for adult males), broad, almost snoutlike noses and long, tufted ears. They live in areas called <em class="calibre4">stedding</em>, which they rarely leave, and they typically have little contact with humankind. Knowledge of them among humans is sparse, and many believe Ogier to be only legends, though they are wondrous stonemasons and built most of the great cities constructed after the Breaking. Although they are thought to be a pacific people and extremely slow to anger, some old stories say they fought alongside humans in the Trolloc Wars, and call them implacable enemies. By and large, they are extremely fond of knowledge, and their books and stories often contain information lost to humans. A typical Ogier life span is at least three to four times that of a human. (2) Any individual of that nonhuman race. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Breaking of the World; <em class="calibre4">stedding.</em></p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Old Tongue:</strong> The language spoken during the Age of Legends.

Translation is often difficult, as it is a language capable of many subtly different meanings. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Age of Legends.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">One Power:</strong> The power drawn from the True Source. The vast majority of people are completely unable to learn to channel the One Power. A very small number can be taught to channel, and an even tinier number <a id="page_933" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>have the ability inborn. These few have no need to be taught; eventually they will channel whether they want to or not, often without even realizing what they are doing. This inborn ability usually manifests itself in late adolescence or early adulthood. If control is not taught, or self-learned (extremely difficult, with a success rate of only one in four), death is certain. Since the Time of Madness, no man has been able to channel the Power without eventually going completely, horribly mad, and then, even if he has learned some control, dying from a wasting sickness that causes the sufferer to rot alive, a sickness caused, as is the madness, by the Dark One’s taint on <em class="calibre4">saidin.

<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Padan Fain</strong> (PAD-an FAIN): Once a peddler trading into the Two Rivers, and a Darkfriend, he was transformed at Shayol Ghul not only to enable him to find the young man who would become the Dragon Reborn as a hound finds prey for the hunter, but to ingrain the need to find him. The pain of this induced in Fain a hatred both of the Dark One and of Rand al’Thor. While following al’Thor, he encountered the trapped soul of Mordeth in Shadar Logoth, and this soul tried to take Fain’s body. Because of what had been made of Fain, though, the result was an amalgamation which was mostly Fain and which has abilities beyond what either man had originally, though Fain does not understand them fully yet. Most men feel fear at a Myrddraal’s eyeless gaze; Myrddraal feel fear at Fain’s gaze.</p>

Avowed purposes are to discover the truth in disputations and uncover Darkfriends. In the search for truth and the Light, their normal method of inquiry is torture, their normal manner that they know the truth already and must only make their victim confess to it. Refer to themselves as the Hand of the Light, the Hand that digs out truth, and at times act as if they were entirely separate from the Children and the Council of the Anointed, which commands the Children. The head of the Questioners is the High Inquisitor, who sits on the Council of the Anointed. Their sign is a blood-red shepherd’s crook. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Children of the Light.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Rhuidean</strong> (RHUY-dee-ahn): A great city, the only one in the Aiel Waste and totally unknown to the outside world. Abandoned for nearly three thousand years. Once men among the Aiel were allowed to enter Rhuidean only once, in order to be tested inside a great <em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em> for fitness to become clan chief (only one in three survived), and women only twice, for testing to become Wise Ones, the second time in the same <em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em>, though with a considerably higher survival rate than the men. Now the city is inhabited again, by Aiel, and a great lake occupies one end of the valley of Rhuidean, fed by an underground ocean of fresh water and in turn feeding the only river in the Waste. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Aiel.</p>

A <em class="calibre4">sa’angreal</em> is similar to, but more powerful than, an <em class="calibre4">angreal.</em> The amount of the Power that can be wielded with a <em class="calibre4">sa’angreal</em> compares to the amount that can be handled with an <em class="calibre4">angreal</em> as the Power wielded with the aid of an <em class="calibre4">angreal</em> does to the amount that can be handled unaided. The making of them is no longer known.

(2) The land from which the Seanchan come.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">sister-wife:</strong> Aiel kinship term. Aielwomen who are near-sisters or first-sisters who discover they love the same man, or who simply do not want a man to come between them, will both marry him, thus becoming sister-wives. Women who love the same man will sometimes try to find out whether they can become near-sisters and adopted first-sisters, a first step to becoming sister-wives.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Sorilea</strong> (soh-rih-LEE-ah): The Wise One of Shende Hold, a Jarra Chareen. Barely able to channel, she is the oldest living Wise One, though not by as much as many think.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">stedding</em></strong> (STEHD-ding): An Ogier (OH-gehr) homeland. Many <em class="calibre4">stedding</em> have been abandoned since the Breaking of the World. They are shielded in some way, no longer understood, so that within them no Aes Sedai can channel the One Power, nor even sense the True Source. Attempts to wield the One Power from outside a <em class="calibre4">stedding</em> have no effect inside the <em class="calibre4">stedding</em> boundary. No Trolloc will enter a <em class="calibre4">stedding</em> unless driven, and even Myrddraal will do so only at the greatest need and with the greatest reluctance. Even Darkfriends, if truly dedicated, feel uncomfortable within a <em class="calibre4">stedding.</em></p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">stilling:</strong> The removal of a woman’s ability to channel. A woman who has been stilled can sense but not touch the True Source. Officially, stilling is the result of trial and sentence for a crime. Novices in the White Tower are required to learn the name and crimes of all women who have suffered stilling. When the ability to channel is lost accidentally, it is called being burned out, though “stilling” is often used for that also. Women who are stilled, however it occurs, seldom survive long; they seem to simply give up and die unless they find something to replace the emptiness left by the One Power.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Stone of Tear:</strong> A great fortress in the city of Tear, said to have been made with the One Power soon after the Breaking of the World.

<p class="hangindent-para4"><a id="page_936" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14">Talents:</strong> Abilities in the use of the One Power in specific areas. Aptitude in various Talents varies widely from individual to individual and is seldom related to the strength of the individual’s ability to channel. There are major Talents, the best known and most widespread of which is Healing. Other examples are Cloud Dancing, the control of weather, and Earth Singing, which involves controlling movements of the earth—for example, preventing, or causing, earthquakes or avalanches. There are also minor Talents, seldom given a name, such as the ability to see <em class="calibre4">ta’veren</em> or to duplicate the chance-twisting effect of <em class="calibre4">ta’veren</em>, though in a very small and localized area rarely covering more than a few square feet. Many Talents are now known only by their names and sometimes vague descriptions. Some, such as Traveling (the ability to shift from one place to another without crossing the intervening space) are only now being re-discovered. Others, such as Foretelling (the ability to foretell future events, but in a general way) and Delving (the location of ores and possibly their removal from the ground), are found rarely. Another Talent long thought lost is Dreaming, interpreting the Dreamer’s dreams to foretell future events in more specific fashion than Foretelling. Some Dreamers had the ability to enter <em class="calibre4">Tel’aran’rhiod</em>, the World of Dreams, and (it is said) even other people’s dreams.

Many can touch <em class="calibre4">Tel’aran’rhiod</em> for a few moments in their dreams, but few have ever had the ability to enter it at will, though some <em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em> confer that ability.

<p class="hangindent-para4"><a id="page_938" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14">Trolloc Wars:</strong> A series of wars, beginning about 1000 AB and lasting more than three hundred years, during which Trolloc armies ravaged the world under the command of Myrddraal and Dreadlords. Eventually the Trollocs were driven back into the Great Blight, but some nations ceased to exist, and others that survived were almost depopulated. All records of the time are fragmentary. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Dreadlords; Myrddraal; Trollocs.</p>

Divided into a male half (<em class="calibre4">saidin</em>) and a female half (<em class="calibre4">saidar</em>), which work at the same time with and against each other. Only a man can draw on <em class="calibre4">saidin</em>, only a woman on <em class="calibre4">saidar.</em> For more than three thousand years, <em class="calibre4">saidin</em> has been tainted by the Dark One’s touch. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> One Power.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Warder:</strong> A warrior bonded to an Aes Sedai. The bonding is a thing of the One Power: by it he gains such gifts as quick healing, the ability to go long periods without food, water, or rest and the ability to sense the taint of the Dark One at a distance. So long as a Warder lives, the Aes Sedai to whom he is bonded knows he is alive however far away he is, and when he dies she will know the moment and manner of his death. While most Ajahs believe an Aes Sedai may have one Warder bonded to her at a time, the Red Ajah refuses to bond any Warders at all, and the Green Ajah believes an Aes Sedai may bond as many as she wishes. Ethically the Warder must accede to the bonding voluntarily, but it has been known to be done against the Warder’s will. What the Aes Sedai gain from the bonding is a closely held secret. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Aes Sedai.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">War of the Hundred Years</strong> (FY 994–FY 1117): A series of overlapping wars among constantly shifting alliances, precipitated by the death of Artur Hawkwing and the resulting struggle for his empire. The War of the Hundred Years depopulated large parts of the lands between the Aryth Ocean and the Aiel Waste, from the Sea of Storms to the Great Blight. So great was the destruction that only fragmentary records of the time remain. The empire of Artur Hawkwing was pulled apart, and the nations of the present day were formed. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Hawkwing, Artur.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">War of the Shadow:</strong> Also known as the War of Power. Began shortly after the attempt to free the Dark One, and soon involved the whole world. In a world where even the memory of war had been forgotten, <a id="page_939" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>every facet of war was rediscovered, often twisted by the Dark One’s touch on the world, and the One Power was used as a weapon. The war was ended by the resealing of the Dark One into his prison in a strike led by Lews Therin Telamon, the Dragon, and one hundred male Aes Sedai called the Hundred Companions. The Dark One’s counterstroke tainted <em class="calibre4">saidin</em> and drove Lews Therin and the Hundred Companions insane, thus beginning the Time of Madness and the Breaking of the World. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Dragon, the; One Power, the.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">wilder:</strong> A woman who has learned to channel the One Power on her own; only one in four survive this. Such women usually build barriers against knowing what it is they are doing, but if these can be broken down, wilders are among the most powerful of channelers. The term is often used in derogatory fashion.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Wisdom:</strong> In villages, a woman chosen by the Women’s Circle for her knowledge of such things as healing and foretelling the weather, as well as common good sense. Generally considered the equal of the Mayor, and in some villages his superior. She is chosen for life, and it is very rare for a Wisdom to be removed from office before her death. Depending on the land, she may instead have another title, such as Guide, Healer, Wise Woman or Seeker, among others.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para4"><strong class="calibre14">Wise One:</strong> Among the Aiel, Wise Ones are women chosen by other Wise Ones and trained in healing, herbs and other things, much like Wisdoms. They have great authority and responsibility, as well as great influence with sept and clan chiefs, though these men often accuse them of meddling. A good many Wise Ones can channel to one degree or another; they find every Aiel woman born with the spark in her and most of those who can learn. The fact that Wise Ones can channel is not spoken of among Aiel, by custom. Also by custom, Wise Ones avoid all contact with Aes Sedai, even more so than other Aiel. Wise Ones stand <a id="page_940" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>outside all feuds and battle, and according to <em class="calibre4">ji’e’toh</em> may not be harmed or impeded in any way. For a Wise One to take part in a battle would be a great violation of custom and tradition. Three Wise Ones now living are dreamwalkers, with the ability to enter <em class="calibre4">Tel’aran’rhiod</em> and to speak to other people in their dreams among other things. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> dreamwalker; <em class="calibre4">Tel’aran’rhiod.</em></p>
