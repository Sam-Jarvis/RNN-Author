<p class="chapterOpenerText">Gawyn sat on a bench in the Caemlyn Palace gardens. It had been several hours since he’d sent Egwene’s messenger away. A gibbous moon hung fat in the sky. Servants occasionally passed by to see if he needed anything. They seemed worried about him.</p>
<p class="para">He just wanted to watch the sky. It had been weeks since he’d been able to do that. The air was cooling, but he left his coat off, hung over the back of the bench. The open air felt good—different, somehow, from the same air beneath a cloudy sky.</p>
<p class="para">With the last light of dusk fading, the stars shone like hesitant children, peeking out now that the uproar of day had died down. It felt so good to finally see them again. Gawyn breathed in deeply.</p>
<p class="para">Elayne was right. Much of Gawyn’s hatred of al’Thor came from frustration. Maybe jealousy. Al’Thor was playing a role closer to what Gawyn would have chosen for himself. Ruling nations, leading armies. Looking at their lives, who had taken on the role of a prince, and who the role of a lost sheepherder?</p>
<p class="para">Perhaps Gawyn resisted Egwene’s demands because he wanted to lead, to be the one who accomplished the heroic acts. If he became her Warder, he would have to step aside and help <span class="italic1">her</span> change the world. There was honor in keeping someone great alive. A deep honor. What was the point of great acts? The recognition they brought, or the better lives they created?</p>
<p class="para">To step aside. He’d admired men like Sleete for their willingness to do this, but had never understood them. Not truly. <span class="italic1">I can’t leave her to do it alone,</span> he thought. <span class="italic1">I have to help her. From within her shadow.</span></p>
<p class="para">Because he loved her. But also because it was for the best. If two bards tried to play different songs at the same time, they both made noise. But if one stepped back to give harmony to the other’s melody, then the beauty could be greater than either made alone.</p>
<p class="para">And in that moment, finally, he understood. He stood up. He couldn’t go to Egwene as a prince. He had to go to her as a Warder. He had to watch over her, to serve her. See her wishes done.</p>
<p class="para">It was time to return.</p>
<p class="para">Slinging his coat on, he strode down the path toward the Palace. The opening serenades of various pond frogs cut short—followed by splashes—as he passed them and entered the building. It wasn’t a long walk to his sister’s rooms. She would be up; she had trouble sleeping lately. During the past few days, they had often enjoyed conversation and a cup of warm tea before bed. At her doors, however, he was stopped by Birgitte.</p>
<p class="para">She gave him another glare. Yes, she did <span class="italic1">not</span> like being forced to act as Captain-General in his stead. He could see that now. He felt a little awkward stepping up to her. The woman held up a hand. “Not tonight, princeling.”</p>
<p class="para">“I’m leaving for the White Tower,” he said. “I’d like to say farewell.”</p>
<p class="para">He moved to step forward, but Birgitte held a hand against his chest, gently pushing him back. “You can leave in the morning.”</p>
<p class="para">He almost reached for his sword, but stopped himself. Light! There had been a time when he hadn’t reacted that way to everything. He <span class="italic1">had</span> become a fool. “Ask if she’ll see me,” he said politely. “Please.”</p>
<p class="para">“I have my orders,” Birgitte said. “Besides, she couldn’t talk to you. She’s asleep.”</p>
<p class="para">“I’m sure she’d like to be awakened.”</p>
<p class="para">“It’s not that kind of sleep,” Birgitte said. She sighed. “It has to do with Aes Sedai matters. Go to bed. In the morning, your sister will probably have word from Egwene for you.”</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn frowned. How would…</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">The dreams,</span> he realized. <span class="italic1">This is what the Aes Sedai meant, about Egwene training them to walk in their dreams.</span> “So Egwene’s sleeping as well?”</p>
<p class="para">Birgitte eyed him. “Bloody ashes, I’ve probably said too much already. Off to your rooms.”</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn stepped away, but not to go to his rooms. <span class="italic1">He’ll wait for a time of weakness,</span> he thought, remembering the <span class="italic1">sul’dam</span>’s words. <span class="italic1">And when he strikes, he’ll leave such desolation as you wouldn’t believe a single man could create…</span></p>
<p class="para">A time of weakness.</p>
<p class="para">He dashed away from Elayne’s rooms, sprinting through the palace hallways to the Traveling room that Elayne had set up. Blessedly, a Kinswoman was on duty here—bleary-eyed, but waiting in case emergency messages needed to be sent. Gawyn didn’t recognize the dark-haired woman, but she seemed to recognize him.</p>
<p class="para">She yawned and opened a gateway at his request. He ran through and onto the Traveling ground of the White Tower. The gateway vanished right behind him. Gawyn started, spinning with a curse. That had nearly closed right on him! Why had the Kinswoman let it vanish so abruptly, and so dangerously? A split second sooner, and it would have taken his foot off, or worse.</p>
<p class="para">There was no time. He turned and continued running.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Egwene, Leane and the Wise Ones appeared in a room at the base of the Tower, where a group of anxious women waited. This was a guard post that Egwene had stipulated as a fallback position.</p>
<p class="para">“Report!” Egwene demanded.</p>
<p class="para">“Shevan and Carlinya are dead, Mother,” Saerin said grimly. The brusque Brown was panting.</p>
<p class="para">Egwene cursed. “What happened?”</p>
<p class="para">“We were in the middle of our ploy, having a discussion about a fake plot to bring peace to Arad Doman, as you’d ordered. And then…”</p>
<p class="para">“Fire,” Morvrin said, shivering. “Blasting through the walls. Women channeling, several with incredible Power. I saw Alviarin there. Others, too.”</p>
<p class="para">“Nynaeve is still up there,” Brendas added.</p>
<p class="para">“Stubborn woman,” Egwene said, looking at the three Wise Ones. They nodded. “Send Brendas out,” she said, pointing at the cool-eyed White. “When you wake, go and wake the others here so they will be out of danger. Leave Nynaeve, Siuan, Leane and myself.”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, Mother,” Brendas said.</p>
<p class="para">Amys did something that made her form fade away.</p>
<p class="para">“The rest of you,” Egwene said, “go someplace safe. Away from the city.”</p>
<p class="para">“Very well, Mother,” Saerin said. She stayed in place, however.</p>
<p class="para">“What?” Egwene said.</p>
<p class="para">“I…” Saerin frowned. “I can’t go. Something is odd.”</p>
<p class="para">“Nonsense,” Bair snapped. “It—”</p>
<p class="para">“Bair,” Amys said. “I can’t leave. Something is very wrong.”</p>
<p class="para">“The sky is violet,” Yukiri said, looking out a small window. “Light! It looks like a dome, covering the Tower and the city. When did that happen?”</p>
<p class="para">“Something is very wrong here,” Bair said. “We should awaken.”</p>
<p class="para">Amys suddenly vanished, causing Egwene to start. She was back in a moment. “I was able to go to the place where we were before, but I cannot leave the city. I do not like this, Egwene al’Vere.”</p>
<p class="para">Egwene tried sending herself to Cairhien. It didn’t work. She looked out the window, feeling worried, but resolute. Yes, there was violet above.</p>
<p class="para">“Wake if you must,” she said to the Wise Ones. “I will fight. One of the Shadowsouled is here.”</p>
<p class="para">The Wise Ones fell silent. “We will go with you,” Melaine finally said.</p>
<p class="para">“Good. You others, be away from this place. Go to the Musician’s Way and stay there until awakened. Melaine, Amys, Bair, Leane, we are going to a place higher in the Tower, a room with wood paneling and a four-poster bed, gauze drapings around it. It is my bedroom.”</p>
<p class="para">The Wise Ones nodded, and Egwene sent herself there. A lamp sat on her nightstand; it didn’t burn here in <span class="italic1">Tel’aran’rhiod</span>, though she’d left it burning in the real world. The Wise Ones and Leane appeared around her. The gauze draping Egwene’s bed ruffled in the breeze of their appearance.</p>
<p class="para">The Tower shook. The fighting continued.</p>
<p class="para">“Be careful,” Egwene said. “We hunt dangerous foes, and they know this terrain better than you.”</p>
<p class="para">“We will be careful,” Bair replied. “I have heard that the Shadowsouled think themselves masters of this place. Well, we shall see.”</p>
<p class="para">“Leane,” Egwene said, “can you handle yourself?” Egwene had been tempted to send her away, but she and Siuan had spent some measure of time in <span class="italic1">Tel’aran’rhiod</span>. Certainly, she was more experienced than most.</p>
<p class="para">“I’ll keep my head low, Mother,” she promised. “But there are bound to be more of them than us. You need me.”</p>
<p class="para">“Agreed,” Egwene said.</p>
<p class="para">The four women winked away. Why couldn’t they leave the Tower? It was troubling, but also useful. It would mean she was trapped here.</p>
<p class="para">But hopefully so was Mesaana.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Five doves rose into the air, scattering from the ledge of the rooftop. Perrin spun. Slayer stood behind him, smelling like stone.</p>
<p class="para">The hard-eyed man glanced up at the fleeing birds. “Yours?”</p>
<p class="para">“For warning,” Perrin replied. “I figured you’d see through walnut shells on the ground.”</p>
<p class="para">“Clever,” Slayer said.</p>
<p class="para">Behind him spread a magnificent city. Perrin hadn’t believed that any city could be as magnificent as Caemlyn. But if there was such a thing, Tar Valon was it. The entire city was a work of art, almost every building decked with archways, spires, engravings and ornamentation. Even the <span class="italic1">cobblestones</span> seemed to be arranged artistically.</p>
<p class="para">Slayer’s eyes flickered down to Perrin’s belt. There, affixed in a pouch Perrin had created to hold it, was the <span class="italic1">ter’angreal</span>. The tip stuck out the top, silvery bits wrapping around one another in a complex knotted braid. Perrin had tried again to destroy the thing by thinking of it, but had been rebuffed. Attacking it with his hammer hadn’t so much as bent it. Whatever this thing was, it had been built to resist such attacks.</p>
<p class="para">“You’ve grown skilled,” Slayer said. “I should have killed you months ago.”</p>
<p class="para">“I believe you tried,” Perrin said, raising his hammer, resting it on his shoulder. “Who are you really?”</p>
<p class="para">“A man of two worlds, Perrin Aybara. And one owned by both. I’ll need the dreamspike back.”</p>
<p class="para">“Step closer, and I’ll destroy it,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para">Slayer snorted, walking forward. “You don’t have the strength for that, boy. I don’t even have the strength to manage that.” His eyes flickered unconsciously over Perrin’s shoulder. Toward what?</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Dragonmount,</span> Perrin thought. <span class="italic1">He must have worried I was coming this way to toss it in.</span> Was that, then, an indication of a way Perrin could destroy the <span class="italic1">ter’angreal</span>? Or was Slayer trying to mislead him?</p>
<p class="para">“Don’t press me, boy,” Slayer said, sword and knife appearing in his hands as he walked forward. “I’ve already killed four wolves today. Give me the spike.”</p>
<p class="para">Four? But he’d killed only one that Perrin had seen. <span class="italic1">He’s trying to goad me.</span></p>
<p class="para">“You think I’ll believe that you won’t kill me if I give it to you?” Perrin said. “If I gave this to you, you’d have to go put it back in Ghealdan. You know I’d just follow you there.” Perrin shook his head. “One of us has to die, and that’s that.”</p>
<p class="para">Slayer hesitated, then smiled. “Luc hates you, you know. Hates you deeply.”</p>
<p class="para">“And you don’t?” Perrin asked, frowning.</p>
<p class="para">“No more than the wolf hates the stag.”</p>
<p class="para">“You are <span class="italic1">not</span> a wolf,” Perrin said, growling softly.</p>
<p class="para">Slayer shrugged. “Let us be done with this, then.” He dashed forward.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Gawyn charged into the White Tower; the men on guard barely had time to salute. He dashed past mirrored stand-lamps. Only one in every two was lit, to conserve oil. As he reached a ramp upward, he heard feet behind him.</p>
<p class="para">His sword hissed as he pulled it free, spinning. Mazone and Celark pulled to a halt. The former Younglings wore Tower Guard uniforms now. Would they try to stop him? Who knew what kind of orders Egwene had left?</p>
<p class="para">They saluted.</p>
<p class="para">“Men?” Gawyn said. “What are you doing?”</p>
<p class="para">“Sir,” Celark said, lean face shadowed in the patchy lamplight. “When an officer runs by with a look like that on his face, you don’t ask if he needs help. You just follow!”</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn smiled. “Come on.” He dashed up the ramps, the two men following, swords at the ready.</p>
<p class="para">Egwene’s quarters were some way up, and Gawyn’s pulse was racing—his breathing forced—by the time they reached her level. They hurried down three hallways; then Gawyn held up his hand. He glanced at the nearby shadowed recesses. Were any of them deep enough to hide a Bloodknife?</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">You cannot have light without shadow…</span></p>
<p class="para">He peeked around the corner toward Egwene’s door; he stood in virtually the same position he had been when he had ruined her plans before. Was he doing the same thing now? His two guardsmen stood up close behind him, waiting on his command.</p>
<p class="para">Yes. He was doing the same thing as before. And yet, something had changed. He <span class="italic1">would</span> see her protected so that she could do great things. He would stand in her shadow and be proud. He would do as she asked—but would see her safe no matter what.</p>
<p class="para">Because that was what a Warder did.</p>
<p class="para">He slipped forward, waving his men to follow. The darkness in that shadowy alcove from before didn’t seem to <span class="italic1">repel</span> his attention as it had last time. A good sign. He stopped at the door and tried it carefully. It was unlocked. He took a deep breath, then slipped inside.</p>
<p class="para">No alarms went off; no traps caught him and flung him about. A few lamps shone on the walls. At a faint noise, he looked upward. A Tower maid hung there, struggling, with wide eyes, mouth gagged by an invisible flow of Air.</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn cursed, dashing across the room, and threw open the door to Egwene’s sleeping chamber. Her bed, one side against the far wall, was draped with white gauze curtains, and a lamp burned on the stand beside it. Gawyn crossed the room to her, pushing the gauze aside. Was she sleeping? Or was she…</p>
<p class="para">He reached a hand toward her neck, but at a faint thump behind, Gawyn whipped his sword around and blocked the strike coming at his back. Not one, but <span class="italic1">two</span> blurs of darkness leaped from the shadows. He spared a glance for Egwene; there was no blood, but he couldn’t tell if she was breathing or not. Had his entrance interrupted the assassins in time?</p>
<p class="para">There was no time to check. He fell into Apple Blossoms in the Wind and began to shout. His men stepped up to the doorway, then froze there, stunned.</p>
<p class="para">“Get more help!” Gawyn said. “Go!”</p>
<p class="para">Dark-skinned Mazone turned to obey while Celark, looking determined, leaped into the fight.</p>
<p class="para">The Bloodknives shifted and undulated. Gawyn managed to slip into Cat on Hot Sand to test them, but each strike hit only air. His eyes were already hurting from trying to follow the figures.</p>
<p class="para">Celark attacked from behind, but was as ineffective as Gawyn. Gawyn gritted his teeth, fighting with his back against the bed. He had to keep them away from Egwene, long enough for help to come. If he could—</p>
<p class="para">Both figures twisted suddenly, striking in tandem at Celark. The man barely had time to curse before a sword took him in the neck, and bright blood spurted out. Gawyn yelled again, falling into Lizard in the Thornbush, striking at the backs of the assassins.</p>
<p class="para">Again, his attacks missed. It seemed he was off by only a few hairs. Celark stumbled to the floor with a gurgle, his blood reflecting lanternlight, and Gawyn couldn’t step forward to defend him. Not without exposing Egwene.</p>
<p class="para">One of the assassins turned back to Gawyn while the other beheaded Celark, with a slash that—despite the shadows—looked a lot like The River Undercuts the Bank. Gawyn stepped back, trying to keep his eyes off the fallen man. Defend. He only had to defend until help came! He edged to the side.</p>
<p class="para">The Seanchan were wary; they knew he’d fought one of them off before. But they had such a strong advantage. Gawyn wasn’t certain he could stand against two of them.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Yes you will,</span> he told himself sternly. <span class="italic1">If you fall, Egwene dies.</span></p>
<p class="para">Was that a flicker of movement from the other room? Could help have come? Gawyn felt a surge of hope, and edged to the side. From there, he could see Mazone’s body on the floor, bleeding.</p>
<p class="para">A third shadowed figure glided into the room and shut the door behind, locking it. That was why the other two had been hesitating. They’d wanted to wait until their ally arrived.</p>
<p class="para">The three of them attacked together.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Perrin let the wolf free.</p>
<p class="para">For once, he didn’t worry about what it would do to him. He let himself <span class="italic1">be</span>, and as he fought, the world seemed to become right around him.</p>
<p class="para">Perhaps that was because it bent to his will.</p>
<p class="para">Young Bull leaped from a rooftop in Tar Valon, powerful hind legs springing him into the air, <span class="italic1">ter’angreal</span> pouch fastened to his back. He soared over a street and landed on a white marble roof with groups of statues on its edges. He rolled, coming up as a man—<span class="italic1">ter’angreal</span> tied at his waist—with hammer swinging.</p>
<p class="para">Slayer vanished right before the hammer hit, then appeared beside Perrin. Perrin vanished as Slayer swung, then appeared just to the left. Back and forth they went, spinning around one another, each disappearing then appearing again, struggling to land a blow.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin threw himself out of the cycle, sending himself to a place beside one of the roof’s large statues, a pompous-looking general. He swung, smashing his hammer into it, magnifying the power of the blow. Chunks of statue exploded toward Slayer. The wolf-killer appeared, expecting to find Perrin beside him. Instead, a storm of stone and dust crashed into him.</p>
<p class="para">Slayer bellowed, stone chips slicing his skin. His cloak immediately became as strong as steel, reflecting chunks of stone. He whipped it back and the entire building started to shake. Perrin cursed and leaped free as the roof fell in.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin soared, becoming a wolf before landing on a nearby rooftop. Slayer appeared in front of him, bow drawn. Young Bull growled, imagining the wind blowing, but Slayer didn’t fire. He just stood there, as if—</p>
<p class="para">As if he were just a statue.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin cursed, spinning as an arrow shot past him, narrowly missing him at the waist. The real Slayer stood a short distance off; he vanished, leaving the remarkably detailed statue he’d created to distract Perrin.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin took a deep breath and made the sweat leave his brow. Slayer could come at him from any direction. He put a wall at his back and stood carefully, scanning the rooftop. The dome shook overhead. He’d grown used to that—it moved with him.</p>
<p class="para">But he <span class="italic1">wasn’t moving</span>.</p>
<p class="para">He looked down with a panic. The pouch was gone—the arrow Slayer had fired at his waist had sliced it free. Perrin dashed forward to the edge of the roof. Below, Slayer ran through the street, the pouch in his hand.</p>
<p class="para">A wolf leaped from an alley, crashing into Slayer, tossing him to the ground. Hopper.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin was there in a moment, attacking. Slayer cursed, vanishing from underneath Hopper and appearing at the end of the street. He began to flee, leaving a blur behind him.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin followed, Hopper joining him. <span class="italic1">How did you find me?</span> Perrin sent.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">You are two foolish cubs,</span> Hopper sent. <span class="italic1">Very loud. Like snarling cats. Easy to find.</span></p>
<p class="para">He’d deliberately not shown Hopper where he was. After seeing Oak Dancer die…well, this was Perrin’s fight. Now that the <span class="italic1">ter’angreal</span> was away from Ghealdan and his people were escaping, he didn’t want to risk the lives of other wolves.</p>
<p class="para">Not that Hopper would go if he told him to. Growling again, Perrin barreled after Slayer, wolf at his side.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Egwene crouched beside the wall of the hallway, panting, sweat dripping from her brow. Across from her, molten drops of rock cooled from a blast of fire.</p>
<p class="para">The Tower hallway fell still. A few lamps flickered on the wall. Through a window, she could see the purple sky above, between the Tower and the dark clouds. She’d been fighting for what seemed like hours, though it had probably been only fifteen minutes. She’d lost track of the Wise Ones.</p>
<p class="para">She began to creep forward, using the anti-eavesdropping weave to make her footfalls silent until she reached a corner and peered around it. Darkness in both directions. Egwene crept forward, moving carefully, resolutely. The Tower was her domain. She felt invaded, as surely as when the Seanchan had come. However, this fight was proving very different from fighting off the Seanchan. Then, the enemy had been bold, easy to spot.</p>
<p class="para">Faint light appeared under a doorway ahead. She shifted herself into the room, preparing weaves. Two women were there, speaking in whispers, one holding a globe of light. Evanellein and Mestra, two of the Black sisters who had fled the White Tower.</p>
<p class="para">Egwene let loose with a ball of fire that destroyed Mestra in an inferno. Evanellein yelped, and Egwene used a trick Nynaeve had taught her—she <span class="italic1">imagined</span> Evanellein being stupid, unable to think, unable to react.</p>
<p class="para">The woman’s eyes glazed over, and her mouth opened. Thought was faster than weaves. Egwene hesitated. Now what? Kill her, while defenseless? Her stomach turned at that thought. <span class="italic1">I could take her captive. Go and—</span></p>
<p class="para">Someone appeared in the room with her. The newcomer wore black, a magnificent gown with silver trim. Darkness swirled about her, made of spinning ribbons of cloth, her skirt rippling. The effect was unnatural and impressive; possible only here in <span class="italic1">Tel’aran’rhiod</span>.</p>
<p class="para">Egwene looked into the woman’s eyes. Large and blue, set in an angular face with chin-length black hair. There was a power to those eyes, and Egwene immediately knew what she was facing. Why fight? She couldn’t—</p>
<p class="para">Egwene felt her mind change, become accepting. She fought it with a burst of panic, and in a moment of clarity, she sent herself away.</p>
<p class="para">Egwene appeared in her rooms, then raised her hand to her head, sitting down on the bed. Light, but that woman had been strong.</p>
<p class="para">Something sounded behind her; someone appearing in the room. Egwene leaped to her feet, preparing weaves. Nynaeve stood there, eyes wide with fury. The woman thrust her hands forward, weaves forming, but she froze.</p>
<p class="para">“To the gardens,” Egwene said, not trusting her quarters. She shouldn’t have come here; Mesaana would know this place.</p>
<p class="para">Nynaeve nodded, and Egwene vanished, appearing in the lower Tower garden. The strange violet dome extended above. What <span class="italic1">was</span> that, and how had Mesaana brought it here? Nynaeve appeared a moment later.</p>
<p class="para">“They’re still up there,” Nynaeve whispered. “I just saw Alviarin.”</p>
<p class="para">“I saw Mesaana,” Egwene said. “She nearly took me.”</p>
<p class="para">“Light! Are you all right?”</p>
<p class="para">Egwene nodded. “Mestra is dead. I saw Evanellein, too.”</p>
<p class="para">“It’s black as a tomb up there,” Nynaeve whispered. “I think they made it that way. They shouldn’t be able to channel this well with those imperfect copies. Siuan and Leane are all right; I saw them a little bit ago, sticking together. Just before that, I managed to hit Notori with a blast of fire. She’s dead.”</p>
<p class="para">“Good. The Black Ajah stole nineteen <span class="italic1">ter’angreal</span>. That might give us an estimate of how many Black Ajah we have to contend with. Or since they're able to channel so strongly, perhaps not.” She, Siuan, Nynaeve, Leane and the three Wise Ones were outnumbered—but the Black Ajah didn’t seem to have much experience with <span class="italic1">Tel’aran’rhiod</span>.</p>
<p class="para">“Have you seen the Wise Ones?”</p>
<p class="para">“They’re up there.” Nynaeve grimaced. “They seem to be enjoying this.”</p>
<p class="para">“They would,” Egwene said. “I want you and me to go together. We will appear in intersections, back to back, and quickly scan for light or people. If you see a Black, strike. If someone sees you, say ‘Go’ and we’ll jump back here.”</p>
<p class="para">Nynaeve nodded.</p>
<p class="para">“First intersection is the one outside my room,” Egwene said. “Hallway on the south side. I’ll flood it with light; you be ready. From there, we’ll jump down one hallway, by the door into the servants’ ramp. Then on down the line.”</p>
<p class="para">Nynaeve nodded sharply.</p>
<p class="para">The world winked around Egwene. She appeared in the hallway, and immediately thought of the place lit, imposing her will upon it. Light flooded the entire space. A round-faced woman crouched near the side of the wall, wearing white. Sedore, one of the Black sisters.</p>
<p class="para">Sedore spun, looking angry, weaves springing up around her. Egwene worked faster, creating a column of fire right before Sedore would have released her own. No weaves on Egwene’s part. Just the fire.</p>
<p class="para">Egwene saw the Black’s eyes open wider as the fire roared around her. Sedore screeched, but that cut off as the heat consumed her. Her burned corpse collapsed to the floor, smoldering.</p>
<p class="para">Egwene let out a relieved breath. “Anyone on your side?”</p>
<p class="para">“No,” Nynaeve said. “Who was that you hit?”</p>
<p class="para">“Sedore.”</p>
<p class="para">“Really?” Nynaeve said, turning. She had been a Sitter for the Yellow.</p>
<p class="para">Egwene smiled. “Next hallway.”</p>
<p class="para">They jumped, and repeated their strategy, flooding the hallway with light. There was nobody there, so they moved on. The next two hallways were empty. Egwene was about to leave when a voice hissed, “Foolish child! Your pattern is obvious.”</p>
<p class="para">Egwene spun. “Where…”</p>
<p class="para">She cut off as she saw Bair. The aged Wise One had changed her clothing and even her <span class="italic1">skin itself</span> to match the white walls and floor tiles. She was practically invisible, crouching in an alcove.</p>
<p class="para">“You shouldn’t—” Bair began.</p>
<p class="para">A wall beside them exploded outward, throwing up chunks of rock. Six women stood beyond, and they released weaves of Fire.</p>
<p class="para">It appeared that the time for sneaking had ended.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Perrin crested the wall surrounding the White Tower grounds, coming down with a thump. The strangeness of the wolf dream continued; he now not only smelled odd scents, but heard odd sounds as well. Rumblings from inside the Tower.</p>
<p class="para">He leaped after Slayer, who crossed the grounds, then ran up the outside of the Tower itself. Perrin followed, running up into the air. Slayer stayed just ahead, <span class="italic1">ter’angreal</span> pouch tied at his waist.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin created a longbow. He pulled it back, freezing in place, standing on the side of the Tower. He loosed, but the wolf-killer leaped up, then fell into the Tower through a window. The arrow passed overhead.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin leaped to the window, then ducked inside, Hopper leaping in after him, leaving a blur behind. They entered a bedroom hung with brocades of blue. The door slammed, and Perrin charged after Slayer. He didn’t bother to open the door; he smashed it with his hammer.</p>
<p class="para">Slayer charged down a hallway.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Follow,</span> Perrin sent to Hopper. <span class="italic1">I’ll cut him off.</span></p>
<p class="para">The wolf raced forward, after Slayer. Perrin ran to the right, then cut down a hallway. He moved quickly, the walls speeding past.</p>
<p class="para">He passed a hallway that appeared to be full of people. He was so surprised that he froze, the hall lurching around him.</p>
<p class="para">They were <span class="italic1">Aes Sedai</span>, and they were fighting. The hallway was alight, trails of fire flying from one end to the other. The sounds he’d heard before hadn’t been phantoms. And, he thought, yes…</p>
<p class="para">“Egwene?” Perrin asked.</p>
<p class="para">She stood pressed against the wall nearby, intently looking down the hallway. When he spoke, she spun on him, hands going up. He felt something grab him. His mind instantly reacted, however, pushing the air away.</p>
<p class="para">Egwene started as she failed to snatch him.</p>
<p class="para">He stepped forward. “Egwene, you shouldn’t be here. This place is dangerous.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">“Perrin?”</span></p>
<p class="para">“I don’t know how you got here,” Perrin said. “But you need to go. Please.”</p>
<p class="para">“How did you stop me?” she demanded. “What are you doing here? Have you been with Rand? Tell me where he is.”</p>
<p class="para">She spoke with such authority now. She almost seemed a different person, decades older than the girl he’d known. Perrin opened his mouth to reply, but Egwene cut him off.</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t have time for this,” she said. “I’m sorry, Perrin. I’ll be back for you.” She raised a hand, and he felt things change around him. Ropes appeared, binding him.</p>
<p class="para">He looked down, amused. The ropes slipped free the moment he thought of them being too loose.</p>
<p class="para">Egwene blinked, watching them drop to the ground. “How—”</p>
<p class="para">Someone burst out of a room nearby, a tall, slender-necked woman with raven hair, wearing a sleek white dress. She smiled, raising her hands, and a light appeared before her.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin didn’t need to know what she was doing. He was a wolf; <span class="italic1">he</span> was the ruler of this place. Weaves were meaningless. He imagined the woman’s attack missing him; he <span class="italic1">knew</span> it would be so.</p>
<p class="para">A bar of white-hot light shot from the woman. Perrin raised a hand before himself and Egwene. The light vanished, as if stopped by his palm.</p>
<p class="para">Egwene turned, and the wall above the woman burst, rock showering down. A chunk smashed the woman on the head brutally, knocking her to the ground. Light, she was probably dead, after a blow like that.</p>
<p class="para">Egwene smelled amazed. She spun on him. “Balefire? You stopped <span class="italic1">balefire</span>? <span class="italic1">Nothing</span> should be able to do that.”</p>
<p class="para">“It’s just a weave,” Perrin said, reaching out for Hopper. Where was Slayer?</p>
<p class="para">“It’s not <span class="italic1">just</span> a weave, Perrin, it’s—”</p>
<p class="para">“I’m sorry, Egwene,” he said. “I will speak to you later. Be careful in this place. You probably already know that you need to be, but still. It’s more dangerous than you know.”</p>
<p class="para">He turned and ran, leaving Egwene sputtering. It seemed she’d managed to become an Aes Sedai. That was good; she deserved it.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Hopper?</span> he sent. <span class="italic1">Where are you?</span></p>
<p class="para">His only reply was a sudden, terrifying, sending of pain.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Gawyn fought for his life against three living shadows of darkness and steel.</p>
<p class="para">They pressed him to the utmost of his ability, leaving him bloodied half a dozen times over on arms and legs. He used The Cyclone Rages, and it defended his vitals. Barely.</p>
<p class="para">Drops of his blood stained the gauze draping Egwene’s bed. If his opponents had already killed Egwene, then they made a good show of continuing to threaten her.</p>
<p class="para">He was growing weak and tired. His boots left bloody prints when he stepped. He couldn’t feel the pain. His parries were becoming sluggish. They’d have him in another moment or two.</p>
<p class="para">No help came, although his voice was hoarse from yelling. <span class="italic1">Fool!</span> he thought. <span class="italic1">You need to spend more time thinking and less time running straight into danger!</span> He should have alerted the entire Tower.</p>
<p class="para">The only reason he was alive was because the three were being careful, wearing him down. Once he fell, that <span class="italic1">sul’dam</span> had indicated they would go on a rampage through the White Tower. It would take the Aes Sedai completely by surprise. This night could be a disaster greater than the original Seanchan strike had been.</p>
<p class="para">The three moved forward.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">No!</span> Gawyn thought as one of them tried The River Undercuts the Bank. He leaped forward, dodging between two blades, swinging his weapon. Amazingly, he actually struck, and a voice cried out in the room. Blood sprayed across the ground, one shadowy form falling.</p>
<p class="para">The two others muttered curses, and all pretense of wearing him down vanished. They struck at him, weapons flashing amid dark mist. Exhausted, Gawyn took another hit on the shoulder, blood trickling down his arm beneath his coat.</p>
<p class="para">Shadows. How could a man be expected to fight against shadows? It was impossible!</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Where there is light, there must be shadow…</span></p>
<p class="para">A last, desperate thought occurred to him. With a cry, he leaped to the side and yanked a pillow from Egwene’s bed. Blades cut the air around him as he spun and slammed the pillow on the lantern, smothering it.</p>
<p class="para">Plunging the room into darkness. No light. No shadows.</p>
<p class="para">Equality.</p>
<p class="para">The darkness evened out everything, and in the night, you couldn’t see color. He couldn’t see the blood on his arms, couldn’t see the black shadows of his enemies or the whiteness of Egwene’s bed. But he could hear the men move.</p>
<p class="para">He raised his blade for a desperate strike, using Hummingbird Kisses the Honeyrose, predicting where the Bloodknives would move. He was no longer distracted by their misted figures, and his strike hit true, sinking into flesh.</p>
<p class="para">He twisted, yanking his blade free. The room fell silent save for the fall of the man he’d hit. Gawyn held his breath, heartbeat thumping in his ears. Where was the last assassin?</p>
<p class="para">No light came in from the room next door; Celark had fallen beside the doorway, blocking the light underneath.</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn was feeling shaky now. He’d lost too much blood. If he had something to throw to create a distraction…but no. Moving would rustle clothing, would give him away.</p>
<p class="para">So, gritting his teeth, he tapped his foot and raised his blade to protect his neck, praying to the Light that the attack came low.</p>
<p class="para">It did, cutting deeply into his side. He took it with a grunt, but immediately lashed out with all he had. His sword hissed, and with a brief tug it sliced true. A thump followed; a decapitated head bouncing off the wall, followed by the noise of a corpse hitting the ground.</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn slumped against the bed, blood gushing from his side. He was blacking out, although it was hard to tell in the unlit room.</p>
<p class="para">He reached for where he remembered Egwene’s hand being, but was too weak to find it.</p>
<p class="para">He hit the floor a moment later. His last thought was that he still didn’t know whether or not she was dead.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">“Great Mistress,” Katerine said, kneeling before Mesaana, “we cannot find the thing you describe. Half of our women search for it while the other half fight the worms who resist. But it is nowhere!”</p>
<p class="para">Mesaana folded her arms beneath her breasts as she considered the situation. With an offhanded thought, she strapped Katerine’s back with lines of Air. Failure needed always to be punished. Consistency was the key in all forms of training.</p>
<p class="para">The White Tower rumbled above her, though she was safe here. She’d imposed her will on this area, creating a new room beneath the basements, carved as a pocket in the stone. The children who fought above obviously thought themselves practiced in this place, but children they were. <span class="italic1">She</span> had been coming to <span class="italic1">Tel’aran’rhiod</span> for a century before her imprisonment.</p>
<p class="para">The Tower rumbled again. Carefully, she considered her situation. Somehow, the Aes Sedai had found a dreamspike. How had they located such a treasure? Mesaana was nearly as interested in gaining control of it as she was in dominating the child Amyrlin, Egwene al’Vere. The ability to forbid gateways into your places of refuge…Well, it was a vital tool, particularly when she decided to move against the other Chosen. It was more effective than wards, protecting one’s dreams from any intrusion, and it stopped all forms of Traveling in or out of the area except for those allowed.</p>
<p class="para">However, with the dreamspike in place, she <span class="italic1">also</span> could not move this battle with the children above to a more suitable, carefully selected location. Aggravating. But no, she would not allow herself to become emotional about the situation.</p>
<p class="para">“Return above and concentrate everything on capturing the woman Egwene al’Vere,” Mesaana said. “She will know where the device is.” Yes, that was clear to her now. She would achieve two victories with a single act.</p>
<p class="para">“Yes…Mistress…” Katerine was still cowering, straps of Air beating against her back. Ah, yes. Mesaana waved curtly, dispelling the weave. As she did so, a thought occurred to her.</p>
<p class="para">“Wait here, a moment,” she said to Katerine. “I’m going to place a weave upon you….”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Perrin appeared on the very top of the White Tower.</p>
<p class="para">Slayer held Hopper by the scruff of his neck. The wolf had an arrow through his side; blood ran down his paw. Wind blew across the rock, catching the blood and spraying it across the stones.</p>
<p class="para">“Hopper!” Perrin took a step forward. He could still sense Hopper’s mind, though it was weak.</p>
<p class="para">Slayer held the wolf up, lifting him easily. He raised a knife.</p>
<p class="para">“No,” Perrin said. “You have what you want. Just go.”</p>
<p class="para">“And what was it you said earlier?” Slayer asked. “That you know where I would go, and you’d follow? The dreamspike is too easy to locate on this side.”</p>
<p class="para">He casually tossed the wolf off the side of the Tower.</p>
<p class="para">“NO!” Perrin screamed. He leaped for the side, but Slayer appeared beside him, grabbing him, raising his dagger. The leap knocked them both off the side of the Tower, Perrin’s stomach lurching as they fell.</p>
<p class="para">He tried to send himself away, but Slayer had hold of him, and <span class="italic1">he</span> tried very hard to keep them in place. They shook for a moment, but kept falling.</p>
<p class="para">Slayer was so <span class="italic1">strong</span>. He smelled wrong, like staleness and wolf’s blood. His knife sought Perrin’s throat, and the best Perrin could do was raise his arm to block, thinking of his shirt being as hard as steel.</p>
<p class="para">Slayer pressed harder. Perrin felt a moment of weakness, the wound across his chest throbbing as he and Slayer tumbled. The knife split Perrin’s sleeve and rammed into his forearm.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin screamed. The wind was so loud. It had been mere seconds. Slayer pulled the knife free.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Hopper!</span></p>
<p class="para">Perrin roared and kicked at Slayer, pushing him away, breaking his grip. Arm aflame, Perrin twisted in the air. The ground rushed at them. He <span class="italic1">willed</span> himself to another place, and he appeared just below Hopper, catching the wolf and crashing into the ground. His knees buckled; the ground around him shattered. But he lowered Hopper safely.</p>
<p class="para">A black-fletched arrow zipped from the sky and pierced Hopper’s back, passing all the way through the wolf and hitting Perrin in his thigh, which was bent at the knee just beneath the wolf.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin yelled, feeling his own pain mix with a sudden wash of agony from Hopper. The wolf’s mind was fading.</p>
<p class="para">“No!” Perrin sent, eyes wet with tears.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Young Bull…</span> Hopper sent.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin tried to send himself away, but his mind was fuzzy. Another arrow would soon fall. He knew it. He managed to roll out of the way as it struck the ground, but his leg no longer worked, and Hopper was so heavy. Perrin pitched to the ground, dropping the wolf, rolling.</p>
<p class="para">Slayer landed a short distance away, long, wicked black bow in hand. “Goodbye, Aybara.” Slayer raised his bow. “Looks like I kill <span class="italic1">five</span> wolves today.”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin stared up at the arrow. Everything was blurry.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">I can’t leave Faile. I can’t leave Hopper.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">I</span> won’t!</p>
<p class="para">As Slayer released, Perrin desperately imagined himself strong, not faint. He felt his heart become hale again, his veins filling with energy. He yelled, head clearing enough to make himself vanish and appear standing behind Slayer.</p>
<p class="para">He swung with his hammer.</p>
<p class="para">Slayer turned casually and blocked it with his arm, which was enormously strong. Perrin fell to one knee, the pain in his leg still there. He gasped.</p>
<p class="para">“You can’t heal yourself,” Slayer said. “There are ways, but simply imagining yourself well does not work. You do seem to have figured out how to replenish your blood, however, which is useful.”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin smelled something. Terror. Was it his own?</p>
<p class="para">No. No, <span class="italic1">there</span>. Behind Slayer was a doorway open into the White Tower. Inside was blackness. Not just shadow, <span class="italic1">blackness</span>. Perrin had done enough practice with Hopper to recognize what it was.</p>
<p class="para">A nightmare.</p>
<p class="para">As Slayer opened his mouth to say something, Perrin growled and threw all of his weight forward, ramming into Slayer. His leg screamed in pain.</p>
<p class="para">They tumbled directly into the blackness of the nightmare.</p>
