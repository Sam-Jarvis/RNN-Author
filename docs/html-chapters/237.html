<div class="subtitle-chapter"><span class="calibre2"><span class="calibre18">Out of the Stone</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">I</span>t was a strange procession Rand led out of the Stone and eastward, with white clouds shading the midday sun and a breath of air stirring across the city. By his order there had been no announcement, no proclamation, but slowly word spread of <span class="calibre18">something</span>: citizens stopped whatever they were doing and ran for vantage points. The Aiel were marching through the city, marching out of the city. People who had not seen them come in the night, who had only half-believed they were in the Stone at all, increasingly lined the streets along the route, filled the windows, even climbed onto slate rooftops, straddling roof peaks and upturned corners. Murmurs ran as they counted the Aiel. These few hundred could never have taken the Stone. The Dragon banner still flew above the fortress. There must yet be thousands of Aiel in there. And the Lord Dragon.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand rode easily in his shirtsleeves, sure none of the onlookers could take him for anyone out of the ordinary. An outlander, rich enough to ride—and on a superb dappled stallion, best of the Tairen bloodstock—a rich man traveling in the oddest of odd company, but surely just another man for that. Not even the leader of this strange company; that title was surely assigned to Lan or Moiraine despite the fact that they rode some little distance behind him, directly ahead of the Aiel. The soft awed susurration that accompanied his passing certainly rose for the Aiel, not him. These Tairen folk might even take him for a groom, riding his master’s
horse. Well, no, not that; not out in front as he was. It was a fine day, anyway. Not sweltering, merely warm. No one expected him to mete out justice, or rule a nation. He could simply enjoy riding in anonymity, enjoy the rare breeze. For a time he could forget the feel of his heron-branded palms on the reins. <span class="calibre18">For a little longer anyway</span>, he thought. <span class="calibre18">A little longer.</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Rand,” Egwene said, “do you really think it was right to let the Aiel take all those things?” He looked around as she heeled her gray mare, Mist, up beside him. From somewhere she had gotten a dark green dress with narrow divided skirts, and a green velvet band held her hair at the nape of her neck.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine and Lan still hung back half a dozen strides, she on her white mare in a full-skirted blue silk riding dress slashed with green, her dark hair caught in a golden net, he astride his great black warhorse, in a color-shifting Warder’s cloak that probably brought as many <span class="calibre18">oohs</span> and <span class="calibre18">aahs</span> as the Aiel. When the breeze stirred the cloak, shades of green and brown and gray rippled across it; when it hung still it somehow seemed to fade into whatever was beyond it, so the eye appeared to be seeing <span class="calibre18">through</span> parts of Lan and his mount. It was not comfortable to look at.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Mat was there, too, slumped in his saddle and looking resigned, trying to keep apart from the Warder and Aes Sedai. He had chosen a nondescript brown gelding, an animal he called Pips; it took a good eye to notice the deep chest and strong withers that promised blunt-nosed Pips could likely match Rand’s stallion or Lan’s for speed and endurance. Mat’s decision to come had been a surprise; Rand still did not know why. Friendship, maybe, and then again, maybe not. Mat could be odd in what he did and why.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Didn’t your friend Aviendha explain to you about  ‘the fifth’?” he asked.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“She mentioned something, but . . . . Rand, you don’t think she . . . <span class="calibre18">took</span> . . . things, too?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Behind Moiraine and Lan, behind Mat, behind Rhuarc at their head, the Aiel walked in long lines to either side of loaded pack mules, rank on rank four abreast. When Aiel took one of the holds of an enemy clan in the Waste, by custom—or maybe law; Rand did not understand it exactly—they carried away one-fifth of all it contained, excepting only food. They had seen no reason not to treat the Stone the same. Not that the mules held more than the barest fraction of a fraction of a fifth of the Stone’s treasures. Rhuarc said greed had killed more men than steel. The wickerwork pack hampers, topped with rolled carpets and wall hangings, were lightly laden.
Ahead lay an eventual hard crossing of the Spine of the World, and then a far harder trek across the Waste.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">When do I tell them?</span> he wondered. <span class="calibre18">Soon, now; it has to be soon.</span> Moiraine would doubtless think it daring, a bold stroke; she might even approve. Maybe. She thought she knew his whole plan, now, and made no bones of disapproving that; no doubt she wanted it over and done as soon as possible. But the Aiel . . . . <span class="calibre18">What if they refuse? Well, if they refuse, they refuse. I have to do it.</span> As for the fifth . . . . He did not think it would have been possible to stop the Aiel from taking it even had he wanted to, and he had not; they had earned their rewards, and he had no care to help Tairen lords keep what they had wrung from their people over generations.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I saw her showing Rhuarc a silver bowl,” he said aloud. “From the way her sack clinked when she stuffed the bowl in, there was more silver in there. Or maybe gold. Do you disapprove?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“No.” She drew the word out slowly, with a touch of doubt, but then her voice firmed. “I just hadn’t thought of her . . . . The Tairens would not have stopped at a fifth if the positions had been reversed. They’d have carted away whatever wasn’t part of the stonework, and stolen all the carts to haul it. Just because a people’s ways are different doesn’t mean they are wrong, Rand. You should know that.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He laughed softly. This was almost like old times, he ready to explain why and how she was wrong, and she snatching his position and tossing his own unvoiced explanation at him. His stallion danced a few steps, catching his mood. He patted the dapple’s arched neck. A good day.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“That’s a fine horse,” she said. “What have you named him?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Jeade’en,” he said cautiously, losing some of his good spirits. He was a little ashamed of the name, of his reasons for choosing it. One of his favorite books had always been <span class="calibre18">The Travels of Jain Farstrider</span>, and that great traveler had named his horse Jeade’en—True Finder, in the Old Tongue—because the animal had always been able to find the way home. It would have been nice to think Jeade’en might carry him home one day. Nice, but not likely, and he did not want anyone suspecting the cause for the name. Boyish fancies had no place in his life now. There was not much room for anything but what he had to do.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“A fine name,” she said absently. He knew she had read the book, too, and half-expected her to recognize the name, but she seemed to be mulling over something else, chewing her lower lip pensively.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He was content with silence. The last dregs of the city gave way to
country and pitiful scattered farms. Not even a Congar or a Coplin, Two River folk notorious for laziness among other things, would keep a place as run-down and ramshackle as these rough stone houses, walls slanting as if about to topple over on the chickens scratching in the dirt. Sagging barns leaned against laurels or spicewoods. Roofs of cracked and broken slates all looked as if they leaked. Goats bleated disconsolately in stone pens that might have been thrown together hastily that morning. Barefoot men and women hoed stoop-shouldered in unfenced fields, not looking up even when the large party was passing. Redbeaks and thrushes warbling in the small thickets were not enough to lighten the feel of oppressive gloom.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">I have to do something about this. I . . . . No, not now. First things first. I’ve done what I could for them in a few weeks. I can’t do anything more now.</span> He tried not to look at the tumbledown farms. Were the olive groves in the south as bad? The people who worked those did not even own the land; it all belonged to High Lords. <span class="calibre18">No. The breeze. Nice, the way it cuts the heat. I can enjoy it a bit longer. I have to tell them, soon now.</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Rand,” Egwene said abruptly, “I want to talk to you.” Something serious by her expression; those big dark eyes, fixed on him, held a light reminiscent of Nynaeve’s when she was about to lecture. “I want to talk about Elayne.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What about her?” he asked warily. He touched his pouch, where two letters crinkled against a small hard object. If they had not both been in the same elegantly flowing hand, he would not have believed they came from the same woman. And after all that kissing and snuggling. The High Lords were easier to understand than women.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Why did you let her go in that way?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Puzzled, he stared at her. “She wanted to go. I’d have had to tie her up to stop her. Besides, she’ll be safer in Tanchico than near me—or Mat—if we are going to attract bubbles of evil the way Moiraine says. You would be, too.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“That isn’t what I mean at all. Of course she wanted to go. And you had no right to stop her. But why didn’t you tell her you wished she would stay?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“She wanted to go,” he repeated, and grew more confused when she rolled her eyes as if he were speaking gibberish. If he had no right to stop Elayne, and she wanted to go, why was he supposed to try to talk her out of it? Especially when she was safer gone.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine spoke, right behind him. “Are you ready to tell me the next
secret? It has been clear you were keeping something from me. At the least I might be able to tell you if you are leading us over a cliff.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand sighed. He had not heard her and Lan closing up on him. And Mat as well, although still holding a distance between himself and the Aes Sedai. Mat’s face was a study, doubt and reluctance and grim determination all running across it by turns, especially when he glanced at Moiraine. He never looked at her directly, only from the edge of his eye.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Are you sure you want to come, Mat?” Rand asked.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Mat shrugged and affected a grin, not a very confident one. “Who could pass up a chance to see bloody Rhuidean?” Egwene raised her eyebrows at him. “Oh, pardon my language, <span class="calibre18">Aes Sedai.</span> I’ve heard you say as bad, and for less cause, I’ll wager.” Egwene stared at him indignantly, but spots of color in her cheeks said he had scored a hit.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Be glad Mat <span class="calibre18">is</span> here,” Moiraine said to Rand, her voice cool, and not pleased. “You made a grave error letting Perrin run off, hiding his going from me. The world rests on your shoulders, but they must both support you or you will fall, and the world with you.” Mat flinched, and Rand thought he very nearly turned his gelding and rode away on the spot.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I know my duty,” he told her. <span class="calibre18">And I know my fate</span>, he thought, but he did not say that aloud; he was not asking sympathy. “One of us had to go back, Moiraine, and Perrin wanted to. You’re willing to let anything go to save the world. I . . . I do what I have to.” The Warder nodded, though he said nothing; Lan would not disagree with Moiraine in front of others.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“And the next secret?” she said insistently. She would not give up until she had ferreted it out, and he had no reason to keep it secret any longer. Not this part of it.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Portal Stones,” he said simply. “If we are lucky.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Oh, Light!” Mat groaned. “Bloody flaming Light! Don’t grimace at me, Egwene! Lucky? Isn’t once enough, Rand? You almost killed us, remember? No, worse than killed. I would rather ride back to one of those farms and ask for a job slopping pigs the rest of my life.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You can go your own way if you want, Mat,” Rand told him. Moiraine’s calm face was a mask over fury, but he ignored the icy stare that tried to still his tongue. Even Lan looked disapproving, for all his hard face did not change very much; the Warder believed in duty before anything else. Rand would do his duty, but his friends . . . . He did not like making people do things; he would not do it to his friends. That much he could avoid, surely. “You’ve no reason to come to the Waste.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Oh, yes I do. At least . . . . Oh, burn me! I’ve one life to give away,
don’t I? Why not like this?” Mat laughed nervously, and a bit wildly. “Bloody Portal Stones! Light!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand frowned; he was the one they all said was supposed to go mad, but Mat was the one who seemed on the edge of it now.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene blinked at Mat worriedly, but it was Rand she leaned toward. “Rand, Verin Sedai told me a little about Portal Stones. She told me about the . . . journey you took. Do you really mean to do this?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It’s what I have to do, Egwene.” He had to move quickly, and there was no quicker way than Portal Stones. Remnants of an Age older than the Age of Legends; even Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends had not understood them, it seemed. But there was no quicker way. If it worked the way he hoped.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine had listened to the exchange patiently. Especially to Mat’s part of it, though Rand could not see why. Now she said, “Verin also told me of your journey using Portal Stones. That was only a few people and horses, not hundreds, and if you did not almost kill everyone as Mat says, it yet sounded an experience no one would wish to repeat. Nor did it turn out as you expected. It also required a great deal of the Power; almost enough to kill you at least, Verin said. Even if you leave most of the Aiel behind, do you dare risk the attempt?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I have to,” he said, feeling at his belt pouch, at the small hard shape behind the letters, but she went right on as if he had not spoken.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Are you even certain there <span class="calibre18">is</span> a Portal Stone in the Waste? Verin certainly knows more of them than I, but I have never heard of one. If there is, will it place us any closer to Rhuidean than we are right now?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Some six hundred or so years ago,” he told her, “a peddler tried to get a look at Rhuidean.” Another time it would have been a pleasure to be able to lecture her for a change. Not today. There was too much he did not know. “This fellow apparently didn’t see anything of it; he claimed to have seen a golden city up in the clouds, drifting over the mountains.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“There are no cities in the Waste,” Lan said, “in the clouds or on the ground. I’ve fought the Aiel. They have no cities.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene nodded. “Aviendha told me she had never seen a city until she left the Waste.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Maybe so,” Rand said. “But the peddler also saw something sticking out of the side of one of those mountains. A Portal Stone. He described it perfectly. There isn’t anything else like a Portal Stone. When I described one to the chief librarian in the Stone . . .” Without naming what he was after, he did not add. “ . . . he recognized it, even if he didn’t know what it was, enough to show me four on an old map of Tear—”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Four?” Moiraine sounded startled. “All in Tear? Portal Stones are not so common as that.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Four,” Rand said definitely. The bony old librarian had been certain, even digging out a tattered yellowed manuscript telling of efforts to move the “unknown artifacts of an earlier Age” to the Great Holding. Every attempt had failed, and the Tairens had finally given up. That was confirmation to Rand; Portal Stones resisted being moved. “One lies not an hour’s ride from where we are,” he continued. “The Aiel allowed the peddler to leave, since he was a peddler. With one of his mules and as much water as he could carry on his back. Somehow he made it as far as a <span class="calibre18">stedding</span> in the Spine of the World, where he met a man named Soran Milo, who was writing a book called <span class="calibre18">The Killers of the Black Veil.</span> The librarian brought me a battered copy when I asked for books on the Aiel. Milo apparently based it all on Aiel who came to trade at the <span class="calibre18">stedding</span>, and he got almost everything wrong anyway, according to Rhuarc, but a Portal Stone can’t be anything but a Portal Stone.” He had examined other maps and manuscripts, dozens of them, supposedly studying Tear and its history, learning the land; <span class="calibre18">no</span> one could have had a clue what he intended before a few minutes ago.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine sniffed, and her white mare, Aldieb, frisked a few steps, picking up her irritation. “A supposed story told by a supposed peddler who claimed to have seen a golden city floating in the clouds. Has Rhuarc seen this Portal Stone? He has actually been to Rhiudean. Even if this peddler did go into the Waste, and did see a Portal Stone, it could have been anywhere. A man telling a story usually tries to better what really happened. A city floating in the clouds?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“How do you know it doesn’t?” he said. Rhuarc had been willing to laugh at all the wrong things Milo had written about Aiel, but he had not been very forthcoming about Rhuidean. No, more than that; or less, rather. The Aielman had refused even to comment on the parts of the book supposedly about Rhuidean. Rhuidean, in the lands of the Jenn Aiel, the clan which is not; that was almost the extent of what Rhuarc would say about it. Rhuidean was not to be spoken of.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Aes Sedai was not best pleased with his flippant remark, but he did not care. She had kept too many secrets herself, made him follow her on blind trust too often. Let it be her turn. She had to learn that he was not a puppet. <span class="calibre18">I’ll take her advice when I think it’s right, but I won’t dance on Tar Valon’s strings again.</span> He would die on his own terms.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene moved her gray horse closer, riding almost knee-to-knee with him. “Rand, do you really mean to risk our lives on a . . . a chance? Rhuarc
did not tell you anything, did he? When I ask Aviendha about Rhuidean, she shuts up tight as a hickory nut.” Mat looked sick.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand kept his face still, not letting his flash of shame show. He had not meant to frighten his friends. “There is a Portal Stone there,” he maintained. He rubbed the hard shape in his pouch again. This had to work.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The librarian’s maps had been old, but in a way that was a help. The grasslands they rode now had been forest when those maps were drawn, but few trees remained, far-scattered scraggly copses of white oak and pine and maidenhair, tall solitary trees he did not recognize, with gnarled spindly trunks. He could make out the shape of the land easily, hills shrouded mainly in high grass now.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">On the maps two tall bent ridges, one close behind the other, had pointed to the cluster of round hills where the Portal Stone was. If the maps had been well made. If the librarian really had recognized his description, and the green diamond mark actually meant ancient ruins as he claimed. <span class="calibre18">Why would he lie? I’m getting too suspicious. No, I have to be suspicious. As trusting as a viper, and as cold.</span> He did not like it, though.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">To the north he could just make out hills with no trees at all, speckled with moving shapes that must be horses. The High Lords’ herds, grazing across the site of the old Ogier grove. He hoped Perrin and Loial had gotten away safely. <span class="calibre18">Help them, Perrin</span>, he thought. <span class="calibre18">Help them somehow, because I can’t.</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Ogier grove meant the folded ridges must be close, and soon he spotted them a little to the south, like two arrows one inside the other, a few trees along the top making a thin line against the sky. Beyond, low round hills like grass-covered bubbles ran into one another. More hills than on the old map. Too many, for all the patch encompassed less than a square mile. If they did not correspond to the map, which one held the Portal Stone on its side?</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The Aiel have numbers,” Lan said quietly, “and sharp eyes.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">With a nod of gratitude, Rand reined Jeade’en in, falling back to put the problem before Rhuarc. He only described the Portal Stone, not saying what it was; there would be time enough for that when it was found. He was good at keeping secrets now. Rhuarc probably had no idea what a Portal Stone was, anyway. Few did except for Aes Sedai. He had not known until someone told him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Striding along beside the dapple stallion, the Aielman frowned slightly—as much as a worried grimace from most other men—then nodded. “We can find this thing.” He raised his voice. <span class="calibre18">“Aethan Dor! Far Alda-zar Din! Duadhe Mahdi’in! Far Dareis Mai! Seia Doon! Sha’mad Conde!”</span></span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">As he called out, members of the named warrior societies trotted forward, until a good quarter of the Aiel clustered around him and Rand. Red Shields. Brothers of the Eagle. Water Seekers. Maidens of the Spear. Black Eyes. Thunder Walkers.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand picked out Egwene’s friend, Aviendha, a tall, pretty woman with a haughty unsmiling stare. Maidens had guarded his door, but he did not think he had seen her before the Aiel gathered to leave the Stone. She looked back at him, proud as a green-eyed hawk, then tossed her head and turned her attention to the clan chief.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">Well, I wanted to be ordinary again</span>, he thought, a touch ruefully. The Aiel certainly gave him that. They offered even the clan chief only a respectful hearing, without any of the elaborate deference a lord would exact, and obedience that seemed between equals. He could hardly expect more for himself.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rhuarc gave instructions in few words, and the listening Aiel fanned out ahead into the patch of hills, running easily, some veiling themselves just in case. The rest waited, standing or squatting beside the loaded pack mules.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">They represented almost every clan—except the Jenn Aiel, of course; Rand could not get it straight whether the Jenn really existed or not, since the way the Aiel mentioned them, which they seldom did, it could be either way—including some clans that had blood feuds, and others that often fought each other. He had learned that much about them. Not for the first time, he wondered what had held them together so far. Was it just their prophecies of the Stone falling, and the search for He Who Comes With the Dawn?</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“More than that,” Rhuarc said, and Rand realized he had spoken his thoughts aloud. “Prophecy brought us over the Dragonwall, and the name that is not spoken drew us to the Stone of Tear.” The name he meant was “People of the Dragon,” a secret name for the Aiel; only clan chiefs and Wise Ones knew or used it, apparently seldom and only with each other. “For the rest? No one may shed the blood of another of the same society, of course, yet mixing Shaarad with Goshien, Taardad and Nakai with Shaido . . . . Even I might have danced the spears with the Shaido, if the Wise Ones had not made everyone who crossed the Dragonwall swear water oath to treat any Aiel as of the same society on this side of the mountains. Even sneaking Shaido . . . .” He shrugged slightly. “You see? It is not easy, even for me.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“These Shaido are enemies of yours?” Rand fumbled the name; in the Stone, the Aiel had gone by societies, not clans.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We have avoided blood feud,” Rhuarc said, “but Taardad and Shaido have never been friendly; the septs sometimes raid each other, steal goats or cattle. But the oaths have held with us all against three blood feuds and a dozen old hatreds between clans or septs. It helps now that we journey toward Rhuidean, even if some will leave us before. None may shed the blood of one traveling to or from Rhuidean.” The Aielman looked up at Rand, face completely expressionless. “It may be that soon no one of us will shed another’s blood.” It was impossible to say whether he found the prospect pleasing.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">An ululating cry came from one of the Maidens, standing atop a hill and waving her arms over her head.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“They have found your stone column, it seems,” Rhuarc said.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Gathering her reins, Moiraine gave Rand a level look as he rode past her, eagerly heeling Jeade’en to a gallop. Egwene reined her mare near to Mat, leaning from her saddle with a hand on the high pommel of his to engage him in close conversation. She seemed to be trying to make him tell her something, or admit something, and from the vehemence of Mat’s gestures, he was either innocent as a babe or lying in his teeth.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Flinging himself out of the saddle, Rand hurriedly climbed up the gentle slope to examine what the Maiden—it was Aviendha—had found half-buried in the ground and obscured by long grass. A weathered gray stone column, at least three spans long and a pace thick. Strange symbols covered every exposed inch, each surrounded by a narrow line of markings he thought were writing. Even if he could have read the language—if it was one—the script—if that was what it was—had long since worn to illegibility. The symbols he could make out a little better. Some of them; many might as well have been the marks of rain and wind.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Pulling grass by the handful so he could see better, he glanced at Aviendha. She had dropped her <span class="calibre18">shoufa</span> around her shoulders, baring short reddish hair, and was watching him with a flat, hard expression. “You don’t like me,” he said. “Why?” There was one symbol he had to find, the only one he knew.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Like you?” she said. “You may be He Who Comes With the Dawn, a man of destiny. Who can like or dislike such? Besides, you walk free, a wetlander despite your face, yet going to Rhuidean for honor, while I . . . .”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“While you what?” he asked when she stopped. He searched his way slowly upslope. Where was it? Two parallel wavy lines crossed at an angle by an odd squiggle. <span class="calibre18">Light, if it’s buried, it’ll take us hours to turn this over.</span> Abruptly he laughed. Not hours. He could channel and lift the thing out
of the ground, or Moiraine could, or Egwene. A Portal Stone might resist being moved, but surely they could move it that much. Channeling would not help him find the wavy lines, though. Only feeling his way along the stone would do that.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Instead of answering, the Aiel woman squatted easily with her short spears across her knees. “You have treated Elayne badly. I would not care, but Elayne is near sister to Egwene, who is my friend. Yet Egwene likes you still, so for her sake I will try.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Still searching the thick column, he shook his head. Elayne again. Sometimes he thought women all belonged to a guild, the way craftsmen in cities did. Put a foot wrong with one, and the next ten you met knew of it, and disapproved.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">His fingers stopped, returned to the bit he had just examined. It was weathered almost beyond making out, but he was sure it was the wavy lines. They represented a Portal Stone on Toman Head, not in the Waste, but they located what had been the base of the thing when it stood upright. Symbols at the top represented worlds; those at the bottom, Portal Stones. With a symbol from the top and one from the bottom, he could supposedly travel to a given Portal Stone in a given world. With just one from the bottom, he knew he could reach a Portal Stone in this world. The Portal Stone near Rhuidean, for instance. If he knew the symbol for it. Now was when he needed luck, needed that <span class="calibre18">ta’veren</span> tugging at chance to favor him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">A hand reached over his shoulder, and Rhuarc said in a reluctant voice, “These two are used for Rhuidean in old writings. Long ago, even the name was not written.” He traced two triangles, each surrounding what appeared to be forked lightnings, one pointing left, one right.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Do you know what this is?” Rand asked. The Aielman looked away. “Burn me, Rhuarc, I have to know. I know you don’t want to talk of it, but you have to tell me. Tell me, Rhuarc. Have you ever seen its like before?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The other man took a deep breath before answering. “I have seen its like.” Each word came as if dragged. “When a man goes to Rhuidean, Wise Ones and clansmen wait on the slopes of Chaendaer near a stone like this.” Aviendha stood up and walked away stiffly; Rhuarc glanced after her, frowning. “I know no more of it, Rand al’Thor. May I never know shade if I do.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand traced the unreadable script surrounding the triangles. Which one? Only one would take him where he wanted to go. The second might land him on the other side of the world, or the bottom of the ocean.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The rest of the Aiel had gathered at the foot of the hill with their pack mules. Moiraine and the others dismounted and climbed the easy slope, leading their horses. Mat had Jeade’en as well as his own brown gelding, keeping the stallion well away from Lan’s Mandarb. The two stallions eyed one another fiercely now that they had no riders.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You truly don’t know what you are doing, do you?” Egwene protested. “Moiraine, stop him. We can ride to Rhuidean. Why are you letting him go on with this? Why don’t you say something?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What would you suggest I do?” the Aes Sedai said dryly. “I can hardly drag him away by his ear. We may be about to see how useful Dreaming really is.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Dreaming?” Egwene said sharply. “What does Dreaming have to do with this?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Will you two be quiet?” Rand made himself sound patient. “I am trying to decide.” Egwene stared at him indignantly; Moiraine showed no emotion at all, but she watched intently.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Do we have to do it this way?” Mat said. “What do you have against riding?” Rand only looked at him, and he shrugged uncomfortably. “Oh, burn me. If you’re trying to decide . . . .” Taking both horses’ reins in one hand, he dug a coin from his pocket, a gold Tar Valon mark, and sighed. “It would be the same coin, wouldn’t it.” He rolled the coin across the backs of his fingers. “I’m . . . lucky sometimes, Rand. Let my luck choose. Head, the one that points to your right; flame, the other. What do you say?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“This is the most ridiculous,” Egwene began, but Moiraine silenced her with a touch on the arm.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand nodded. “Why not?” Egwene muttered something; all he caught were “men” and “boys,” but it did not sound a compliment.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The coin spun into the air off Mat’s thumb, gleaming dully in the sun. At its peak, Mat snatched it back and slapped it down on the back of his other hand, then hesitated. “It’s a bloody thing to be trusting to the toss of a coin, Rand.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand laid his palm on one of the symbols without looking. “This one,” he said. “You chose this one.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Mat peeked at the coin and blinked. “You’re right. How did you know?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It has to work for me sooner or later.” None of them understood—he could see that—but it did not matter. Lifting his hand, he looked at what
he and Mat had picked. The triangle pointed left. The sun had slid down from its apex. He had to do this right. A mistake, and they could lose time, not gain it. That had to be the worst outcome. It had to be.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Standing, he dug into his pouch and pulled out the small hard object, a carving of shiny dark green stone that fit easily into his hand, a round-faced round-bodied man sitting cross-legged with a sword across his knees. He rubbed a thumb over the figure’s bald head. “Gather everyone close. Everyone. Rhuarc, have them bring those pack animals up here. Everyone has to be as close to me as possible.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Why?” the Aielman asked.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We’re going to Rhuidean.” Rand bounced the carving on his palm and bent to pat the Portal Stone. “To Rhuidean. Right now.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rhuarc gave him a long flat look, then straightened, already calling to the other Aiel.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine took a step closer up the grassy slope. “What is that?” she asked curiously.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“An <span class="calibre18">angreal</span>,” Rand said, turning it in his hand. “One that works for men. I found it in the Great Holding when I was hunting that doorway. It was the sword that made me pick it up, and then I knew. If you are wondering how I mean to channel enough of the Power to take us all—Aiel, pack mules, everybody and everything—this is it.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Rand,” Egwene said anxiously, “I am sure you think you are doing what is best, but are you certain? Are you certain that <span class="calibre18">angreal</span> is strong enough? I can’t even be sure it <span class="calibre18">is</span> one. I believe you if you say it is, but <span class="calibre18">angreal</span> vary, Rand. At least, those that women can use do. Some are more potent than others, and size or shape is no guide.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Of course I’m certain,” he lied. There had been no way to test it, not for this purpose, not without letting half of Tear know he was up to something, but he thought it would do. Just. And as small as it was, no one would know it was gone from the Stone unless they decided to inventory the Holding. Not likely, that.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You leave <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> behind and bring this,” Moiraine murmured. “You seem to have considerable knowledge of using Portal Stones. More than I would have thought.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Verin told me a good bit,” he said. Verin had, but it had been Lanfear who first explained them to him. He had known her as Selene, then, but he did not intend explaining that to Moiraine any more than he would tell her of the woman’s offer of help. The Aes Sedai had taken the news of Lanfear’s
appearance too calmly, even for her. And she had that weighing look in her eyes, as if she had him on balance scales in her mind.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Take a care, Rand al’Thor,” she said in that icy, musical voice. “Any <span class="calibre18">ta’veren</span> shapes the Pattern to one degree or another, but a <span class="calibre18">ta’veren</span> such as you might rip the Age Lace for all of time.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He wished he knew what she was thinking. He wished he knew what <span class="calibre18">she</span> was planning.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Aiel climbed the hill with their pack mules, covering the slope as they crowded close around him and the Portal Stone, crowding in shoulder to shoulder on everyone but Moiraine and Egwene. Those two they left a little space. Rhuarc nodded at him as if saying, It is done, it is in your hands now.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Hefting the shiny green <span class="calibre18">angreal</span>, he thought of telling the Aiel to leave the animals, but there was the question of whether they would, and he wanted to arrive with all of them, with all feeling he had done well by them. Goodwill might be in short supply in the Waste. They watched him with imperturbable faces. Some had veiled themselves, though. Mat, nervously rolling that Tar Valon mark across the backs of his fingers over and over, and Egwene, sweat beading on her face, were the only ones who seemed anxious. There was no point in waiting any longer. He had to move faster than anyone thought he could.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He wrapped himself in the Void and reached out for the True Source, that sickly flickering light that was always there, just over his shoulder. The Power filled him, breath of life, wind to uproot oaks, summer wind sweetened with flowers, foul waftings from a midden heap. Floating in emptiness, he fixed the lightning-laced triangle before him and reached through the <span class="calibre18">angreal</span>, drew deeply at the raging torrent of <span class="calibre18">saidin.</span> He had to carry them all. It had to work. Holding that symbol, he pulled at the One Power, pulled it into him until he was sure he would burst. Pulled more. More.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The world seemed to wink out of existence.</span></div>
