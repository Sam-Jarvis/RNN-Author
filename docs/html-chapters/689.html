<p class="chapterOpenerText">Morgase Trakand, once Queen of Andor, served tea. She moved from person to person in the large pavilion Perrin had taken from Malden. It had sides that could be rolled up and no tent floor.</p>
<p class="para">Large though the tent was, there was barely enough room for all who had wanted to attend the meeting. Perrin and Faile were there, of course, sitting on the ground. Next to them sat golden-eyed Elyas and Tam al’Thor, the simple farmer with the broad shoulders and the calm manners. Was this man really the father of the Dragon Reborn? Of course, Morgase had seen Rand al’Thor once, and the boy hadn’t looked much more than a farmer himself.</p>
<p class="para">Beside Tam sat Perrin’s dusty secretary, Sebban Balwer. How much did Perrin know of his past? Jur Grady was there also, wearing his black coat with a silver sword pin on the collar. His leathery farmer’s face was hollow-eyed and still pale from the sickness he’d suffered recently. Neald—the other Asha’man—was not there. He hadn’t yet recovered from his snakebites.</p>
<p class="para">All three Aes Sedai were there. Seonid and Masuri sat with the Wise Ones, and Annoura sat beside Berelain, occasionally shooting glances at the six Wise Ones. Gallenne sat on Berelain’s other side. Across from them sat Alliandre and Arganda.</p>
<p class="para">The officers made Morgase think of Gareth Bryne. She hadn’t seen him in a long while, not since she’d exiled him for reasons she still couldn’t quite explain. Very little about that time in her life made sense to her now. Had she really been so infatuated with a man that she’d banished Aemlyn and Ellorien?</p>
<p class="para">Anyway, those days were gone. Now Morgase picked her way carefully through the room and saw that people’s cups were kept full.</p>
<p class="para">“Your work took longer than I’d expected,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para">“You gave us a duty to attend to, Perrin Aybara,” Nevarin replied. “We accomplished it. It took us as much time as needed to do it correctly. Surely you don’t imply that we did otherwise.” The sandy-haired Wise One sat directly in front of Seonid and Masuri.</p>
<p class="para">“Give over, Nevarin,” Perrin grunted as he unrolled a map before him on the ground; it had been drawn by Balwer using instructions from the Ghealdanin. “I wasn’t questioning you. I was asking if there were any problems in the burning.”</p>
<p class="para">“The village is gone,” Nevarin said. “And every plant we found with a <span class="italic1">hint</span> of Blight has been burned to ash. As well we did. You wetlanders would have much trouble dealing with something as deadly as the Blight.”</p>
<p class="para">“I think,” Faile said, “that you would be surprised.”</p>
<p class="para">Morgase glanced at Faile, who locked eyes with the Wise One. Faile sat like a queen, once again dressed to her station in a fine dress of green and violet, pleated down the sides and divided for riding. Oddly, Faile’s sense of leadership seemed to have been <span class="italic1">enhanced</span> by her time spent with the Shaido.</p>
<p class="para">Morgase and Faile had quickly gone back to being mistress and servant. In fact, Morgase’s life here was strikingly similar to what it had been in the Shaido camp. True, some things were different; Morgase wasn’t likely to be strapped here, for instance. That didn’t change the fact that—for a time—she and the other four women had been equals. No longer.</p>
<p class="para">Morgase stopped beside Lord Gallenne and refilled his cup, using the same skills she’d cultivated in attending Sevanna. At times, being a servant seemed to require more stealth than being a scout. She wasn’t to be seen, wasn’t to distract. Had her own servants acted this way around her?</p>
<p class="para">“Well,” Arganda said, “if anyone is wondering where we’ve gone, the smoke from that fire is an easy indicator.”</p>
<p class="para">“We’re far too many people to think of hiding,” Seonid said. Recently, she and Masuri had begun being allowed to speak without reprimand from the Wise Ones, though the Green did still glance at the Aiel women before speaking. It galled Morgase to see that. Sisters of the Tower, made apprentices to a bunch of wilders? It was said to have been done at Rand al’Thor’s order, but how would any man—even the Dragon Reborn—be capable of such a thing?</p>
<p class="para">It discomforted her that the two Aes Sedai no longer seemed to resist their station. A person’s situation in life could change her dramatically. Gaebril, then Valda, had taught Morgase that lesson. The Aiel captivity had been merely another step in the process.</p>
<p class="para">Each of these experiences had moved her farther away from the Queen she had been. Now she didn’t long for fine things or her throne. She just wanted some stability. That, it seemed, was a commodity more precious than gold.</p>
<p class="para">“It doesn’t matter,” Perrin said, tapping the map. “So, we’re decided? We chase after Gill and the others on foot for now, sending scouts by gateway to find them, if possible. Hopefully, we’ll catch them before they reach Lugard. How long to the city would you say, Arganda?”</p>
<p class="para">“Depends on the mud,” the wiry soldier said. “There’s a reason we call this time of year the swamping. Wise men don’t travel during the spring melt.”</p>
<p class="para">“Wisdom is for those who have time for it,” Perrin muttered, counting off distance on the map with his fingers.</p>
<p class="para">Morgase moved to refill Annoura’s cup. Pouring tea was more complicated than she’d ever assumed. She had to know whose cup to take aside and fill, and whose to fill while they were holding it. She had to know precisely how high to fill a cup so that it would not spill, and how to pour the tea without rattling the porcelain or splashing. She knew when to not be seen and when to make a slight production out of filling cups in case she’d missed people, forgotten them or misjudged their needs.</p>
<p class="para">She carefully took Perrin’s cup from beside him on the ground. He liked to gesture when he spoke, and could knock the cup from her hand if she was unwary. All in all, there was a remarkable art to serving tea—an entire world that Morgase the Queen had never bothered to notice.</p>
<p class="para">She refilled Perrin’s cup and placed it back beside him. Perrin asked other questions about the map—nearby towns, potential sources of resupply. He had a lot of promise as a leader, even if he was rather inexperienced. A little advice from Morgase—</p>
<p class="para">She cut that thought off. Perrin Aybara was a rebel. The Two Rivers was part of Andor, and he’d named himself lord of it, flying that wolfhead banner. At least the flag of Manetheren had been taken down. Flying that had been nothing short of an open declaration of war.</p>
<p class="para">Morgase no longer bristled every time someone named him a lord, but she also didn’t intend to offer him any help. Not until she determined how to move him back beneath the cloak of the Andoran monarchy.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Besides,</span> Morgase grudgingly admitted, <span class="italic1">Faile is sharp enough to give any advice I would have.</span></p>
<p class="para">Faile was actually a perfect complement to Perrin. Where he was a blunt and leveled lance at charge, she was a subtle cavalry bow. The combination of the two—with Faile’s connections to the Saldaean throne—was what really worried Morgase. Yes, he’d taken down the Manetheren banner, but he’d ordered that wolfhead banner taken down before. Often, forbidding something was the best way to ensure that it happened.</p>
<p class="para">Alliandre’s cup was half empty. Morgase moved over to refill it; like many highborn ladies, Alliandre always expected her cup to be full. Alliandre glanced at Morgase, and there was a faint glimmer of discomfort in those eyes. Alliandre felt uncertain what their relationship should be. That was curious, as Alliandre had been so haughty during their captivity. The person Morgase had once been, the Queen, wanted to sit Alliandre down and give a lengthy explanation of how to better maintain her grandeur.</p>
<p class="para">She’d have to learn on her own. Morgase was no longer the person she had once been. She wasn’t sure what she was, but she <span class="italic1">would</span> learn how to do her duty as a lady’s maid. This was becoming a passion for her. A way to prove to herself that she was still strong, still of value.</p>
<p class="para">In a way, it was terrifying that she worried about that.</p>
<p class="para">“Lord Perrin,” Alliandre said as Morgase moved away. “Is it true that you’re planning on sending my people back to Jehannah after you find Gill and his group?”</p>
<p class="para">Morgase continued past Masuri—the Aes Sedai liked her cup refilled only when she tapped on it lightly with her fingernail.</p>
<p class="para">“I do,” Perrin replied. “We all know it wasn’t completely your will to join us in the first place. If we hadn’t brought you along, you’d never have been captured by the Shaido. Masema is dead. Time to let you return to governing your nation.”</p>
<p class="para">“With all due respect, my Lord,” Alliandre said. “Why are you recruiting from among my countrymen if not to gather an army for future use?”</p>
<p class="para">“I’m not trying to recruit,” Perrin said. “Just because I don’t turn them away doesn’t mean I intend to enlarge this army any further.”</p>
<p class="para">“My Lord,” Alliandre said. “But surely it is wise to keep what you have.”</p>
<p class="para">“She has a point, Perrin,” Berelain added softly. “One need only look at the sky to know the Last Battle is imminent. Why send her force back? I’m certain that the Lord Dragon will have need of every soldier from every land sworn to him.”</p>
<p class="para">“He can send for them when he decides to,” Perrin said stubbornly.</p>
<p class="para">“My Lord,” Alliandre said. “I did not swear to him. I swore to <span class="italic1">you</span>. If Ghealdan will march for Tarmon Gai’don, it should do so beneath your banner.”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin stood up, startling several people. Was he leaving? “Just a moment. I need to call for someone,” he said as he walked to the open side of the tent and stepped out.</p>
<p class="para">A weave of the One Power kept sound from passing in or out. Morgase could see Masuri’s weaves, tied off and warding the tent. Their intricacy seemed to mock her own minuscule talent.</p>
<p class="para">Masuri tapped the side of her cup, and Morgase hastened to refill it. The woman liked to sip tea when nervous.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin came back into the tent, followed by handsome young Wil al'Seen carrying a cloth-wrapped bundle.</p>
<p class="para">“Unfurl it,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para">The young man did so, looking apprehensive. It bore the wolfhead emblem that was Perrin’s sigil.</p>
<p class="para">“I didn’t make this banner,” Perrin said. “I never wanted it, but—upon advice—I let it fly. Well, the reasons for doing that are past. I’d order the thing taken down, but that never seems to work for long.” He looked to Wil. “Wil, I want it passed through camp. I’m giving a direct order. I want each and every copy of this blasted banner <span class="italic1">burned</span>. You understand?”</p>
<p class="para">Wil paled. “But—”</p>
<p class="para">“Do it,” Perrin said. “Alliandre, you’ll swear to Rand as soon as we find him. You won’t ride beneath my banner, because I won’t <span class="italic1">have</span> a banner. I’m a blacksmith, and that’s the end of it. I’ve stomached this foolishness for too long.”</p>
<p class="para">“Perrin?” Faile asked. She looked surprised. “Is this wise?”</p>
<p class="para">Fool man. He should have at least talked to his wife about this. But men would be men. They liked their secrets and their plans.</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t know if it’s wise. But it’s what I’m doing,” he said, sitting down. “Be off, Wil. I want those banners burned by tonight. No holdouts, you understand?”</p>
<p class="para">Wil stiffened, then spun and strode from the tent without giving a reply. The lad looked as if he felt betrayed. Oddly, Morgase found herself feeling a little of the same. It was foolish. This was what she wanted—it was what Perrin should do. And yet, the people were frightened, with good reason. That sky, the things that were happening in the world…Well, in a time like this, perhaps a man could be excused for taking command.</p>
<p class="para">“You are a fool, Perrin Aybara,” Masuri said. She had a blunt way about her.</p>
<p class="para">“Son,” Tam addressed Perrin, “the lads put a lot of stock in that banner.”</p>
<p class="para">“Too much,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para">“Perhaps. But it’s good to have something to look to. When you took down the other banner, it was hard on them. This will be worse.”</p>
<p class="para">“It needs to be done,” Perrin said. “The Two Rivers men have gotten too attached to it, started talking like they’re going to stay with me instead of going back to their families where they belong. When we get gateways working again, Tam, you’ll be taking them and going.” He looked at Berelain. “I suppose I can’t be rid of you and your men. You’ll go back with me to Rand.”</p>
<p class="para">“I wasn’t aware,” Berelain said stiffly, “that you needed to ‘be rid’ of us. You seemed far less reluctant to accept my support when demanding the services of my Winged Guardsmen in rescuing your wife.”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin took a deep breath. “I appreciate your help, all of you. We did a good thing in Malden, and not just for Faile and Alliandre. It was a thing that needed doing. But burn me, that’s over now. If you want to go on to follow Rand, I’m sure he’ll have you. But my Asha’man are exhausted, and the tasks I was given are complete. I’ve got these hooks inside of me, pulling me back to Rand. Before I can do that, I need to be done with all of you.”</p>
<p class="para">“Husband,” Faile said, her words clipped. “Might I suggest that we begin with the ones who <span class="italic1">want</span> to be sent away?”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes,” Aravine said. The former <span class="italic1">gai’shain</span> sat near the back of the tent, easy to overlook, though she had become an important force in Perrin’s camp administration. She acted as something of an unofficial steward for him. “Some of the refugees would be happy to return to their homes.”</p>
<p class="para">“I’d rather move everyone, if I can,” Perrin said. “Grady?”</p>
<p class="para">The Asha’man shrugged his shoulders. “The gateways I’ve made for scouts haven’t taxed me too much, and I think I could make some larger ones. I’m still a little weak, but I am mostly over the sickness. Neald will need more time, though.”</p>
<p class="para">“My Lord.” Balwer coughed softly. “I have some figures of curious note. Moving as many people as you now have through gateways will take hours, maybe days. It won’t be a quick endeavor, as when we approached Malden.”</p>
<p class="para">“That’s going to be rough, my Lord,” Grady said. “I don’t think I could hold one open such a long time. Not if you want me strong enough to be in fighting shape, just in case.”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin settled back down, inspecting the map again. Berelain’s cup was empty; Morgase hurried over to fill it. “All right, then,” Perrin said. “We’ll start sending some smaller groups of refugees away, but those who want to leave first.”</p>
<p class="para">“Also,” Faile said. “Perhaps it is time to send messengers to contact the Lord Dragon; he might be willing to send more Asha’man.”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin nodded. “Yes.”</p>
<p class="para">“Last we knew,” Seonid said, “he was in Cairhien. The largest number of the refugees are from there, so we could begin by sending some of them home, along with scouts to meet with the Lord Dragon.”</p>
<p class="para">“He’s not there,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para">“How do you know?” Edarra set down her cup. Morgase crept around the perimeter of the tent and snatched it for refilling. Eldest of the Wise Ones, and perhaps foremost among them—it was hard to tell with Wise Ones—Edarra looked strikingly young for her reported age. Morgase’s own tiny ability in the One Power was enough to tell her that this woman was strong. Probably the strongest in the room.</p>
<p class="para">“I…” Perrin seemed to flounder. Had he a source of information he wasn’t sharing? “Rand has a habit of being where you don’t expect him. I doubt he’s remained in Cairhien. But Seonid is right—it’s the best place to start looking.”</p>
<p class="para">“My Lord,” Balwer said. “I worry about what we might, ahem, blunder into if we are not careful. Fleets of refugees, returning through gateways unexpectedly? We have been out of touch for some time. Perhaps, in addition to contacting the Dragon, we could send scouts to gather information?”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin nodded. “I could approve that.”</p>
<p class="para">Balwer settled back, looking pleased, though that man was strikingly good at hiding his emotions. Why did he want so badly to send someone to Cairhien?</p>
<p class="para">“I’ll admit,” Grady said, “I’m worried about moving all of these people. Even once Neald is well, it’s going to be exhausting to hold gateways open long enough to get them all through.”</p>
<p class="para">“Perrin Aybara,” Edarra said. “There may be a way to fix this problem.”</p>
<p class="para">“How?”</p>
<p class="para">“These apprentices have been speaking of something. A circle, it is called? If we linked together, the Asha’man and some of us, then perhaps we could give them the strength to create larger gateways.”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin scratched at his beard. “Grady?”</p>
<p class="para">“I’ve never linked in a circle before, my Lord. But if we could figure it out…well, bigger gateways would move more people through faster. That could help a lot.”</p>
<p class="para">“All right,” Perrin said, turning back to the Wise One. “What would it cost me for you to try this?”</p>
<p class="para">“You have worked too long with Aes Sedai, Perrin Aybara,” Edarra said with a sniff. “Not everything must be done at a <span class="italic1">cost</span>. This will benefit us all. I have been contemplating suggesting it for some time.”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin frowned. “How long have you known that this might work?”</p>
<p class="para">“Long enough.”</p>
<p class="para">“Burn you, woman, why didn’t you bring it to me <span class="italic1">earlier</span>, then?”</p>
<p class="para">“You seem hardly interested in your position as chief, most of the time,” Edarra said coldly. “Respect is a thing earned and not demanded, Perrin Aybara.”</p>
<p class="para">Morgase held her breath at that insolent comment. Many a lord would snap at someone for that tone. Perrin froze, but then nodded, as if that were the expected answer.</p>
<p class="para">“Your Asha’man were sick when I first thought of this,” Edarra continued. “It would not have worked before. This is the appropriate time to raise the question. Therefore, I have done so.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">She insults Aes Sedai with one breath,</span> Morgase thought, <span class="italic1">then acts just like one with the next.</span> Still, being a captive in Malden had helped Morgase begin to understand Aiel ways. Everyone claimed the Aiel were incomprehensible, but she gave talk like that little credence. Aiel were people, like any other. They had odd traditions and cultural quirks, but so did everyone else. A queen had to be able to understand all of the people within her realm—and all of her realm’s potential enemies.</p>
<p class="para">“Very well,” Perrin said. “Grady, don’t fatigue yourself too much, but start working with them. See if you can manage forming a circle.”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, my Lord,” Grady said. The Asha’man always seemed somewhat distant. “Might be good to involve Neald in this. He gets dizzy when he stands, but he’s been itching to do something with the Power. This might be a way for him to get back into practice.”</p>
<p class="para">“All right,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para">“We have not finished talking of the scouts we are sending to Cairhien,” Seonid said. “I would like to be with the group.”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin scratched his bearded chin. “I suppose. Take your Warders, two Maidens and Pel Aydaer. Be unobtrusive, if you can.”</p>
<p class="para">“Also Camaille Nolaisen will go,” Faile said. Of course she would add one <span class="italic1">Cha Faile</span> to the group.</p>
<p class="para">Balwer cleared his throat. “My Lord. We are in dire need of paper and new pen nibs, not to mention some other delicate materials.”</p>
<p class="para">“Surely that can wait.” Perrin frowned.</p>
<p class="para">“No,” Faile said slowly. “No, husband, I think this is a good suggestion. We should send one person to collect supplies. Balwer, would you go and fetch the things yourself?”</p>
<p class="para">“If my Lady wishes it,” the secretary said. “I have ached to visit this school the Dragon has opened in Cairhien. They would have the supplies we need.”</p>
<p class="para">“I suppose you can go, then,” Perrin said. “But nobody else. Light! Any more, and we might as well send the whole burning army through.”</p>
<p class="para">Balwer nodded, looking satisfied. That one was obviously spying for Perrin now. Would he tell Aybara who she really was? Had he done so already? Perrin didn’t act as if he knew.</p>
<p class="para">She gathered up more cups; the meeting was beginning to break up. Of course Balwer would offer to spy for Aybara; she should have approached the dusty man earlier, to see what the price would be to keep his silence. Mistakes like that could cost a queen her throne.</p>
<p class="para">She froze, hand halfway to a cup. <span class="italic1">You’re not a queen any longer. You have to stop thinking like one!</span></p>
<p class="para">During the first weeks following her silent abdication, she’d hoped to find a way to return to Andor, so she could be a resource for Elayne. However, the more she’d considered it, the more she’d realized that she had to stay away. Everyone in Andor <span class="italic1">had</span> to assume that Morgase was dead. Each queen had to make her own way, and Elayne might seem a puppet to her own mother if Morgase returned. Beyond that, Morgase had made many enemies before leaving. Why had she <span class="italic1">done</span> such things? Her memory of those times was cloudy, but her return would only rip open old wounds.</p>
<p class="para">She continued gathering up cups. Perhaps she should have done the noble thing and killed herself. If enemies of the throne discovered who she was, they could use her against Elayne, the same way that the Whitecloaks would have. But for now, she was not a threat. Besides, she was confident that Elayne would not risk Andor’s safety, even to save her mother.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin bade farewell to the attendees and gave some basic instructions for the evening camp. Morgase knelt down, using a rag to wipe dirt from the side of a teacup that had rolled over. Niall had told her that Gaebril was dead, and al’Thor held Caemlyn. That would have prompted Elayne to return, wouldn’t it? Was she queen? Had the Houses supported her, or had they acted against her because of what Morgase had done?</p>
<p class="para">The scouting party might bring news that Morgase hungered for. She would have to find a way into any meeting discussing their reports, perhaps by offering to serve the tea. The better she grew at her job as Faile’s maid, the closer she’d be able to get to important events.</p>
<p class="para">As the Wise Ones made their way from the tent, Morgase caught sight of someone outside. Tallanvor, dutiful as always. Tall, broad of shoulder, he wore his sword at his waist and a look of pointed concern in his eyes.</p>
<p class="para">He’d followed her practically nonstop since Malden, and while she’d complained of it out of principle, she didn’t mind. After two months apart, he wanted to take every opportunity to be together. Looking into those beautiful young eyes of his, she could not entertain the notion of suicide, even for the good of Andor. She felt a fool for that. Hadn’t she let her heart lead her into enough trouble already?</p>
<p class="para">Malden had changed her, though. She’d missed Tallanvor dearly. And then he’d come for her, when he shouldn’t have risked himself so. He was more devoted to her than to Andor itself. And for some reason, that was exactly what she needed. She began to make her way toward him, balancing eight cups in the crook of her arm while carrying the saucers in her hand.</p>
<p class="para">“Maighdin,” Perrin said as she passed out of the tent. She hesitated, turning back. Everyone but Perrin and his wife had withdrawn.</p>
<p class="para">“Come back here, please,” Perrin said. “And Tallanvor, you might as well come in. I can see you lurking out there. Honestly. It’s not as if anyone was going to swoop down and steal her away while she was inside a tent full of Wise Ones and Aes Sedai!”</p>
<p class="para">Morgase raised an eyebrow. From what she’d seen, Perrin himself had followed Faile around lately nearly as much.</p>
<p class="para">Tallanvor shot her a smile as he entered. He took some of the cups from her arm, then both of them presented themselves before Perrin. Tallanvor bowed formally, which gave Morgase a stab of annoyance. He was still a member of the Queen’s Guard—the only loyal member, as far as she knew. He shouldn’t be bowing to this rural upstart.</p>
<p class="para">“I was given a suggestion back when you first joined us,” Perrin said gruffly. “Well, I think it’s about time I took it. Lately, you two are like youths from different villages, mooning over one another in the hour before Sunday ends. It’s high time you were married. We could have Alliandre do it, or maybe I could. Do you have some tradition you follow?”</p>
<p class="para">Morgase blinked in surprise. Curse Lini for putting that idea in Perrin’s head! Morgase felt a sudden panic, though Tallanvor glanced at her questioningly.</p>
<p class="para">“Go change into something nicer if you want,” Perrin said. “Gather any you want to witness and be back here in an hour. Then we’ll get this silliness over with.”</p>
<p class="para">She felt her face grow hot with anger. Silliness? How dare he! And in such a way! Sending her off like a child, as if her emotion—her love—was merely an inconvenience to him?</p>
<p class="para">He was rolling up his map, but then Faile’s hand placed on his arm caused him to look up and notice that his orders had not been followed.</p>
<p class="para">“Well?” Perrin asked.</p>
<p class="para">“No,” Morgase said. She kept her gaze on Perrin; she didn’t want to see the inevitable disappointment and rejection in Tallanvor’s face.</p>
<p class="para">“What?” Perrin asked.</p>
<p class="para">“No, Perrin Aybara,” Morgase said. “I will <span class="italic1">not</span> be back here in an hour to be married.”</p>
<p class="para">“But—”</p>
<p class="para">“If you want tea served, or your tent cleaned, or something packed, then call for me. If you wish your clothing washed, I will oblige. But I am your servant, Perrin Aybara, <span class="italic1">not</span> your subject. I am loyal to the Queen of Andor. You have no authority to give me this sort of command.”</p>
<p class="para">“I—”</p>
<p class="para">“Why, the Queen herself wouldn’t demand this! Forcing two people to marry because you’re tired of the way they look at one another? Like two hounds you intend to breed, then sell the pups?”</p>
<p class="para">“I didn’t mean it that way.”</p>
<p class="para">“You said it nonetheless. Besides, how can you be sure of the young man’s intentions? Have you spoken to him, asked him, interviewed him as a lord should in a matter like this?”</p>
<p class="para">“But Maighdin,” Perrin said. “He <span class="italic1">does</span> care for you. You should have seen the way he acted when you were taken. Light, woman, but it’s obvious!”</p>
<p class="para">“Matters of the heart are never obvious.” Pulling herself up to her full height, she almost felt a queen again. “If I choose to marry a man, I will make that decision on my own. For a man who claims he doesn’t like being in charge, you certainly do like giving commands. How can you be sure that I <span class="italic1">want</span> this young man’s affections? Do you know my heart?”</p>
<p class="para">To the side, Tallanvor stiffened. Then he bowed formally to Perrin and strode from the tent. He was an emotional one. Well, he needed to know that she would not be shoved around. Not anymore. First Gaebril, then Valda, and now Perrin Aybara? Tallanvor would be ill-served if he were to receive a woman who married him because she was told to do so.</p>
<p class="para">Morgase measured Perrin, who was blushing. She softened her tone. “You’re young at this yet, so I’ll give you advice. There are some things a lord should be involved in, but others he should <span class="italic1">always</span> leave untouched. You’ll learn the difference as you practice, but kindly refrain from making demands like this one until you’ve at least counseled with your wife.”</p>
<p class="para">With that, she curtsied—still carrying the teacups—and withdrew. She shouldn’t have spoken to him so. Well, he shouldn’t have made a command like that! It seemed she had some spark left in her after all. She hadn’t felt that firm or certain of herself since…well, since before Gaebril’s arrival in Caemlyn! Though she would have to find Tallanvor and soothe his pride.</p>
<p class="para">She returned the cups to the nearby washing station, then went through the camp, looking for Tallanvor. Around her, servants and workers were busy at their duties. Many of the former <span class="italic1">gai’shain</span> still acted as if they were among the Shaido, bowing and scraping whenever someone so much as looked at them. Those from Cairhien were the worst; they’d been held longest, and Aiel were <span class="italic1">very</span> good at teaching lessons.</p>
<p class="para">There were, of course, a few real Aiel <span class="italic1">gai’shain</span>. What an odd custom. From what Morgase had been able to determine, some of the <span class="italic1">gai’shain</span> here had been taken by the Shaido, then had been liberated in Malden. They retained the white, and so that meant they were now acting as slaves to their own relatives and friends.</p>
<p class="para">Any people could be understood. But, she admitted, perhaps the Aiel would take longer than others. Take, for instance, that group of Maidens loping through camp. Why did they have to force everyone out of their way? There was no—</p>
<p class="para">Morgase hesitated. Those Maidens were heading straight for Perrin’s tent. They looked like they had news.</p>
<p class="para">Her curiosity getting the better of her, Morgase followed. The Maidens left two guards by the front tent flaps, but the ward against eavesdropping had been removed. Morgase rounded the tent, trying to look as if she was doing anything <span class="italic1">other</span> than eavesdropping, feeling a stab of shame for leaving Tallanvor to his pain.</p>
<p class="para">“Whitecloaks, Perrin Aybara,” Sulin’s stout voice reported from inside. “There is a large force of them on the road directly in front of us.”</p>
