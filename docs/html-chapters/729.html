<h2 class="chapterTitle3"><span class="bold1"><span class="italic">Working Leather</span></span></h2></div>
<div class="calibre8">
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Androl carefully took the oval piece of leather from the steaming water; it had darkened and curled. He moved quickly, picking it up in his callused fingers. The leather was springy and flexible now.</p>
<p class="para">He quickly sat down at his bench, a square of sunlight coming in through the window on his right side. He wrapped the leather around a thick wooden rod about two inches across, then poked holes around the edges.</p>
<p class="para">From there, he began stitching the leather to another piece he’d prepared earlier. A good stitching around the outside would keep it from fraying. A lot of leatherworkers were casual about stitching. Not Androl. The stitching was what people saw first; it stood out, like paint on a wall.</p>
<p class="para">As he worked, the leather dried and lost some of its springiness, but it was still flexible enough. He made the stitches neat and even. He pulled the last few tight and used them to tie the leather around the wooden rod; he’d cut those last once the leather dried.</p>
<p class="para">Stitching done, he added some ornaments. A name across the top, pounded into place using his small mallet and letter-topped pins. The symbols of the Sword and Dragon came next; he’d made those plates himself, based on the pins the Asha’man wore.</p>
<p class="para">At the bottom, using his smaller letter pins, he stamped the words, “Defend. Guard. Protect.” As the leather continued to dry, he got out his stain and gauze to carefully color the letters and the designs for contrast.</p>
<p class="para">There was a tranquility to this kind of work; so much of his life was about destruction these days. He knew that had to be. He’d come to the Black Tower in the first place because he understood what was to come. Still, it was nice to create something.</p>
<p class="para">He left his current piece, letting it dry while working on some saddle straps. He measured the straps with the marks on the side of his table, then reached for his shears in the tool pouch that hung from the side of his table—he’d made that himself. He was annoyed to discover that they weren’t in their place.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Burn the day word got out that I had good shears in here,</span> he thought. Despite Taim’s supposedly strict rules for the Black Tower, there was a distressing amount of chaos. Large infractions were punished with harsh measures, but the little things—like wandering into a man’s workshop and “borrowing” his shears—were ignored. Particularly if the borrower was one of the M’Hael’s favorites.</p>
<p class="para">Androl sighed. His belt knife was waiting at Cuellar’s place for sharpening. <span class="italic1">Well,</span> he thought, <span class="italic1">Taim</span> does <span class="italic1">keep telling us to look for excuses to channel…</span> Androl emptied himself of emotion, then seized the Source. It had been months since he’d had trouble doing that—at first, he’d been able to channel only when he was holding a strap of leather. The M’Hael had beaten that out of him. It had not been a pleasant process.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Saidin</span> flooded into him, sweet, powerful, beautiful. He sat for a long moment, enjoying it. The taint was gone. What a wonder that was. He closed his eyes and breathed in deeply.</p>
<p class="para">What would it be like to draw in as much of the One Power as the others could? At times, he thirsted for that. He knew he was weak—weakest of the Dedicated in the Black Tower. Perhaps so weak he should never have been promoted from soldier. Logain had gone to the Lord Dragon about it, and made the promotion happen, against Taim’s express wishes.</p>
<p class="para">Androl opened his eyes, then held up the strap and wove a tiny gateway, only an inch across. It burst alive in front of him, slicing the strap in two. He smiled, then let it vanish and repeated the process.</p>
<p class="para">Some said that Logain had forced Androl’s promotion only as a dig against Taim’s authority. But Logain had said that it was Androl’s incredible Talent with gateways that had earned him the title of Dedicated. Logain was a hard man, broken around the edges, like an old scabbard that hadn’t been properly lacquered. But that scabbard still held a deadly sword. Logain was honest. A good man, beneath the scuff marks.</p>
<p class="para">Androl eventually finished with the straps. He walked over and snipped the string holding the oval piece of leather in place. It retained its shape, and he held it up to the sunlight, inspecting the stitching. The leather was stiff without being brittle. He fit it onto his forearm. Yes, the molding was good.</p>
<p class="para">He nodded to himself. One of the tricks to life was paying attention to the small details. Focus, make the small things right. If each stitch was secure on an armguard, then it wouldn’t fray or snap. That could mean the difference between an archer lasting through a barrage or having to put away his bow.</p>
<p class="para">One archer wouldn’t make a battle. But the small things piled up, one atop another, until they became large things. He finished the armguard by affixing a few permanent ties to its back, so one could bind it in place on the arm.</p>
<p class="para">He took his black coat off the back of his chair. The silver sword pin on the high collar glimmered in the window’s sunlight as he did up the buttons. He glanced at himself in the glass’s reflection, making certain the coat was straight. Small things were important. Seconds were small things, and if you heaped enough of those on top of one another, they became a man’s life.</p>
<p class="para">He put the armguard on his arm, then pushed open the door to his small workshop and entered the outskirts of the Black Tower’s village. Here, clusters of two-storied buildings were arranged much like any small town in Andor. Peaked roofs, thatched, with straight wooden walls, some stone and brick as well. A double line of them ran down the center of the village. Looking only at those, one might have thought he was strolling through New Braem or Grafendale.</p>
<p class="para">Of course, that required ignoring the men in black coats. They were everywhere, running errands for the M’Hael, going to practice, working on the foundations of the Black Tower structure itself. This place was still a work in progress. A group of soldiers—bearing neither the sword pin nor the red-and-gold Dragon—used the Power to blast a long trough in the ground beside the road. It had been decided that the village needed a canal.</p>
<p class="para">Androl could see the weaves—mostly Earth—spinning around the soldiers. In the Black Tower, you did as much with the Power as you could. Always training, like men lifting stones to build their strength. Light, how Logain and Taim pushed those lads.</p>
<p class="para">Androl moved out onto the newly graveled roadway. Much of that gravel bore melted edges from where it had been blasted. They had brought in boulders—through gateways, on weaves of Air—then shattered them with explosive weaves. It had been like a war zone, rocks shattering, spraying chips. With Power—and training—like that, the Asha’man would be able to reduce city walls to rubble.</p>
<p class="para">Androl continued on his way. The Black Tower was a place of strange sights, and melted gravel wasn’t nearly the strangest of them. Neither were the soldiers tearing up ground, following Androl’s own careful surveying. Lately, the strangest sight to him was the children. They ran and played, jumping into the trough left behind by the working soldiers, sliding down its earthen sides, then scrambling back up.</p>
<p class="para">Children. Playing in the holes created by <span class="italic1">saidin</span> blasts. The world was changing. Androl’s own gramma—so ancient she’d lost every tooth in her mouth—had used stories of men channeling to frighten him into bed on nights when he tried to slip outside and count the stars. The darkness outside hadn’t frightened him, nor had stories of Trollocs and Fades. But men who could channel…that had terrified him.</p>
<p class="para">Now he found himself here, grown into his middle years, suddenly afraid of the dark but completely at peace with men who could channel. He walked down the road, gravel crunching beneath his boots. The children came scrambling up out of the ditch and flocked around him. He idly brought out a handful of candies, purchased on the last scouting mission.</p>
<p class="para">“Two each,” he said sternly as dirty hands reached for the candies. “And no shoving, mind you.” Hands went to mouths, and the children gave him bobbed heads in thanks, calling him “Master Genhald,” before racing away. They didn’t go back to the trench, but invented a new game, running off toward the fields to the east.</p>
<p class="para">Androl brushed off his hands, smiling. Children were so adaptable. Before them, centuries of tradition, terror and superstition could melt away like butter left too long in the sun. But it was good that they’d chosen to leave the trench. The One Power could be unpredictable.</p>
<p class="para">No. That wasn’t right. <span class="italic1">Saidin</span> was very predictable. The men who wielded it, however…well, they were a different story.</p>
<p class="para">The soldiers halted their work and turned to meet him. He wasn’t a full Asha’man, and didn’t merit a salute, but they showed him respect. Too much. He wasn’t sure why they deferred to him. He was no great man, particularly not here, in the Black Tower.</p>
<p class="para">Still, they nodded to him as he passed. Most of these were among the men who had been recruited from the Two Rivers. Sturdy lads and men, eager, though many were on the young side. Half of them didn’t need to shave but once a week. Androl walked up to them, then inspected their work, eyeing the line of string he’d tied to small stakes. He nodded in approval. “Angle is good, lads,” he said. “But keep the sides steeper, if you can.”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, Master Genhald,” said the one leading the team. Jaim Torfinn was his name, a spindly young man with dusty brown hair. He still held the Power. That raging river of strength was so enticing. Rare was the man who could release it without a sense of loss.</p>
<p class="para">The M’Hael encouraged them to keep hold of it, said that holding it taught them to control it. But Androl had known seductive sensations somewhat like <span class="italic1">saidin</span> before—the exhilaration of battle, the intoxication of rare drinks from the Isles of the Sea Folk, the heady feeling of victory. A man could be swept up in those feelings and lose control of himself, forgetting who he was. And <span class="italic1">saidin</span> was more seductive than anything else he’d experienced.</p>
<p class="para">He said nothing to Taim about his reservations. He had no business lecturing the M’Hael.</p>
<p class="para">“Here,” Androl said, “let me show you what I mean by straight.” He took a deep breath, then emptied himself of feeling. He used the old soldier’s trick to do that—he’d been taught it by his first instructor in the sword, old one-armed Garfin, whose heavy rural Illianer accent had been virtually incomprehensible. Of course, Androl himself had a faint Taraboner accent, he was told. It had faded over the years since he’d last been home.</p>
<p class="para">Within the nothing—the void—Androl could feel the raging force that was <span class="italic1">saidin</span>. He grabbed it as a man grabbed the neck of a horse running wild, hoping to steer in some small way but mostly just trying to hold on.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Saidin</span> was wonderful. Yes, it was more powerful than any intoxicant. It made the world more beautiful, more <span class="italic1">lush</span>. Holding that terrible Power, Androl felt as if he’d come to life, leaving the dry husk of his former self behind. It threatened to carry him away in its swift currents.</p>
<p class="para">He worked quickly, weaving a tiny trickle of Earth—the best he could manage, for Earth was where he was weakest—and carefully shaved the sides of the canal. “If you leave too much jutting out,” he explained as he worked, “then the canal flow will stay muddy as it washes away the earth on the sides. The straighter and more firm the sides, the better. You see?”</p>
<p class="para">The soldiers nodded. Sweat had beaded on their brows, flakes of dirt sticking to their foreheads and cheeks. But their black coats were clean, particularly the sleeves. You could judge a man’s respect for his uniform by whether or not he used the sleeve to wipe his brow on a day like this. The Two Rivers lads used handkerchiefs.</p>
<p class="para">The more senior Asha’man, of course, rarely sweated at all. It would take these lads more practice to get that down while concentrating so much.</p>
<p class="para">“Good men,” Androl said, standing up and glancing over them. Androl laid a hand on Jaim’s shoulder. “You lads are doing a fine job here. The Two Rivers, it grows men right.”</p>
<p class="para">The lads beamed. It was good to have them, particularly compared to the quality of men Taim had been recruiting lately. The M’Hael’s scouts claimed they took whoever they could find, yet why was it that most they brought back had such angry, unsettling dispositions?</p>
<p class="para">“Master Genhald?” asked one of the soldiers.</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, Trost?” Androl asked.</p>
<p class="para">“Have you…Have you heard anything of Master Logain?”</p>
<p class="para">The others looked hopeful.</p>
<p class="para">Androl shook his head. “He hasn’t returned from his scouting mission. I’m sure he’ll be back soon.”</p>
<p class="para">The lads nodded, though he could see that they were beginning to worry. They had a right to. Androl had been worrying for weeks now. Ever since Logain had left in the night. Where had he gone? Why had he taken Donalo, Mezar and Welyn—three of the most powerful Dedicated loyal to him—along?</p>
<p class="para">And now there were those Aes Sedai camped outside, supposedly sent with authority from the Dragon to bond Asha’man. Taim had given one of his half-smiles at that, the kind that never reached his eyes, and told them the group from the White Tower had first pick, since they’d come first. The others waited, impatiently.</p>
<p class="para">“The M’Hael,” one of the Two Rivers men said, expression growing dark. “He—”</p>
<p class="para">“Keep your heads on your shoulders,” Androl interrupted, “and don’t make waves. Not yet. We wait for Logain.”</p>
<p class="para">The men sighed, but nodded. Distracted by the conversation, Androl almost didn’t notice when the shadows nearby began creeping toward him. Shadows of men, lengthening in the sunlight. Shadows within the trough. Shadows of rocks and clefts in the earth. Slowly, deviously, they turned toward Androl. Androl steeled himself, but couldn’t dispel the panic. This one terror he could feel despite the void.</p>
<p class="para">They came whenever he held <span class="italic1">saidin</span> for too long. He released it immediately, and the shadows reluctantly crept back to their places.</p>
<p class="para">The Two Rivers lads watched him, discomfort in their faces. Could they see the wild cast to Androl’s eyes? Nobody spoke of the…irregularities that afflicted men of the Black Tower. It just wasn’t done. Like whispering dirty family secrets.</p>
<p class="para">The taint was cleansed. These lads would never have to feel the things that Androl did. Eventually, he and the others who had been in the Tower before the cleansing would become rarities. Light, but he couldn’t understand why anyone would listen to him. Weak in the Power and insane to boot?</p>
<p class="para">And the worst part was, he <span class="italic1">knew</span>—deeply, down to his very center—that those shadows were real. Not just some madness concocted by his mind. They were real, and they would destroy him if they reached him. They <span class="italic1">were</span> real. They had to be.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Oh, Light,</span> he thought, gritting his teeth. <span class="italic1">Either option is terrifying. Either I’m insane or the darkness itself wants to destroy me.</span></p>
<p class="para">That was why he could no longer sleep at nights without huddling in fear. Sometimes he could go hours holding the Source without seeing the shadows. Sometimes only minutes. He took a deep breath.</p>
<p class="para">“All right,” he said, satisfied that his voice—at least—sounded in control. “You best get back to work. Keep that slope moving the right direction, mind you. We’ll have a mess and a half to deal with if the water overflows and floods this area.”</p>
<p class="para">As they obeyed, Androl left them, cutting back through the village. Near the center stood the barracks, five large, thick-stoned buildings for the soldiers, a dozen smaller buildings for the Dedicated. Right now, this little village <span class="italic1">was</span> the Black Tower. That would change. A tower proper was being built nearby, the foundation already dug.</p>
<p class="para">He could visualize what the place might someday look like. He’d once worked with a master architect—one of a dozen different apprenticeships he’d held in a life that sometimes seemed to have lasted too long. Yes, he could see it in his mind’s eye. A domineering black stone tower, Power-built. Strong, sturdy. At its base would be blockish square structures with crenelated tops.</p>
<p class="para">This village would grow to become a town, then a large city, as vast as Tar Valon. The streets had been built to allow the passing of several wagons at a time. New sections were surveyed and laid. It bespoke vision and planning. The streets themselves whispered of the Black Tower’s destiny.</p>
<p class="para">Androl followed a worn pathway through the scrub grass. Distant <span class="italic1">boom</span>s and <span class="italic1">snap</span>s echoed across the plains like the sounds of a whip being cracked. Each man had his own reasons for coming. Revenge, curiosity, desperation, lust for power. Which was Androl’s reason? All four, perhaps?</p>
<p class="para">He left the village, and eventually rounded a line of trees and came to the practice range—a small canyon between two hills. A line of men stood channeling Fire and Earth. The hills needed to be leveled to make land for farming. An opportunity to practice.</p>
<p class="para">These men were mostly Dedicated. Weaves spun in the air, much more skillful and powerful than those the Two Rivers lads had used. These were streamlined, like hissing vipers or striking arrows. Rocks exploded, and bursts of dirt sprayed into the air. The blasting was done in an unpredictable pattern to confuse and disorient foes. Androl could imagine a group of cavalry thundering down that slope, only to be surprised by exploding Earth. A single Dedicated could wipe out dozens of riders in moments.</p>
<p class="para">Androl noted with dissatisfaction that the working men stood in two groups. The Tower was beginning to split and divide, those loyal to Logain shunned and ostracized. On the right, Canler, Emarin and Nalaam worked with focus and dedication, joined by Jonneth Dowtry—the most skilled soldier among the Two Rivers lads. On the left, a group of Taim’s cronies were laughing among themselves. Their weaves were more wild, but also much more destructive. Coteren lounged at the back, leaning against a leafy hardgum tree and overseeing the work.</p>
<p class="para">The workers took a break and called for a village boy to bring water. Androl walked up, and Arlen Nalaam saw him first, waving with a broad smile. The Domani man wore a thin mustache. He was just shy of his thirtieth year, though he sometimes acted much younger. Androl was still smarting from the time Nalaam had put tree sap in his boots.</p>
<p class="para">“Androl!” Nalaam called. “Come tell these uncultured louts what a Retashen Dazer is!”</p>
<p class="para">“A Retashen Dazer?” Androl said. “It’s a drink. Mix of mead and ewe’s milk. Foul stuff.”</p>
<p class="para">Nalaam looked at the others proudly. He had no pins on his coat. He was only a soldier, but he should have been advanced by now.</p>
<p class="para">“You bragging about your travels again, Nalaam?” Androl asked, unlacing the leather armguard.</p>
<p class="para">“We Domani get around,” Nalaam said. “You know, the kind of work my father does, spying for the Crown….”</p>
<p class="para">“Last week you said your father was a merchant,” Canler said. The sturdy man was the oldest of the group, his hair graying, his square face worn from many years in the sun.</p>
<p class="para">“He is,” Nalaam said. “That’s his front for being a spy!”</p>
<p class="para">“Aren’t women the merchants in Arad Doman?” Jonneth asked, rubbing his chin. He was a large, quiet man with a round face. His entire family—his siblings, his parents, and his grandfather Buel—had relocated to the village rather than letting him come alone.</p>
<p class="para">“Well, they’re the best,” Nalaam said, “and my mother is no exception. We men know a thing or two, though. Besides, since my mother was busy infiltrating the Tuatha’an, my father had to take over the business.”</p>
<p class="para">“Oh, now that’s just ridiculous,” Canler said with a scowl. “Who would ever want to infiltrate a bunch of Tinkers?”</p>
<p class="para">“To learn their secret recipes,” Nalaam said. “It’s said that a Tinker can cook a pot of stew so fine that it will make you leave house and home to travel with them. It’s true, I’ve tasted it myself, and I had to be tied in a shed for three days before the effect wore off.”</p>
<p class="para">Canler sniffed. However, after a moment, the farmer added, “So…did she find the recipe or not?”</p>
<p class="para">Nalaam launched into another story, Canler and Jonneth listening intently. Emarin stood to the side, looking on with amusement—he was the other soldier in the group, bearing no pins. He was an older man, with thin hair and wrinkles at his eyes. His short white beard was trimmed to a point.</p>
<p class="para">The distinguished man was something of an enigma; he’d arrived with Logain one day, and had said nothing of his past. He had a poised bearing and a delicate way of speaking. He was a nobleman, that was certain. But unlike most other noblemen in the Black Tower, Emarin made no attempt at asserting his presumed authority. Many noblemen took weeks to learn that once you joined the Black Tower, your outside rank was meaningless. That made them sullen and snappish, but Emarin had taken to life in the Tower immediately.</p>
<p class="para">It took a nobleman with true dignity to follow the orders of a commoner half his age without complaint. Emarin took a sip of water from the serving boy, thanking the lad, then stepped up to Androl. He nodded toward Nalaam, who was still talking to the others. “That one has the heart of a gleeman.”</p>
<p class="para">Androl grunted. “Maybe he can use it to earn some extra coin. He still owes me a new pair of socks.”</p>
<p class="para">“And you, my friend, have the soul of a scribe!” Emarin laughed. “You never forget a thing, do you?”</p>
<p class="para">Androl shrugged.</p>
<p class="para">“How did you know what a Retashen Dazer was? I consider myself quite educated in these matters, yet I’d heard not a word of it.”</p>
<p class="para">“I had one once,” Androl said. “Drank it on a bet.”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, but where?”</p>
<p class="para">“Retash, of course.”</p>
<p class="para">“But that’s leagues off shore, in a cluster of islands not even the Sea Folk often visit!”</p>
<p class="para">Androl shrugged again. He glanced over at Taim’s lackeys. A village boy had brought them a basket of food from Taim, though the M’Hael claimed not to play favorites. If Androl asked, he’d find that a boy was supposed to have been sent with food for the others, too. But that lad would have become lost, or had forgotten, or made some other innocent mistake. Taim would have someone whipped, and nothing would change.</p>
<p class="para">“This division is troubling, my friend,” Emarin said softly. “How can we fight for the Lord Dragon if we cannot make peace among ourselves?”</p>
<p class="para">Androl shook his head.</p>
<p class="para">Emarin continued. “They say that no man favored of Logain has had the Dragon pin in weeks. There are many, like Nalaam there, who should have had the sword pin long ago—but are denied repeatedly by the M’Hael. A House whose members squabble for authority will never present a threat to other Houses.”</p>
<p class="para">“Wise words,” Androl said. “But what should we do? What <span class="italic1">can</span> we do? Taim is M’Hael, and Logain hasn’t returned yet.”</p>
<p class="para">“Perhaps we could send someone for him,” Emarin said. “Or maybe you could calm the others. I fear that some of them are near to snapping, and if a fight breaks out, I have little doubt who would see the rough side of Taim’s punishments.”</p>
<p class="para">Androl frowned. “True. But why me? You’re far better with words than I am, Emarin.”</p>
<p class="para">Emarin chuckled. “Yes, but Logain trusts you, Androl. The other men look to you.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">They shouldn’t,</span> Androl thought. “I’ll see what I can think of.” Nalaam was winding up for another story, but before he could begin, Androl gestured to Jonneth, holding up the armguard. “I saw your old one had cracked. Try this.”</p>
<p class="para">Jonneth’s face brightened as he took the armguard. “You’re amazing, Androl! I didn’t think anyone had noticed. It’s a silly thing, I know, but…” His smile broadened and he hurried to a nearby tree, beside which sat some of the men’s equipment, including Jonneth’s bow. These Two Rivers men liked to have them handy.</p>
<p class="para">Jonneth returned, stringing the bow. He put on the armguard. “Fits like a dream!” he said, and Androl felt himself smiling. Small things. They could mean so much.</p>
<p class="para">Jonneth took aim and launched an arrow, the shaft streaking into the air, bowstring snapping against the armguard. The arrow soared far, striking a tree on a hill better than two hundred paces away.</p>
<p class="para">Canler whistled. “Ain’t ever seen anything like those bows of yours, Jonneth. Never in my life.” They were fellow Andorans, though Canler had come from a town much closer to Caemlyn.</p>
<p class="para">Jonneth looked at his shot critically, then drew again—fletching to cheek—and loosed. The shaft fell true and hit the very same tree. Androl would guess that the shafts were less than two handspans apart.</p>
<p class="para">Canler whistled again.</p>
<p class="para">“My father trained on one of those,” Nalaam noted. “Learned the art from a Two Rivers man whom he rescued from drowning in Illian. Has the bowstring as a memento.”</p>
<p class="para">Canler raised an eyebrow, but he seemed taken with the tale at the same time. Androl just chuckled, shaking his head. “Mind if I have a go, Jonneth? I’m a pretty dead shot with a Tairen bow, and they’re a little longer than most.”</p>
<p class="para">“Surely,” the lanky man said, unstrapping the armguard and handing over the bow.</p>
<p class="para">Androl donned the armguard and lifted the bow. It was of black yew, and there wasn’t as much spring to the string as he was used to. Jonneth handed him an arrow and Androl mimicked the man’s pull, drawing to his cheek.</p>
<p class="para">“Light!” he said at the weight of the pull. “Those arms of yours are deceptively small, Jonneth. How do you manage to aim? I can barely keep it steady!”</p>
<p class="para">Jonneth laughed as Androl’s arms trembled, and he finally loosed, unable to keep the bow drawn for a breath longer. The arrow hit the ground far off target. He handed the bow to Jonneth.</p>
<p class="para">“That was fairly good, Androl,” Jonneth said. “A lot of men can’t even get the string back. Give me ten years, and I could have you shooting like one born in the Two Rivers!”</p>
<p class="para">“I’ll stick to shortbows for now,” Androl said. “You’d never be able to shoot a monster like that from horseback.”</p>
<p class="para">“I wouldn’t need to!” Jonneth said.</p>
<p class="para">“What if you were being chased?”</p>
<p class="para">“If there were fewer than five of them,” Jonneth said, “I’d take them all down with this before they got to me. If there were more than five, then what am I doing shooting at them? I should be running like the Dark One himself was after me.”</p>
<p class="para">The other men chuckled, though Androl caught Emarin eyeing him. Probably wondering how Androl knew to shoot a bow from horseback. He was a keen one, that nobleman. Androl would have to watch himself.</p>
<p class="para">“And what is this?” a voice asked. “You do be trying to learn to shoot a bow, pageboy? Is this so you can actually defend yourself?”</p>
<p class="para">Androl gritted his teeth, turning as Coteren sauntered up. He was a bulky man, his black, oily hair kept long and loose. It hung around a blunt face with pudgy cheeks. His eyes were focused, dangerous. He smiled. The smile of a cat that had found a rodent to play with.</p>
<p class="para">Androl quietly undid the armguard, handing it to Jonneth. Coteren was full Asha’man, a personal friend of the M’Hael. He outranked everyone here by a long stride.</p>
<p class="para">“The M’Hael will hear of this,” Coteren said. “You do be ignoring your lessons. You have no need for arrows or bows—not when you can kill with the Power!”</p>
<p class="para">“We aren’t ignoring anything,” Nalaam said stubbornly.</p>
<p class="para">“Quiet, lad,” Androl said. “Mind your tongue.”</p>
<p class="para">Coteren laughed. “Listen to the pageboy, you lot. The M’Hael will hear of your impudence also.” He focused on Androl. “Seize the Source.”</p>
<p class="para">Androl obliged reluctantly. The sweetness of <span class="italic1">saidin</span> flowed into him, and he glanced nervously to the side. There was no sign of the shadows.</p>
<p class="para">“So pathetic,” Coteren said. “Destroy that stone over there.”</p>
<p class="para">It was far too large for him. But he’d dealt with bullies before, and Coteren was a bully of the most dangerous type—one with power and authority. The best thing to do was to mind. Embarrassment was a small punishment. That was something few bullies seemed to understand.</p>
<p class="para">Androl wove the requisite weave of Fire and Earth, striking at the large stone. The thin weave held almost all of the Power he could manage, but it only flaked a few chips off the large stone.</p>
<p class="para">Coteren laughed heartily, as did the group of Dedicated eating beneath the nearby tree. “Bloody ashes, but you’re useless!” Coteren said. “Forget what I said earlier, pageboy! You <span class="italic1">need</span> that bow!”</p>
<p class="para">Androl released the One Power. Coteren had had his laugh; he would be satisfied. Unfortunately, Androl felt men seize the Source behind him. Jonneth, Canler and Nalaam stepped up beside Androl, each of them filled with the One Power and bristling with anger.</p>
<p class="para">The men who had been eating stood up, each holding the Source as well. There were twice as many of them as there were of Androl’s friends. Coteren smirked.</p>
<p class="para">Androl eyed Canler and the others. “Now lads,” he said, raising a hand, “Asha’man Coteren was just doing what the M’Hael ordered him. He’s trying to make me mad so I’ll push myself.”</p>
<p class="para">The two groups hesitated. The intensity of their locked gazes rivaled that of the Power within them. Then Jonneth released the Source. This caused Nalaam to do likewise, and finally gruff Canler turned away. Coteren laughed.</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t like this,” Canler muttered as the group of them walked off. He shot a glance over his shoulder. “Don’t like it at all. Why’d you stop us, Androl?”</p>
<p class="para">“Because they’d have made rubble of us faster than you can curse, Canler,” Androl snapped. “Light, man! I can barely channel worth a bean, and Emarin hasn’t been here a month yet. Jonneth’s learning fast, but we all know he’s never actually fought with the Power before, and half of Coteren’s men saw battle beneath the Lord Dragon! You really think you and Nalaam could handle ten men, virtually on your own?”</p>
<p class="para">Canler continued to bristle, muttering, but let the argument drop.</p>
<p class="para">“Makashak Na famalashten morkase,” Nalaam mumbled, “delf takaksaki mere!” He laughed to himself, eyes wild. It wasn’t a language Androl knew—it wasn’t the Old Tongue, that was for certain. It probably wasn’t even a language at all.</p>
<p class="para">None of the others said anything. Nalaam occasionally cackled to himself in gibberish. If asked about it, he’d claim he’d spoken in plain ordinary words. The outburst seemed to discomfit Emarin and Jonneth a great deal. They hadn’t ever seen friends go mad and kill those around them. Light send that they’d never <span class="italic1">have</span> to see it, now. Whatever else Androl thought of the Lord Dragon for leaving them alone, the cleansing earned al’Thor redemption. Channeling was safe now.</p>
<p class="para">Or, at least, it was <span class="italic1">safer</span>. Channeling would never be safe, particularly now with Taim pushing them.</p>
<p class="para">“More and more people are taking those burning personal lessons from Taim,” Nalaam muttered as they walked to the shade of the trees. “Nensen’s success has the men eager. We’ve lost a good dozen to Taim’s side in the last few weeks. Soon there won’t be anyone left besides us here. I’m afraid to talk to half the men I used to trust.”</p>
<p class="para">“Norley is trustworthy,” Canler said. “Evin Hardlin, too.”</p>
<p class="para">“That’s a small list,” Nalaam said. “Too small.”</p>
<p class="para">“The Two Rivers men are with us,” Jonneth said. “To a man.”</p>
<p class="para">“Still a small list,” Nalaam said. “And not a full Asha’man among us.”</p>
<p class="para">They all looked to Androl. He glanced back at Taim’s lackeys, laughing among themselves again.</p>
<p class="para">“What, Androl?” Nalaam asked. “Not going to chastise us for talking like that?”</p>
<p class="para">“Like what?” Androl asked, looking back at them.</p>
<p class="para">“Like it’s us against them.”</p>
<p class="para">“I didn’t want you lads to get yourselves killed or imprisoned, but that doesn’t mean I don’t see a problem.” He glanced back at them. “Aye, there’s trouble here, brewing like a storm.”</p>
<p class="para">“The men who take Taim’s private lessons learn too quickly,” Nalaam said. “Nensen was barely powerful enough to be considered for Dedicated just a short time ago. Now he’s full Asha’man. Something very strange is going on. And those Aes Sedai. Why did Taim agree to let them bond us? You know he’s protected all of his favorites by stopping the Aes Sedai from choosing any man with the Dragon pin. Burn me, but I don’t know what I’ll do if one chooses me. I’m not going to be put on some Aes Sedai’s string.”</p>
<p class="para">There were several mutters about that.</p>
<p class="para">“Taim’s men spread rumors among the newcomers,” Jonneth said softly. “They talk about the Lord Dragon, and how he drove good men to turn traitor. They say he’s abandoned us, and that he’s gone mad. The M’Hael doesn’t want those rumors pointing back to him, but burn me if he isn’t the source of them all.”</p>
<p class="para">“Maybe he’s right,” Canler said. The others looked at him sharply, and the leathery man scowled. “I’m not saying that I’m going to go jump into Taim’s camp. But the Lord Dragon? What has <span class="italic1">he</span> done for us? Seems like he’s forgotten about this place. Maybe he <span class="italic1">is</span> mad.”</p>
<p class="para">“He’s not,” Emarin said, shaking his head. “I met him just before I came here.”</p>
<p class="para">The others looked at him, surprised.</p>
<p class="para">“He impressed me,” Emarin said. “Young, but with a powerful will. I trust him. Light! I barely spoke with him a half-dozen times, but I trust him.”</p>
<p class="para">The others slowly nodded.</p>
<p class="para">“Burn me,” Canler said, “I suppose that’s good enough for me. But I wish he’d listen! I heard Logain cursing that the Lord Dragon won’t hear him when he gives warnings about Taim.”</p>
<p class="para">“And if we gave him evidence?” Jonneth asked. “What if we could find something that <span class="italic1">proves</span> that Taim is up to no good?”</p>
<p class="para">“Something <span class="italic1">is</span> strange about Nensen,” Nalaam repeated. “And that Kash. Where did he even come from, and how did he grow so powerful so quickly? What if, when Logain returned, we had information for him. Or if we could take it to the Lord Dragon directly…”</p>
<p class="para">The group turned to Androl. Why did they look to him, the weakest of them? All he could do was create gateways. That was where Coteren’s nickname for Androl had come from. Pageboy. The only thing he was good for was delivering messages, taking people places.</p>
<p class="para">But the others looked to him. For one reason or another, they looked to him.</p>
<p class="para">“All right,” Androl said. “Let’s see what we can find. Bring Evin, Hardlin and Norley into this but don’t tell anyone else, not even the other Two Rivers lads. Don’t rile Taim or his men…but if you <span class="italic1">do</span> find something, bring it to me. And I’ll see if I can find a way to contact Logain, or at least find where he went.”</p>
<p class="para">Each man nodded, somber. <span class="italic1">Light help us if we’re wrong,</span> Androl thought, looking back at Taim’s favorites. <span class="italic1">And Light help us more if we’re right.</span></p>
