<div class="subtitle-chapter"><span class="calibre2"><span class="calibre18">The Stone Stands</span></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">D</span>ead Aielmen lay at Rand’s feet, tangled with the bodies of three very ordinary men in very ordinary coats and breeches. Ordinary-looking men, except that six Aiel, the entire guard, had been slain, some obviously before they knew what was happening, and each of those ordinary men had at least two Aiel spears through him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">That was not the half of it, though. As soon as he pulled the door open, a roar of battle had washed over him: shouting, howling, steel clashing on steel among the redstone columns. The Defenders in the anteroom were fighting for their lives beneath the gilded lamps, against bulky, blackmailed shapes head-and-shoulders taller than they, shapes like huge men, but with heads and faces distorted by horns or feathers, by muzzle or beak where mouth and nose should be. Trollocs. They strode on paws or hooves as often as on booted feet, cutting men down with oddly spiked axes and hooked spears and scythelike swords that curved the wrong way. And with them, a Myrddraal, like a sleek-moving man with maggot-white skin in black armor, like death made bloodless flesh.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Somewhere in the Stone an alarm gong sounded, then stopped with lethal suddenness. Another took it up, and another, in brazen tolls.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Defenders fought, and they still outnumbered the Trollocs, but there were more men down than Trollocs. Even as Rand’s eyes found them, the Myrddraal tore off half the Tairen captain’s face with one bare
hand while the other drove a dead black blade through a Defender’s throat, slipping Defenders’ spear thrusts like a snake. The Defenders faced what they had thought were only travelers’ tales to frighten children; their nerve was frayed to snapping. One man who had lost his rimmed helmet threw down his spear and tried to flee, only to have his head split like a melon by a Trolloc’s massive axe. Yet another man looked at the Myrddraal and fled screaming. The Myrddraal darted sinuously to intercept. In a moment the humans would all be running.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Fade!” Rand shouted. “Try me, Fade!” The Myrddraal stopped as if it had never moved, its pale, eyeless face turning to him. Fear rippled through Rand at that stare, sliding over the bubble of cold calm that encased him when he held <span class="calibre18">saidin</span>; in the Borderlands they said, “The look of the Eyeless is fear.” Once he had believed Fades rode shadows like horses and disappeared when they turned sideways. Those old beliefs were not so very far wrong.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Myrddraal flowed toward him, and Rand leaped the dead men in front of the doorway to meet it, his boots skidding on bloody black marble as he landed. “Rally to the Stone!” he shouted as he leaped. “The Stone stands!” Those were the battle cries he had heard on the night the Stone had not stood.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He thought he heard a vexed shout of “Fool!” from the room he had left, but he had no time for Lanfear or what she might do. That skid very nearly cost him his life; his red-gold blade barely turned the Myrddraal’s black one as he fought for balance. “Rally to the Stone! The Stone stands!” He had to keep the Defenders together, or face the Myrddraal and twenty Trollocs alone. “The Stone stands!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The Stone stands!” he heard someone echo him, then another. “The Stone stands!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Fade moved as fluidly as a serpent, the snakelike illusion heightened by the overlapping plates of black armor down its chest. Yet not even a blacklance ever struck so quickly. For a time it was all Rand could do to keep its blade from his own unarmored flesh. That black metal could make wounds that festered, almost as hard to Heal as the one that ached in his side now. Each time dark steel forged in Thakan’dar, below the slopes of Shayol Ghul, met red-gold Power-wrought blade, light flashed like sheet lightning in the room, a sharp bluish white that hurt the eyes. “You will die this time,” the Myrddraal rasped at him in a voice like the crumbling of dead leaves. “I will give your flesh to the Trollocs and take your women for my own.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand fought as coldly as he ever had, and as desperately. The Fade knew the use of a sword. Then an instant came when he could strike a blow squarely at the sword itself, not merely divert it. With a hiss as of ice falling on molten metal the red-gold blade sheared through the black. His next blow took that eyeless head from its shoulders; the shock of hacking through bone shivered up his arms. Inky blood fountained from the stump of its neck. The thing did not fall, though. Thrashing blindly with its broken sword, the headless figure stumbled about, striking randomly at the air.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">As the Fade’s head fell to roll across the floor, the remaining Trollocs fell, too, shrieking, kicking, tearing at their heads with coarse-haired hands. It was a weakness of Myrddraal and Trollocs. Even Myrddraal did not trust Trollocs, so they often linked with them in some way Rand did not understand; it apparently ensured the Trollocs’ loyalty, but those linked to a Myrddraal did not survive its death long.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Defenders still standing, fewer than two dozen, did not wait. In twos and threes they stabbed each Trolloc repeatedly with their spears until it stopped moving. Some of them had the Myrddraal down, but it flailed wildly no matter how much they stabbed. As the Trollocs fell silent, a few surviving human wounded could be heard moaning, weeping. There were still more men littering the floor than Shadowspawn. The black marble was slick with blood, almost invisible against the dark stone.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Leave it,” Rand told the Defenders trying to finish the Myrddraal. “It’s dead already. Fades just don’t want to admit they’re dead.” Lan had told him that, what seemed a long time ago; he had had proof of it before this. “See to the injured.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Peering at the headless, thrashing shape, its torso a tatter of gaping wounds, they shivered and moved back, muttering about Lurks. That was what they called Fades in Tear, in tales meant for children. Some began to hunt among the downed humans for any still alive, pulling aside those who could not stand, helping those who could to their feet. All too many were left where they lay. Hasty bandages ripped from a man’s own bloody shirt were the only comfort that could be offered now.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">They did not look so pretty as they had, these Tairens. Their no longer gleaming breast- and backplates bore dents and scuffs; blood-soaked slashes marred once fine black-and-gold coats and breeches. Some had no helmets, and more than one leaned on his spear as if it were the only thing holding him on his feet. Perhaps it was. They breathed heavily, wild expressions on their faces, that blend of stark terror and blind numbness that afflicts men
in battle. They stared at Rand uncertainly—fleeting, fearful stares—as if he might have called these creatures out of the Blight himself.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Wipe those spearpoints,” he told them. “A Fade’s blood will etch steel like acid if it’s left on long enough.” Most moved slowly to obey, hesitantly using what was available, the coatsleeves of their own dead.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The sounds of more fighting drifted through the corridors, distant shouts, the muted clash of metal. They had obeyed him twice; it was time to see if they would do more. Turning his back on them, he started across the anteroom, toward the sounds of battle. “Follow me,” he ordered. He raised his fire-wrought blade to remind them of who he was, hoping the reminder did not bring a spear in his back. It had to be risked. “The Stone stands! For the Stone!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">For a moment his own hollow footsteps were the only sound in the columned chamber; then boots began to follow. “For the Stone!” a man shouted, and another, “For the Stone and the Lord Dragon!” Others took it up. “For the Stone and the Lord Dragon!” Quickening to a trot, Rand led his bloodied army of twenty-three deeper into the Stone.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Where was Lanfear, and what part had she played in this? He had little time for wondering. Dead men spotted the halls of the Stone in pools of their own blood, one here and farther on two or three more, Defenders, servants, Aiel. Women, too, linen-gowned noble and wool-clad servant alike struck down as they fled. Trollocs did not care whom they killed; they took pleasure in it. Myrddraal were worse; Halfmen gloried in pain and death.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">A little deeper in, the Stone of Tear boiled. Knots of Trollocs rampaged through the halls, sometimes with a Myrddraal leading, sometimes alone, battling Aiel or Defenders, cutting down the unarmed, hunting for more to kill. Rand led his small force at any Shadowspawn they found, his sword slicing coarse flesh and black mail with equal ease. Only the Aiel faced a Fade without flinching. The Aiel and Rand. He passed up Trollocs to reach Fades; sometimes the Myrddraal took a dozen or two Trollocs with it in dying, sometimes none.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Some of his Defenders fell and did not rise, but Aiel joined them, nearly doubling their number. Groups of men broke off in furious battles that drifted away in shouts and clatter like a forge gone mad. Other men fell in behind Rand, broke away, were replaced, till none of those who had started with him remained. Sometimes he fought alone, or ran down a hallway, empty save for himself and the dead, following the sounds of distant combat.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Once, with two Defenders, in a colonnade looking down into a long chamber with many doorways, he saw Moiraine and Lan, surrounded by Trollocs. The Aes Sedai stood, head high like some storied queen of battles, and bestial shapes burst into flame around her—but only to be replaced by more, dashing in through this door or that, six or eight at a time. Lan’s sword accounted for those who escaped Moiraine’s fire. The Warder had blood on both sides of his face, yet he flowed through the forms as coolly as if practicing before a mirror. Then a wolf-snouted Trolloc thrust a Tairen spear toward Moiraine’s back. Lan whirled as though he had eyes in the back of his head, taking off the Trolloc’s leg at the knee. The Trolloc fell, howling, yet still managed to thrust spearpoint at Lan just as another clubbed the Warder awkwardly with the flat of its axe, buckling his knees.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand could do nothing, for at that moment five Trollocs fell upon him and his two companions, all snouts and boars’ tusks and rams’ horns, pushing the humans out of the colonnade by the sheer weight of their rush. Five Trollocs should have been able to kill three men without much difficulty, except that one of the men was Rand, with a sword that treated their mail like cloth. One of the Defenders died, and the other vanished chasing after a wounded Trolloc, the lone survivor of the five. When Rand hurried back to the colonnade, there was a smell of burned meat from the chamber below, and great burned bodies on its floor, but no sign of Moiraine or Lan.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">That was the way of the contest for the Stone. Or the contest for Rand’s life. Battles sprang up and drifted away from where they began, or died when one side fell. Not only did men fight Trollocs and Myrddraal. Men fought men; there were Darkfriends siding with the Shadowspawn, roughly dressed fellows who looked like former soldiers and tavern brawlers. They seemed as fearful of the Trollocs as the Tairens did, but they killed as indiscriminately, where they could. Twice Rand actually saw Trollocs battling Trollocs. He could only assume the Myrddraal had lost control of them and their bloodlust had taken over. If they wanted to slay each other, he left them to it.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Then, alone once more and seeking, he trotted ’round a corner and right into three Trollocs, each twice as wide as he and nearly half again as tall. One of them, with an eagle’s hooked beak thrusting out of an otherwise human face, was hacking an arm from the corpse of a Tairen noblewoman while the other two watched eagerly, licking their snouts. Trollocs ate anything, so long as it was meat. It was an even chance whether he was more surprised or they were, but he was the first to recover.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The one with the eagle’s beak went down, mail and belly alike opened
across. The sword-form called Lizard in the Thornbush should have done for the other two, but that first fallen Trolloc, thrashing still, half-kicked his foot out from under him, and he staggered, his blade only scoring a slice along his target’s mail, right into the path of the second Trolloc as it fell, wolf’s muzzle snapping at nothing. It crushed him to the stone tiles beneath its bulk, trapping sword arm and sword alike. The one still standing raised its spiked axe, coming as close to a smile as a boar’s snout and tusks would allow. Rand struggled to move, to breathe.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">A scythe-curved sword split the boar’s snout to the neck.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Wrenching its blade free, a fourth Trolloc bared goat teeth at him in a snarl, ears twitching beside its horns. Then it darted away, sharp hooves clicking on the floor tiles.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand heaved himself out from under the dead weight of the Trolloc, half-stunned. <span class="calibre18">A Trolloc saved me. A Trolloc?</span> Trolloc blood was all over him, thick and dark. Far down the hallway, in the opposite direction from where the goat-horned Trolloc had fled, blue-white flashed as two Myrddraal moved into view. Fighting each other, in an almost boneless blur of continuous motion. One forced the other into a crossing corridor, and the flashing light faded from sight. <span class="calibre18">I’m mad. That’s what it is. I am mad, and this is all some crazed dream</span>.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You risk everything, rushing about wildly with that . . . that sword.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand turned to face Lanfear. She had put on the appearance of a girl again, no older than he, perhaps younger. She lifted her white skirts to step over the Tairen lady’s torn body; for all the emotion on her face, it might as well have been a log.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You build a hut of twigs,” she went on, “when you could have marble palaces for the snap of your fingers. You could have had their lives and such souls as Trollocs possess with little effort, and instead they nearly killed you. You must learn. Join with me.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Was this your doing?” he demanded. “That Trolloc, saving me? Those Myrddraal? Was it?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She considered him a moment before giving a slight, regretful shake of her head. “If I take credit, you will expect it again, and that could be deadly. None of the others is really certain where I stand, and I like it that way. You can expect no open aid from me.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Expect your aid?” he growled. “You want me to turn to the Shadow. You can’t make me forget what you are with soft words.” He channeled, and she slammed against a wall hanging hard enough to make her grunt. He held her there, spread-eagled over a woven hunting scene, feet off the
floor and snowy gown spread out and flattened. How had he blocked Egwene and Elayne? He had to remember.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Suddenly he flew across the hallway to crash into the wall opposite Lanfear, pressed there like an insect by <span class="calibre18">something</span> that barely allowed him to breathe.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Lanfear appeared to have no trouble breathing. “Whatever you can do, Lews Therin, I can do. And better.” Pinned against the wall as she was, she seemed unperturbed. The din of fighting surged up somewhere nearby, then faded as the battle moved away. “You half-use the smallest fraction of what you are capable of, and walk away from what would allow you to crush all who come against you. Where is <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>, Lews Therin? Still up in your bedchamber like some useless ornament? Do you think yours is the only hand that can wield it, now that you have drawn it free? If Sammael is here, he will take it, and use it against you. Even Moghedien would take it to deny you its use; she could gain much by trading it to any male Chosen.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He struggled against whatever held him; nothing moved but his head, flung from side to side. <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> in the hands of a male Forsaken. The thought drove him half-mad with fear and frustration. He channeled, tried to pry at what held him, but there might as well have been nothing to pry. And then abruptly it was gone; he lurched away from the wall, still fighting, before he realized he was free. And from nothing he had done.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He looked at Lanfear. She still hung there, as complacently as if taking the air on a streamside. She was trying to lull him, to gull him into softening toward her. He hesitated over the flows holding her. If he tied them off and left her, she might tear half the Stone down trying to get free—if a passing Trolloc did not kill her, thinking she was one of the Stone’s folk. That should not have troubled him—not the death of a Forsaken—but the thought of leaving a woman, or anyone, helpless for Trollocs repelled him. A glance at her unruffled composure rid him of that thought. No one, nothing, in the Stone would harm her as long as she could channel. If he could find Moiraine to block her . . . .</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Once more Lanfear took the decision from him. The impact of severed flows jolted him, and she dropped lightly to the floor. He stared as she stepped away from the wall, calmly brushing her skirts. “You can’t do that,” he gasped foolishly, and she smiled.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I do not have to see a flow to unravel it, if I know what it is and where. You see, you have much to learn. I like you like this. You were always too stiff-necked and sure of yourself for comfort. It was always better when
you were a bit uncertain of your footing. Are you forgetting <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>, then?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Still he hesitated. One of the Forsaken stood there. And there was absolutely nothing he could do. Turning, he ran for <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>. Her laughter seemed to follow him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">This time he did not turn aside to fight Trollocs or Myrddraal, did not slow his wild climb through the Stone unless they got in his way. Then his sword carved of fire sliced a way through for him. He saw Perrin and Faile, he with axe in hand, she guarding his back with her knives; the Trollocs seemed as reluctant to face Perrin’s yellow-eyed stare as his axe blade. Rand left them behind without a second look. If one of the Forsaken took <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>, none of them would live to see the sun rise.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Breathless, he scrambled through the columned anteroom, leaping the dead still lying there, Defenders and Trollocs alike, in his haste to reach <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>. He flung open both doors. The Sword That Is Not a Sword sat on its gilded and gem-set stand, shining with the light of the setting sun. Waiting for him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Now that he had it in sight, safe, he was almost loath to touch it. Once, he had used <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> as it was truly meant to be used. Only once. He knew what awaited him when he took it up again, used it to draw on the True Source far beyond what any human could hold unaided. Letting go the red-gold blade seemed more than he could do; when it vanished, he almost called it back.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Feet dragging, he skirted the corpse of the Gray Man and put his hands slowly on <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>’s hilt. It was cold, like crystal long in the dark, but it did not feel so smooth that it would slip in the hand.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Something made him look up. A Fade stood in the doorway, hesitating, its pale-faced, eyeless gaze on <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand pulled at <span class="calibre18">saidin</span>. Through <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>. The Sword That Is Not a Sword blazed in his hands, as if he held noonday. The Power filled him, hammering down like solid thunder. The taint rushed through him in a flood of blackness. Molten rock pulsed along his veins; the cold inside him could have frozen the sun. He had to use it, or burst like a rotted melon.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Myrddraal turned to flee, and suddenly black clothes and armor crumpled to the floor, leaving oily motes floating in the air.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand was not even aware he had channeled until it was done; he could not have said what he had done if his life had depended upon it. But nothing could threaten his life while he held <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>. The Power throbbed in him like the heartbeat of the world. With <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> in his hands, he could
do anything. The Power hammered at him, a hammer to crack mountains. A channeled thread whisked the Myrddraal’s drifting remains out into the anteroom, and its clothes and armor, too; a trickled flow incinerated both. He strode out to hunt those who had come hunting him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Some of them had come as far the anteroom. Another Fade and a huddle of cowering Trollocs stood before the columns at the far side staring at ash that sifted out of the air, the last fragments of the Myrddraal and all its garb. At the sight of Rand with <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> flaring in his hands, the Trollocs howled like beasts. The Fade stood paralyzed with shock. Rand gave them no chance to run. Maintaining his deliberate pace toward them, he channeled, and flames roared from the bare, black marble beneath the Shadowspawn, so hot that he flung up a hand against it. By the time he reached them, the flames were gone; nothing remained but dull circles on the marble.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Back down into the Stone he went, and every Trolloc, every Myrddraal he saw died wreathed in fire. He burned them fighting Aiel or Tairens, and killing servants trying to defend themselves with spears or swords snatched from the dead. He burned them as they ran, whether stalking more victims or fleeing him. He began to move faster, trotting, then running, past the wounded, often lying untended, past the dead. It was not enough; he could not move fast enough. While he killed Trollocs in handfuls, others still slew, if only to escape.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Suddenly he stopped, surrounded by the dead, in a wide hallway. He had to do something—something more. The Power slid along his bones, pure essence of fire. Something more. The Power froze his marrow. Something to kill them all; all of them at once. The taint on <span class="calibre18">saidin</span> rolled over him, a mountain of rotting filth threatening to bury his soul. Raising <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>, he drew on the Source, drew on it till it seemed he must scream screams of frozen flame. He had to kill them all.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Just beneath the ceiling, right above his head, air slowly began to revolve, spinning faster, milling in streaks of red and black and silver. It roiled and collapsed inward, boiling harder, whining as it whirled and grew smaller still.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Sweat rolled down Rand’s face as he stared up at it. He had no idea what it was, only that racing flows he could not begin to count connected him to the mass. It had mass; a weight growing greater while the <span class="calibre18">thing</span> fell inward on itself. <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> flared brighter and brighter, too brilliant to look at; he closed his eyes, and the light seemed to burn through his eyelids. The Power raced through him, a raging torrent that threatened to carry all
that was him into the spinning. He had to let go. He had to. He forced his eyes open, and it was like looking at all the thunderstorms in the world compressed to the size of a Trolloc’s head. He had to . . . had to . . . had to . . . .</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">Now</span>. The thought floated like cackling laughter on the rim of his awareness. He severed the flows rushing out of him, leaving the thing still whirling, whining like a drill on bone. <span class="calibre18">Now</span>.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">And the lightnings came, flashing out along the ceiling left and right like silver streams. A Myrddraal stepped out of a side corridor, and before it could take a second step half a dozen flaring streaks stabbed down, blasting it apart. The other streams flowed on, fanning down every branching of the corridor, replaced by more and more erupting every second.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand had not a clue to what he had made, or how it worked. He could only stand there, quivering with the Power that filled him with the need to use it. Even if it destroyed him. He could feel Trollocs and Myrddraal dying, feel the lightnings strike and kill. He could kill them everywhere, everywhere in the world. He knew it. With <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> he could do anything. And he knew trying would kill him just as surely.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The lightnings faded and died with the last Shadowspawn; the spinning mass imploded with a loud clap of inrushing air. But <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> still shone like the sun; he shook with the Power.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine was there, a dozen paces away, staring at him. Her dress was neat, every fold of blue silk in place, but wisps of her hair were disarrayed. She looked tired—and shocked. “How . . . ? What you have done, I would not have believed possible.” Lan appeared, half-trotting up the hall, sword in hand, face bloodied, coat torn. Without taking her eyes from Rand, Moiraine flung out a hand, halting the Warder short of her. Well short of Rand. As if he were too dangerous for even Lan to approach. “Are you . . . well, Rand?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand pulled his gaze away from her, and it fell on the body of a dark-haired girl, little more than a child. She lay sprawled on her back, eyes wide and fixed on the ceiling, blood blackening the bosom of her dress. Sadly, he bent to brush strands of hair from her face. <span class="calibre18">Light, she is only a child. I was too late. Why didn’t I do it sooner? A child!</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I will see that someone takes care of her, Rand,” Moiraine said gently. “You cannot help her now.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">His hand shook so hard on <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> that he could barely hold on. “With this, I can do anything.” His voice was harsh in his own ears. “Anything!”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Rand!” Moiraine said urgently.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He would not listen. The Power was in him. <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> blazed, and he <span class="calibre18">was</span> the Power. He channeled, directing flows into the child’s body, searching, trying, fumbling; she lurched to her feet, arms and legs unnaturally rigid and jerky.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Rand, you cannot do this. Not this!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">Breathe. She has to breathe</span>. The girl’s chest rose and fell. <span class="calibre18">Heart. Has to beat</span>. Blood already thick and dark oozed from the wound in her chest. <span class="calibre18">Live. Live, burn you! I didn’t mean to be too late</span>. Her eyes stared at him, filmed. Lifeless. Tears trickled unheeded down his cheeks. “She has to live! Heal her, Moiraine. I don’t know how. Heal her!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Death cannot be Healed, Rand. You are not the Creator.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Staring into those dead eyes, Rand slowly withdrew the flows. The body fell stiffly. The body. He threw back his head and howled, as wild as any Trolloc. Braided fire sizzled into walls and ceiling as he lashed out in frustration and pain.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Sagging, he released <span class="calibre18">saidin</span>, pushed it away; it was like pushing away a boulder, like pushing away life. Strength drained out of him with the Power. The taint remained, though, a stain weighing him down with darkness. He had to ground <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> on the floor tiles and lean on it to stay on his feet.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The others.” It was hard to speak; his throat hurt. “Elayne, Perrin, the rest? Was I too late for them, too?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You were not too late,” Moiraine said calmly. But she had come no closer, and Lan looked ready to dart between her and Rand. “You must not—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Are they still alive?” Rand shouted.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“They are,” she assured him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He nodded in weary relief. He tried not to look at the girl’s body. Three days waiting, so he could enjoy a few stolen kisses. If he had moved three days ago . . . . But he had learned things in those three days, things he might be able to use if he could put them together. If. Not too late for his friends, at least. Not too late for them. “How did the Trollocs get in? I don’t think they climbed the walls like Aiel, not with the sun still up. Is it still up?” He shook his head to dispel some of the fog. “No matter. The Trollocs. How?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Lan was the one who answered. “Eight large grain barges tied up at the Stone’s docks late this afternoon. Apparently no one thought to question why laden grain barges would be coming <span class="calibre18">down</span>river”—his voice was heavy
with contempt—“or why they’d dock at the Stone, or why the crews left the hatches shut until nearly sunfall. Also, a train of wagons arrived—about two hours ago, now—thirty of them, supposedly bringing some lord or other’s things from the country for his return to the Stone. When the canvas was thrown back, they were packed with Halfmen and Trollocs, too. If they came in any other way, I don’t know of it, yet.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand nodded again, and the effort buckled his knees. Suddenly Lan was there, pulling Rand’s arm over his shoulder to hold him up. Moiraine took his face in her hands. A chill rippled through him, not the blasting cold of full Healing, but a chill that pushed weariness out as it passed. Most of the weariness. A seed remained, as if he had worked a day hoeing tabac. He moved away from the support he no longer needed. Lan watched him warily, to see if he could really stand alone, or perhaps because the Warder was not certain how dangerous he was, how sane.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I left some apurpose,” Moiraine told him. “You need to sleep tonight.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Sleep. There was too much to do to sleep. But he gave another nod. He did not want her shadowing him. Yet what he said was “Lanfear was here. This was not her doing. She said so, and I believe her. You don’t seem surprised, Moiraine.” Would Lanfear’s offer surprise her? Would anything? “Lanfear was here, and I talked with her. She didn’t try to kill me, and I didn’t try to kill her. And you are not surprised.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I doubt you could kill her. Yet.” Her glance at <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> was the merest flicker of dark eyes. “Not unaided. And I doubt she will try to kill you. Yet. We know little of any of the Forsaken, and least of all Lanfear, but we do know she loved Lews Therin Telamon. To say you are safe from her is certainly too strong—there is a good deal she can do to harm you short of murder—but I do not think she will try to kill as long as she thinks she might win Lews Therin back again.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Lanfear wanted him. The Daughter of the Night, used by mothers who only half-believed in her to frighten children. She certainly frightened him. It was nearly enough to make him laugh. He had always felt guilty for looking at any woman besides Egwene, and Egwene did not want him, but the Daughter-Heir of Andor wanted to kiss him, at least, and one of the Forsaken claimed to love him. Nearly enough for laughter, but not quite. Lanfear seemed jealous of Elayne; that pale-haired milksop, she had called her. Madness. All madness.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Tomorrow.” He started away from them.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Tomorrow?” Moiraine said.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Tomorrow, I will tell you what I am going to do.” Some of it, he
would. The thought of Moiraine’s face if he told her everything made him want to laugh. If he knew everything himself, yet. Lanfear had given him almost the last piece, without knowing it. One more step, tonight. The hand holding <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> by his side trembled. With that, he could do anything. <span class="calibre18">I am not mad yet. Not mad enough for that</span>. “Tomorrow. A good night to us all, the Light willing.” Tomorrow he would begin to unleash another kind of lightning. Another lightning that might save him. Or kill him. He was not mad yet.</span></div>
