<p class="para1"><strong class="calibre14">A Note on Dates in This Glossary</strong>. The Toman Calendar (devised by Toma dur Ahmid) was adopted approximately two centuries after the death of the last male Aes Sedai, recording years After the Breaking of the World (AB). So many records were destroyed in the Trolloc Wars that at their end there was argument about the exact year under the old system. A new calendar, proposed by Tiam of Gazar, celebrated freedom from the Trolloc threat and recorded each year as a Free Year (FY). The Gazaran Calendar gained wide acceptance within twenty years after the Wars’ end. Artur Hawkwing attempted to establish a new calendar based on the founding of his empire (FF, From the Founding), but only historians now refer to it. After the death and destruction of the War of the Hundred Years, a third calendar was devised by Uren din Jubai Soaring Gull, a scholar of the Sea Folk, and promulgated by the Panarch Farede of Tarabon. The Farede Calendar, dating from the arbitrarily decided end of the War of the Hundred Years and recording years of the New Era (NE), is currently in use.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Accepted:</strong> Young women in training to be Aes Sedai who have reached a certain level of power and passed certain tests. It normally takes five to ten years to be raised from novice to Accepted. Somewhat less confined by rules than novices, they are allowed to choose their own areas of <a id="page_810" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>study, within limits. Accepted wear a Great Serpent ring on the third finger of the left hand. When an Accepted is raised Aes Sedai, which usually takes another five to ten years, she chooses her Ajah, gains the right to wear the shawl, and may wear the ring on any finger or not at all if circumstances warrant. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Aes Sedai.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">a’dam</em></strong> (AYE-dam): A Seanchan device for controlling a woman who can channel, consisting of a collar and bracelet linked by a leash, all of silvery metal. It has no effect on a woman who cannot channel. <em class="calibre4">See also damane</em>; Seanchan; <em class="calibre4">sul’dam</em>.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Aes Sedai</strong> (EYEZ seh-DEYE): Wielders of the One Power. Since the Time of Madness, all are women. Widely distrusted and feared, even hated. Blamed by many for the Breaking of the World, and thought to meddle in the affairs of nations. At the same time, few rulers are without an Aes Sedai advisor, even where such a connection must be secret. After some years of channeling the One Power, Aes Sedai take on an ageless quality, so that one old enough to be a grandmother may show no signs of age except perhaps a few gray hairs. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Ajah; Amyrlin Seat; Time of Madness.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Age of Legends:</strong> Age ended by the War of the Shadow and the Breaking of the World. A time when Aes Sedai performed wonders now only dreamed of. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Breaking of the World; War of the Shadow; Wheel of Time.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Aiel</strong> (eye-EEL): The people of the Aiel Waste. Fierce and hardy. They veil their faces before they kill. Deadly warriors with weapons or bare hands, they will not touch a sword, nor ride a horse unless pressed. Their pipers play them into battle with the music of dances. Aiel call battle “the dance,” and “the dance of spears.” They are divided into twelve clans: the Chareen, the Codarra, the Daryne, the Goshien, the Miagoma, the Nakai, the Reyn, the Shaarad, the Shaido, the Shiande, the Taardad, and the Tomanelle. Sometimes they speak of a thirteenth clan, the Clan That Is Not, the Jenn, who were the builders of Rhuidean. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Aiel warrior societies; Aiel Waste; Rhuidean.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Aiel kinship terms:</strong> Aiel relationships of blood are expressed in complex ways which outsiders consider unwieldy, but which Aiel consider precise. A few examples must suffice to demonstrate, as an entire volume would be needed for a full explanation. First-brother and first-sister have the same mother. Second-brother and second-sister refer to the children of one’s mother’s first-sister or first-brother, and sister-mothers and sister-fathers are first-sisters and first-brothers of one’s mother. Greatfather or <a id="page_811" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>greatmother refers to the father or mother of one’s own mother, while the parents of one’s father are second greatfather or second greatmother; one is closer blood kin to one’s mother than father. Beyond this the complications grow and are thickened by such factors as the ability of close friends to adopt each other as first-brother or first-sister. When it is also considered that Aielwomen who are close friends sometimes marry the same man, thus becoming sister-wives and married to each other as well as to him, the convolutions become even more apparent.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Aiel War:</strong> (976–78 NE) When King Laman (LAY-mahn) of Cairhien cut down <em class="calibre4">Avendoraldera</em>, four clans of the Aiel crossed the Spine of the World. They looted and burned the capital city of Cairhien as well as many other cities and towns, and the conflict extended into Andor and Tear. By the conventional view, the Aiel were finally defeated at the Battle of the Shining Walls, before Tar Valon; in fact, Laman was killed in that battle, and having done what they came for, the Aiel recrossed the Spine. <em class="calibre4">See also Avendoraldera</em>; Cairhien; Spine of the World.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Aiel warrior societies:</strong> Aiel warriors are all members of one of twelve societies. These are Black Eyes <em class="calibre4">(Seia Doon)</em>, Brothers of the Eagle <em class="calibre4">(Far Aldazar Din)</em>, Dawn Runners <em class="calibre4">(Rahien Sorei)</em>, Knife Hands <em class="calibre4">(Sovin Nai)</em>, Maidens of the Spear <em class="calibre4">(Far Dareis Mai)</em>, Mountain Dancers <em class="calibre4">(Hama N’dore)</em>, Night Spears <em class="calibre4">(Cor Darei)</em>, Red Shields <em class="calibre4">(Aethan Dor)</em>, Stone Dogs <em class="calibre4">(Shae’en M’taal)</em>, Thunder Walkers <em class="calibre4">(Sha’mad Conde)</em>, True Bloods <em class="calibre4">(Tain Shari)</em>, and Water Seekers <em class="calibre4">(Duadhe Mahdi’in)</em>. Each has its own customs, and sometimes specific duties. For example, Red Shields act as police, and Stone Dogs are often used as rearguards during retreats, while Maidens are often scouts. Aiel clans frequently raid and battle one another, but members of the same society will not fight each other even if their clans do so. Thus there are always lines of contact between the clans, even during open warfare. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Aiel; Aiel Waste; <em class="calibre4">Far Dareis Mai</em>.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Aiel Waste:</strong> Harsh, rugged and all-but-waterless land east of the Spine of the World. Called the Three-fold Land by the Aiel. Few outsiders enter; the Aiel consider themselves at war with all other peoples and do not welcome strangers. Only peddlers, gleemen, and the Tuatha’an are allowed safe entry, although Aiel avoid all contact with the Tuatha’an, whom they call “the Lost Ones.” No maps of the Waste itself are known to exist.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Ajah</strong> (AH-jah): Societies among the Aes Sedai, seven in number and designated by colors: Blue, Red, White, Green, Brown, Yellow and Gray. <a id="page_812" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>All Aes Sedai except the Amyrlin Seat belong to one. Each follows a specific philosophy of the use of the One Power and the purposes of the Aes Sedai. The Red Ajah bends its energies to finding men who can channel, and to gentling them. The Brown forsakes the mundane world and dedicates itself to seeking knowledge, while the White, largely eschewing both the world and the value of worldly knowledge, devotes itself to questions of philosophy and truth. The Green Ajah (called the Battle Ajah during the Trolloc Wars) holds itself ready for Tarmon Gai’don, the Yellow concentrates on the study of Healing, and Blue sisters involve themselves with causes and justice. The Gray are mediators, seeking harmony and consensus. Rumors of a Black Ajah, dedicated to serving the Dark One, are officially denied.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Alviarin Freidhen</strong> (ahl-vee-AH-rihn FREYE-dhehn): An Aes Sedai of the White Ajah, now raised to Keeper of the Chronicles, second only to the Amyrlin Seat among Aes Sedai. A woman of cold logic and colder ambition.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Amadicia</strong> (ah-mah-DEE-cee-ah): A nation lying south of the Mountains of Mist, between Tarabon and Altara. Its capital Amador (AH-mah-door) is the home of the Children of the Light, whose Lord Captain Commander has, in fact if not in name, more power than the king. Anyone with the ability to channel is outlawed in Amadicia; by law they are to be imprisoned or exiled, but in actuality are often killed while “resisting arrest.” The banner of Amadicia is a six-pointed silver star overlaid on a red thistle on a field of blue. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> channel; Children of the Light.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Amyrlin Seat</strong> (AHM-ehr-lin SEAT): (1) Leader of the Aes Sedai. Elected for life by the Hall of the Tower, which consists of three representatives (called Sitters, as in “a Sitter for the Green”) from each Ajah. The Amyrlin Seat has, theoretically, supreme authority among the Aes Sedai, and ranks as the equal of a king or queen. A slightly less formal usage is “the Amyrlin.” (2) The throne on which the leader of the Aes Sedai sits.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Amys</strong> (ah-MEESE): Wise One of Cold Rocks Hold, and a dreamwalker. An Aiel of the Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel. Wife of Rhuarc, sister-wife to Lian (lee-AHN), who is roofmistress of Cold Rocks Hold. Amys is sister-mother to Aviendha.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Andor</strong> (AN-door): A wealthy land which stretches from the Mountains of Mist to the River Erinin, at least on a map, though the queen’s control <a id="page_813" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>has not reached further west than the River Manetherendrelle in several generations. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Daughter-Heir.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">angreal</em></strong> (anh-gree-AHL): Remnants of the Age of Legends that allow anyone capable of channeling to handle a greater amount of the Power than is safe or even possible unaided. Some were made for use by women, others by men. Rumors of <em class="calibre4">angreal</em> usable by both men and women have never been confirmed. Their making is no longer known, and few remain in existence. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> channel; <em class="calibre4">sa’angreal</em>;<em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em>.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Arad Doman</strong> (AH-rad do-MAHN): Nation on the Aryth Ocean. Presently racked by civil war and simultaneously by wars against those who have declared for the Dragon Reborn and against Tarabon. Most Domani merchants are women, and according to the saying, to “let a man trade with a Domani” is to do something extremely foolish. Domani women are famous—or infamous—for their beauty, seductiveness, and scandalous clothes.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Artur Hawkwing:</strong> Legendary king, Artur Paendrag Tanreall (AHR-tuhr PAY-ehn-DRAG tahn-REE-ahl). Ruled FY 943–94. United all lands west of the Spine of the World. Sent armies across the Aryth Ocean (FY 992), but contact with these was lost at his death, which set off the War of the Hundred Years. His sign was a golden hawk in flight. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> War of the Hundred Years.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">Avendesora</em></strong> (AH-vehn-deh-SO-rah): In the Old Tongue, “the Tree of Life.” Mentioned in many stories and legends, which give various locations. Its true location is known to only a few.</p>

Supposedly carried a silver bow and silver arrows with which she never missed. One of the heroes to be called back when the Horn of Valere is sounded. Always linked with the hero-swordsman Gaidal Cain. Except for her beauty and skill with a bow, she is little like the stories of her. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Cain, Gaidal; Horn of Valere.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Breaking of the World:</strong> During the Time of Madness, male Aes Sedai who had gone insane changed the face of the earth. They leveled mountain ranges and raised new mountains, lifted dry land where seas had been and made oceans cover once-dry land. Much of the world was completely depopulated, the survivors scattered like dust on the wind. This destruction is remembered in stories, legends, and history as the Breaking of the World. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Time of Madness.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Breane Taborwin</strong> (bree-AN tah-BOR-wihn): Formerly a high-ranking lady of Cairhien, now a penniless refugee who has found happiness with the sort of man she once had servants flog out of her sight.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Cairhien</strong> (KEYE-ree-EHN): Both a nation along the Spine of the World and the capital city of that nation. The city was burned and looted during the Aiel War, as were many other towns and villages. The abandonment of farmland near the Spine of the World after the war made necessary the importation of grain. The assassination of King Galldrian (998 NE) resulted in war for succession to the Sun Throne, disrupting grain shipments and bringing famine. The banner of Cairhien is a many-rayed golden sun rising on a field of sky blue. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Aiel War.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">Callandor</em></strong> (CAH-lahn-DOOR): The Sword That Is Not a Sword, the Sword That Cannot Be Touched. Crystal sword once held in the Stone of Tear. A powerful male <em class="calibre4">sa’angreal</em>.

Extremely rigid in beliefs, and certain that only they know the truth and the right. Consider Aes Sedai and any who support them to be Darkfriends. Known disparagingly as Whitecloaks. Their sign is a golden sunburst on a field of white.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Colavaere</strong> (COH-lah-veer) <strong class="calibre14">of house saighan</strong> (sye-GHAN): A high-ranking lady of Cairhien, manipulative and scheming, which is to describe Cairhienin nobility in general, who has had so much power that she sometimes forgets her own vulnerability to a greater.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Darkfriends:</strong> Adherents of the Dark One. They believe they will gain great power and rewards, even immortality, when he is freed.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Dark One:</strong> Most common name, used in every land, for Shai’tan (SHAY-ih-TAN). The source of evil, antithesis of the Creator. Imprisoned by the Creator in Shayol Ghul at the moment of Creation. An attempt to free him brought about the War of the Shadow, the tainting of <em class="calibre4">saidin</em>, the Breaking of the World, and the end of the Age of Legends.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><a id="page_816" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14">Dark One, naming the:</strong> Saying the true name of the Dark One (Shai’tan) draws his attention, bringing ill fortune at best, disaster at worst.

<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Daughter-heir:</strong> Title of the heir to the Lion Throne of Andor. Without a surviving daughter, the throne goes to the nearest female blood relation of the Queen. Dissension over exactly who was nearest by blood has several times led to power struggles, the latest being “the Succession”—so called in Andor and “the Third War of Andoran Succession” elsewhere—which brought Morgase of House Trakand to the throne.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Dobraine</strong> (doh-BRAIN) <strong class="calibre14">of house Taborwin</strong> (tah-BOHR-wihn): A high-ranking lord of Cairhien who believes in keeping the letter of his oaths.</p>

Over the centuries most were unable to channel, but a few could. All, however, either disappeared or were captured or killed without fulfilling any of the Prophecies of the Dragon. Among those who could channel, the most powerful were Raolin Darksbane (active 335–36 AB), Yurian Stonebow <em class="calibre4">(circa</em> 1300–1308 AB), Davian (FY 351), Guaire Amalasan (FY 939–43), Logain (997 NE), and Mazrim Taim (998 NE). <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Dragon Reborn.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Dragon, Prophecies of the:</strong> Little known except among the well-educated and seldom spoken of, the Prophecies, given in <em class="calibre4">The Karaethon Cycle</em> (ka-REE-ah-thon), foretell that the Dark One will be freed again, and that Lews Therin Telamon, the Dragon, will be Reborn to fight Tarmon Gai’don, the Last Battle against the Shadow.

<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Dragon, the:</strong> Name by which Lews Therin Telamon was known during the War of the Shadow, some three thousand or more years ago.

A wielder of the Power will have a greater strength with one, or possibly two but rarely more, and lesser with the others. In the Age of Legends, Spirit was found equally in men and in women, but great ability with Earth and/or Fire occurred much more often among men, ability with Water and/or Air among women.

<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Game of Houses:</strong> Name given the scheming, plots, and manipulations for advantage by noble Houses. Great value is given to subtlety, to aiming at one thing while seeming to aim at another, and to achieving ends with the least visible effort.

<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">gentling:</strong> The act, performed by Aes Sedai, of shutting off a male who can channel from the One Power. Necessary because any man who channels will go insane from the taint on <em class="calibre4">saidin</em> and almost certainly do horrible things with the Power in his madness before the taint kills him. One who has been gentled can still sense the True Source, but cannot touch it. Whatever madness has come before gentling is arrested but not cured, and if it is done soon enough death can be averted. A man who is gentled, however, inevitably gives up wanting to live; those who do not succeed in committing suicide usually die anyway within a year or two. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> One Power; stilling.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para1z"><strong class="calibre14">High Lords of Tear:</strong> Acting as a council, the High Lords are historically the rulers of the nation of Tear, which has neither king nor queen.

<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Horn of Valere</strong> (vah-LEER): The legendary object of the Great Hunt of the Horn, it can call back dead heroes from the grave to fight against the Shadow.

By way of small example, there are many paths to gain honor in battle. The smallest is to kill, for anyone can kill. The greatest is to touch an armed and living enemy without causing harm. Somewhere in the middle is to make an enemy <em class="calibre4">gai’shain</em>. For another example, shame, which also has many levels in <em class="calibre4">ji’e’toh</em>, is considered on many of those levels to be worse than pain, injury or even death. For a third, there are, again, many degrees of <em class="calibre4">toh</em>, or obligation, but even the smallest of these must be met in full. <em class="calibre4">Toh</em> outweighs other considerations to the extent that an Aiel will often accept shame, if necessary, to fulfill an obligation that might seem minor to an outlander. <em class="calibre4">See also gai’shain</em>.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para1z"><strong class="calibre14">Macura, Ronde</strong> (mah-CURE-ah, rohn-deh): A seamstress in Amadicia who tried to serve too many masters and mistresses without knowing who they all were.</p>

Twisted offspring of Trollocs in which the human stock used to create the Trollocs has resurfaced, but tainted by the evil that made the Trollocs. They have no eyes, but can see like eagles in light or dark.

Among Myrddraal’s known weaknesses is that they are reluctant to cross running water. Mirrors reflect them only mistily. In different lands they are known by many names, among them Halfman, the Eyeless, Shadowman, Lurk, Fetch, and Fade.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para1z"><strong class="calibre14">Oaths, Three:</strong> The oaths taken by an Accepted on being raised to Aes Sedai. Spoken while holding the Oath Rod, a <em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em> that makes oaths binding. They are: (1) To speak no word that is not true. (2) To make no weapon with which one man may kill another. (3) Never to use the One Power as a weapon except against Shadowspawn, or in the last extreme of defense of her own life, or that of her Warder or another Aes Sedai. The second oath was the first adopted after the War of the Shadow. The first oath, while held to the letter, is often circumvented by careful speaking. It is believed that the last two are inviolable.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Ogier</strong> (OH-gehr): (1) A non-human race, characterized by great height (ten feet is average for adult males), broad, almost snout-like noses, and long, tufted ears. They live in areas called <em class="calibre4">stedding</em>, which they rarely leave, and they typically have little contact with humankind. Knowledge of them among humans is sparse, and many believe Ogier to be only legends, though they are wondrous stonemasons and built most of the great cities constructed after the Breaking.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Old Tongue:</strong> The language spoken during the Age of Legends. It is generally expected that nobles and the educated will have learned to speak it, but most know only a few words. Translation is often difficult, as it is a language capable of many subtly different meanings. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Age of Legends.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">One Power:</strong> The power drawn from the True Source. The vast majority of people are completely unable to learn to channel the One Power. A very <a id="page_824" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>small number can be taught to channel, and an even tinier number have the ability inborn. These few have no need to be taught; eventually they will channel whether they want to or not, often without even realizing what they are doing. This inborn ability usually manifests itself in late adolescence or early adulthood. If control is not taught, or self-learned (extremely difficult, with a success rate of only one in four), death is certain. Since the Time of Madness, no man has been able to channel the Power without eventually going completely, horribly mad, and then, even if he has learned some control, dying from a wasting sickness that causes the sufferer to rot alive, a sickness caused, as is the madness, by the Dark One’s taint on <em class="calibre4">saidin.

Once a shepherd. Now proclaimed as the Dragon Reborn, and also as He Who Comes With the Dawn, prophecied to unite the Aiel and break them. It also seems likely that he is the Coramoor, or Chosen One, sought by the Sea Folk. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Aiel; Dragon Reborn.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Rhuarc</strong> (RHOURK): An Aiel, clan chief of the Taardad Aiel.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Rhuidean</strong> (RHUY-dee-ahn): A great city, the only one in the Aiel Waste and totally unknown to the outside world. Abandoned for nearly three thousand years. Once men among the Aiel were allowed to enter Rhuidean only once, in order to be tested, inside a great <em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em>, for fitness to become clan chief (only one in three survived), and women only twice, for testing in that same <em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em> and again to become Wise Ones, though with a considerably higher survival rate. Now the city is inhabited again, by Aiel, and a great lake occupies one end of the valley of Rhuidean, fed by an underground ocean of fresh water and in turn feeding the only river in the Waste.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para1z"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">sa’angreal</em></strong> (SAH-ahn-GREE-ahl): Remnants of the Age of Legends that allow channeling much more of the One Power than is otherwise possible or safe. A <em class="calibre4">sa’angreal</em> is similar to, but more powerful than, an <em class="calibre4">angreal</em>. <a id="page_825" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>The amount of the Power that can be wielded with a <em class="calibre4">sa’angreal</em> compares to the amount that can be handled with an <em class="calibre4">angreal</em> as the Power wielded with the aid of an <em class="calibre4">angreal</em> does to the amount that can be handled unaided. The making of them is no longer known. As with <em class="calibre4">angreal</em>, there are male and female <em class="calibre4">sa’angreal</em>. Only a handful remain, far fewer even than <em class="calibre4">angreal</em>.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Seanchan</strong> (SHAWN-CHAN): (1) Descendants of the armies Artur Hawkwing sent across the Aryth Ocean, who conquered the lands there. They believe that any woman who can channel must be controlled for the safety of everyone else, and any man who can channel must be killed for the same reason. (2) The land from which the Seanchan come.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Seekers for Truth:</strong> A police/spy organization of the Seanchan Imperial Throne. Although most Seekers are property of the Imperial family, they have wide powers. Even one of the Blood (a Seanchan noble) can be arrested for failure to answer any question put by a Seeker, or for failure to cooperate fully with a Seeker, this last defined by the Seekers themselves, subject only to review by the Empress.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Shayol Ghul</strong> (SHAY-ol GHOOL): A mountain in the Blasted Lands, beyond the Great Blight. Site of the Dark One’s prison.</p>

Once Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah and later Amyrlin Seat, she was deposed and stilled. Now seeking to avoid the fate she fears.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Spine of the World:</strong> A towering mountain range, with few passes, which separates the Aiel Waste from the lands to the west. Also called the Dragonwall.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">stilling:</strong> The act, performed by Aes Sedai, of shutting off a woman who can channel from the One Power. A woman who has been stilled can sense the True Source, but not touch it. So seldom has it been done that novices are required to learn the names and crimes of all women who have suffered it. Officially, stilling is the result of trial and sentence for a crime. When it happens accidentally, it is called being burned out. In practice, the term “stilling” is often used for both. Women who have been stilled, however it occurred, seldom survive long; they seem to simply give up and die.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Stone of Tear:</strong> A great fortress in the city of Tear, said to have been <a id="page_826" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>made with the One Power soon after the Breaking of the World. Attacked and besieged unsuccessfully countless times, it fell in a single night to the Dragon Reborn and a few hundred Aiel, thus fulfilling two parts of the Prophecies of the Dragon. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Dragon, Prophecies of the.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">sul’dam</em></strong> (SOOL-dam): Literally, “leash holder.” Seanchan term for a woman with the ability to control, by means of an <em class="calibre4">a’dam</em>, a woman who can channel.

<p class="hangindent-para1z"><strong class="calibre14">Talents:</strong> Abilities in the use of the One Power in specific areas. The best known is Healing. Some, such as Traveling, the ability to shift from one place to another without crossing the intervening space, have been lost to the Aes Sedai of today. Others, such as Foretelling (the ability to foretell future events, but in a general way), are now found rarely. Another Talent long thought lost is Dreaming, which involves, among other things, interpreting the Dreamer’s dreams to foretell future events in more specific fashion than Foretelling does. Some Dreamers had the ability to enter <em class="calibre4">Tel’aran’rhiod</em>, the World of Dreams, and (it is said) even other people’s dreams. The last acknowledged Dreamer was Corianin Nedeal (coh-ree-AHN-ihn neh-dee-AHL), who died in 526 NE, but there is now another, known to but a few. <em class="calibre4">See also Tel’aran’rhiod</em>.</p>

Many can touch <em class="calibre4">Tel’aran’rhiod</em> for a few moments in their dreams, but few have ever had the ability to enter it at will, though some <em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em> have recently been discovered to confer that ability.

It ended completely only with the death of the last male Aes Sedai. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> One Power; True Source.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Trollocs</strong> (TRAHL-lohks): Creatures of the Dark One, created during the War of the Shadow. Huge of stature, they are a twisted blend of animal and human stock. Divided into tribe-like bands, among them the Dha’vol, the Ko’bal, and the Dhai’mon. Vicious by nature, they kill for <a id="page_828" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>the pure pleasure of killing. Deceitful in the extreme, they cannot be trusted unless coerced by fear.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Trolloc Wars:</strong> A series of wars, beginning about 1000 AB and lasting more than three hundred years, during which Trolloc armies ravaged the World. Eventually the Trollocs were driven back into the Great Blight, but some nations ceased to exist, and others that survived were almost depopulated. All records of the time are fragmentary.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">True Source:</strong> The driving force of the universe, which turns the Wheel of Time. Divided into a male half <em class="calibre4">(saidin)</em> and a female half <em class="calibre4">(saidar)</em>, which work at the same time with and against each other. Only a man can draw on <em class="calibre4">saidin</em>, only a woman on <em class="calibre4">saidar</em>. Since the beginning of the Time of Madness, <em class="calibre4">saidin</em> has been tainted by the Dark One’s touch. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> One Power.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para1z"><strong class="calibre14">Verin Mathwin</strong> (VEH-rihn MATH-wihn): Aes Sedai of the Brown Ajah, last known to be in the Two Rivers purportedly seeking girls who could be taught to channel. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Ajah.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para1z"><strong class="calibre14">Warder:</strong> A warrior bonded to an Aes Sedai. The bonding is a thing of the One Power: by it he gains such gifts as quick healing, the ability to go long periods without food, water, or rest, and the ability to sense the taint of the Dark One at a distance. So long as a Warder lives, the Aes Sedai to whom he is bonded knows he is alive however far away he is, and when he dies she will know the moment and manner of his death. While most Ajahs believe an Aes Sedai may have one Warder bonded to her at a time, the Red Ajah refuses to bond any Warders at all, and the Green Ajah believes an Aes Sedai may bond as many as she wishes. Ethically the Warder must accede to the bonding voluntarily, but it has been known to be done against the Warder’s will. What the Aes Sedai gain from the bonding is a closely held secret. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Aes Sedai.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">War of the hundred years (Fy 994–Fy1117):</strong> A series of overlapping wars among constantly shifting alliances, precipitated by the death of Artur Hawkwing and the resulting struggle for his empire. The War of the Hundred Years depopulated large parts of the lands between the Aryth Ocean and the Aiel Waste, from the Sea of Storms to the Great Blight. So great was the destruction that only fragmentary records of the time remain. The empire of Artur Hawkwing was pulled apart, <a id="page_829" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>and the nations of the present day were formed. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Hawkwing, Artur.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">War of the Shadow:</strong> Also known as the War of Power. Began shortly after the attempt to free the Dark One, and soon involved the whole world. In a world where even the memory of war had been forgotten, every facet of war was rediscovered, often twisted by the Dark One’s touch on the world, and the One Power was used as a weapon. The war was ended by the resealing of the Dark One into his prison in a strike led by Lews Therin Telamon, the Dragon, and one hundred male Aes Sedai called the Hundred Companions. The Dark One’s counterstroke tainted <em class="calibre4">saidin</em> and drove Lews Therin and the Hundred Companions insane, thus beginning the Time of Madness. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Dragon, the; One Power, the; Time of Madness, the.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Wheel of Time, the:</strong> Time is a wheel with seven spokes, each spoke an Age. As the Wheel turns, Ages come and go, each leaving memories that fade to legend, then to myth, and are forgotten by the time that Age comes again. The Pattern of an Age is slightly different each time an Age comes, and each time it is subject to greater change.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">wilder:</strong> A woman who has learned to channel the One Power on her own, surviving the crisis as only one in four does. Such women usually build barriers against knowing what it is they are doing, but if these can be broken down, wilders are among the most powerful of channelers. The term is often used in derogatory fashion.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Wisdom:</strong> In villages, a woman chosen by the Women’s Circle for her knowledge of such things as healing and foretelling the weather, as well as common good sense. Generally considered the equal of the Mayor, and in some villages his superior. She is chosen for life, and it is very rare for a Wisdom to be removed from office before her death. Depending on the land, she may instead have another title, such as Guide, Healer, Wise Woman, or Seeker.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para3"><strong class="calibre14">Wise one:</strong> Among the Aiel, Wise Ones are women chosen by other Wise Ones and trained in healing, herbs and other things, much like Wisdoms. Usually there is a single Wise One to each clan or sept hold. They have great authority and responsibility, as well as great influence with sept and clan chiefs, though these men often accuse them of meddling. Wise Ones stand outside all feuds and battles, and according to <em class="calibre4">ji’e’toh</em> <a id="page_830" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>may not be harmed or impeded in any way. Some Wise Ones have the ability to channel, but they do not advertise this. Three Wise Ones now living are dreamwalkers, with the ability to enter <em class="calibre4">Tel’aran’rhiod</em> and to speak to other people in their dreams, among other things. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> dreamwalker; <em class="calibre4">ji’e’toh</em>;<em class="calibre4">Tel’aran’rhiod</em>.</p>
