<p class="ct"><span class="epub-i">The Choice of a Patch</span></p>
<p class="tni">Elayne found Bashere pacing on the east bank of the river.</p>
<p class="tx">Riverbanks were among the few places that still felt alive to her. So much was lifeless these days, trees that did not put forth leaves, grass that did not grow, animals that huddled in their dens and refused to move.</p>
<p class="tx">The rivers kept flowing. There was a sense of life to that, though the plants were dreary.</p>
<p class="tx">The Alguenya was one of those deceptively mighty rivers that looked placid from a distance, but could pull a woman under its surface until she drowned. She remembered Bryne making a lesson of that to Gawyn once during a hunting trip they’d taken along it. He’d been speaking to her, too. Maybe to her primarily, though he’d always been careful not to overstep himself with the Daughter-Heir.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Be careful of currents,</span> he’d said. <span class="epub-i1">River currents are one of the most dangerous things under the Light, but only because men underestimate them. The surface looks still because nothing is fighting it. Nothing wants to. The fish go along with it and men stay out of it, all except the fools who think to prove themselves.</span></p>
<p class="tx">Elayne stepped down the rocky bank, toward Bashere. Her guards stayed behind—Birgitte wasn’t with them just now. She was seeing to the archer companies miles downriver, where they were busy pounding the Trollocs building rafts to get them across the river. Birgitte’s archers and Talmanes’ dragons were doing an outstanding job of reducing the Trolloc numbers there, but it was still only a matter of time before their vast army would pour across the Alguenya.</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne had pulled her forces out of Andor a week before, and she and Bashere had been pleased with their progress. Until they had discovered the trap.</p>
<p class="tx">“Amazing, isn’t it?” she asked, stepping up beside Bashere, who stood at the river’s bank.</p>
<p class="tx">Bashere glanced at her, then nodded. “We don’t have anything like it, back home.”</p>
<p class="tx">“What of the Arinelle?”</p>
<p class="tx">“It doesn’t grow this big until it’s outside of Saldaea,” he said absently. “This is almost like an ocean, settled right here, dividing bank from bank. It makes me smile, thinking of how the Aiel must have regarded it after first crossing the Spine.”</p>
<p class="tx">The two of them were silent for a time.</p>
<p class="tx">“How bad is it?” Elayne finally asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“Bad,” Bashere said. “I should have realized, burn me. I should have seen.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You can’t plan for everything, Bashere.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Pardon,” he said, “but that is <span class="epub-i1">exactly</span> what I’m supposed to be doing.”</p>
<p class="tx">Their march eastward from Braem Wood had gone according to plan. Burning the bridges across the Erinin and the Alguenya, they had taken out large numbers of Trollocs trying to cross after them. Elayne was now on the road that went upriver to the city of Cairhien. Bashere had planned to set up their final confrontation with the Trollocs in hills along the road that lay twenty leagues south of Cairhien.</p>
<p class="tx">The Shadow had outthought them. Scouts had spotted a second army of Trollocs just to the north of their current position, marching east, heading toward the city of Cairhien itself. Elayne had stripped that city of defenders to fill out her army. Now it was filled only with refugees—and was as crowded as Caemlyn had been.</p>
<p class="tx">“How did they do it?” she asked. “Those Trollocs couldn’t have come down from Tarwin’s Gap.”</p>
<p class="tx">“There hasn’t been enough time for that,” Bashere agreed.</p>
<p class="tx">“Another Waygate?” she asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“Perhaps,” Bashere said. “Perhaps not.”</p>
<p class="tx">“How, then?” she asked. “Where did that army come from?” That army of Trollocs was almost close enough to knock on the city gates. Light!</p>
<p class="tx">“I made the mistake of thinking like a human,” Bashere said. “I accounted for Trolloc marching speed, but not for how the Myrddraal might push them. A foolish mistake. The army in the woods must have split in two, with half taking a northeastern route through the woods toward Cairhien. It’s the only thing I can think of.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We’ve been moving as quickly as we can,” Elayne said. “How could they have overtaken us?” Her army had gateways. She couldn’t move everyone through them, as she didn’t have enough channelers to hold gateways for long periods. However, she <span class="epub-i1">could</span> move the supply carts, the wounded, and the camp followers through. That let them march at the speed of trained soldiers.</p>
<p class="tx">“We’ve moved as quickly as we could <span class="epub-i1">safely</span>,” Bashere said. “A human commander would never have pushed his forces into such a terrible march. The terrain they went through had to have been awful—the rivers they had to cross, the forests, the wetlands, Light! They must have lost thousands of Trollocs to fatigue during such a march. The Fades risked it, and now they have us in a pincer. The city could be destroyed as well.”</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne fell silent. “I <span class="epub-i1">won’t</span> let that happen,” she finally said. “Not again. Not if we can prevent it.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Do we have a choice?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes,” Elayne said. “Bashere, you’re one of the greatest military minds the land has known. You have resources that no man has ever had before. The dragons, the Kinswomen, Ogier willing to fight in battle … You can make this work. I know you can.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You show surprising faith in me for someone you have known a very short time.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Rand trusts you,” Elayne said. “Even during the dark times, Bashere—when he would look at every second person around him with darkness in his eyes—he trusted you.”</p>
<p class="tx">Bashere seemed troubled. “There is a way.”</p>
<p class="tx">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="tx">“We march and hit the Trollocs near Cairhien as quickly as we can. They’re tired; they have to be. If we could beat them quickly, before the horde to the south reaches us, we may have a chance. It will be difficult. The northern force probably wants to seize the city, then use it against us as the southern Trollocs arrive.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Could we open gateways into the city and hold it?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I doubt it,” Bashere said. “Not with channelers as tired as these. Beyond that, we need to <span class="epub-i1">destroy</span> the northern Trollocs, not just hold against them. If we give them time to rest, they will recover from their march, be joined by the Trollocs from the south, then use Dreadlords to rip open Cairhien like an overripe apple. No, Elayne. We have to attack and <span class="epub-i1">crush</span> that northern army while it is weak; only then could we possibly hold against the southern one. If we fail, the two will smash us between them.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It is the risk we must take,” Elayne said. “Make your plans, Bashere. We’ll make them work.”</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Egwene stepped into <span class="epub-i1">Tel’aran’rhiod</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">The World of Dreams had always been dangerous, unpredictable. Lately, it was even more so. The grand city of Tear reflected strangely in the dream, the buildings weathered as if by a hundred years of storms. The city walls were now little more than ten feet high, their tops rounded and smooth, blown by the wind. Buildings inside had worn away, leaving foundations and lumps of weathered stone.</p>
<p class="tx">Chilled by the sight, Egwene turned toward the Stone. It, at least, stood as it had. Tall, strong, unchanged by the weathering of the winds. That comforted her.</p>
<p class="tx">She sent herself into its heart. The Wise Ones waited for her. That, too, was comforting. Even in this time of change and tempest, they were solid like the Stone itself. Amys, Bair and Melaine waited for her. She overheard part of their conversation before they noticed her.</p>
<p class="tx">“I saw it just as she did,” Bair was saying. “Though it was my own descendants who lent me their eyes. I think we will all see it now, if we return the third time. It should be required.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Three visits?” Melaine said. “That brings change indeed. We still do not know if the second visit will show this, or the previous vision.”</p>
<p class="tx">Conscious of her eavesdropping, Egwene cleared her throat. They turned toward her, immediately falling silent.</p>
<p class="tx">“I did not mean to intrude,” Egwene said, walking among the columns and joining them.</p>
<p class="tx">“It is nothing,” Bair said. “We should have guarded our tongues. We were the ones to invite you here to meet us, after all.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It is good to see you, Egwene al’Vere,” Melaine said, smiling with affection. The woman looked so far along in her pregnancy, she must be close to delivering. “From reports, your army gains much <span class="epub-i1">ji</span>.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We do well,” Egwene said, settling herself on the floor with them. “You shall have your own chance, Melaine.”</p>
<p class="tx">“The <span class="epub-i1">Car’a’carn</span> delays,” Amys said, frowning. “The spears grow impatient. We should be moving against Sightblinder.”</p>
<p class="tx">“He likes to prepare and plan,” Egwene said. She hesitated. “I cannot remain with you long. I have a meeting with him later today.”</p>
<p class="tx">“About what?” Bair asked, leaning forward, curious.</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t know,” Egwene said. “I found a letter from him on the floor of my tent. He said he wanted to see me, but not as Dragon and Amyrlin. As old friends.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Tell him that he must not dally,” Bair said. “But here, there is something we need to speak of with you.”</p>
<p class="tx">“What is it?” Egwene asked, curious.</p>
<p class="tx">“Have you seen anything like this?” Melaine said, concentrating. On the floor between them, the rock split with cracks. She was imposing her will upon the World of Dreams, creating something specific for Egwene to see.</p>
<p class="tx">At first, she was confused. Cracks in the rock? Of course she had seen cracks in rock before. And with the earthquakes striking the land so often recently, they were probably becoming even more common.</p>
<p class="tx">There <span class="epub-i1">was</span> something distinctive about these. Egwene leaned forward, and found that the cracks seemed to empty into <span class="epub-i1">nothing</span>. A deep blackness. Unnaturally so.</p>
<p class="tx">“What is it?” Egwene asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“Our people report seeing these,” Amys said softly. “Those fighting in Andor and those in the Blasted Lands with Rand al’Thor. They appear like fractures in the pattern itself. They remain dark like that for a few moments, then fade, leaving behind ordinary cracks.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It is a very dangerous sign,” Bair said. “We sent one of ours to ask at the Borderlands, where Lan Mandragoran fights. It appears that the cracks are most common there.”</p>
<p class="tx">“They appear more frequently when the Dreadlords fight,” Amys said. “When they use the weave known as balefire.”</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene stared at that darkness, shivering. “Balefire weakens the Pattern. During the War of Power, even the Forsaken grew to fear using it, lest they unravel the world itself.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We must spread the word to all of our allies,” Amys said. “We <span class="epub-i1">must</span> not use this weave.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It is forbidden of Aes Sedai already,” Egwene said. “But I will make it known that nobody is to consider breaking that rule.”</p>
<p class="tx">“That is wise,” Melaine said. “For a people with so many rules for themselves, I have found that the Aes Sedai are very proficient at ignoring guidelines if their situation allows it.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We trust our women,” Egwene said. “The Oaths hold them; otherwise, their own wisdom must guide them. If Moiraine had not been willing to bend this rule, Perrin would be dead—as would Mat, had Rand ignored the rule. But I <span class="epub-i1">will</span> speak to the women.”</p>
<p class="tx">Balefire bothered her. Not that it existed or did what it did. It was uniquely dangerous. And yet, what was it Perrin had said to her in the dream? <span class="epub-i1">It’s only another weave</span> … </p>
<p class="tx">It seemed unfair that the Shadow should have access to such a weapon as this, one that unraveled the Pattern as it was used. How would they fight it, how could they counter it?</p>
<p class="tx">“This is not the only reason we sent to you, Egwene al’Vere,” Melaine said. “You have seen the changes to the World of Dreams?”</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene nodded. “The storm grows worse here.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We will not be visiting here often in the future,” Amys said. “We have made the decision. And, despite our complaints about him, the <span class="epub-i1">Car’a’carn</span> does prepare his armies to move. It will not be long before we march with him to the Shadow’s own hold.”</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene nodded slowly. “So this is it.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I am proud of you, girl,” Amys said. Amys, tough-as-rocks Amys, looked teary-eyed. They rose, and Egwene embraced them one at a time.</p>
<p class="tx">“Light shelter you, Amys, Melaine, Bair,” Egwene said. “Give my love to the others.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It will be done, Egwene al’Vere,” Bair said. “May you find water and shade, now and always.”</p>
<p class="tx">One by one, they faded from Tear. Egwene took a deep breath, looking upward. The building groaned, like a ship in a tempest. The rock itself seemed to shift around her.</p>
<p class="tx">She had loved this place—not the Stone, but <span class="epub-i1">Tel’aran’rhiod</span>. It had taught her so much. But she knew, as she prepared to leave, that it was like a river in dangerous flood. Familiar and loved it might be, but she could not risk herself here. Not while the White Tower needed her.</p>
<p class="tx">“And farewell to you, old friend,” she said to the air. “Until I dream again.”</p>
<p class="tx">She let herself wake.</p>
<p class="tx">Gawyn waited beside the bed, as usual. They were back in the Tower, Egwene fully dressed, in the chamber near her study. It was not yet evening, but the request from the Wise One was not something she had wished to ignore.</p>
<p class="tx">“He’s here,” Gawyn said quietly, glancing at the door to her study.</p>
<p class="tx">“Then let us meet him,” Egwene said. She prepared herself, rising, smoothing her skirt. She nodded to Gawyn, and they stepped out and went to meet the Dragon Reborn.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand smiled when he saw her. He waited inside with two Maidens she did not know.</p>
<p class="tx">“What is this about?” Egwene asked tiredly. “Convincing me to break the seals?”</p>
<p class="tx">“You’ve grown cynical,” Rand noted.</p>
<p class="tx">“The last two times we met,” Egwene said, “you pointedly tried to infuriate me. Am I not to expect it again?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I am not trying to infuriate you,” Rand said. “Look, here.” He pulled something from his pocket. A hair ribbon. He held it out to her. “You always looked forward so to being able to braid your hair.”</p>
<p class="tx">“So now you imply I’m a child?” Egwene asked, exasperated. Gawyn rested a hand on her shoulder, comforting.</p>
<p class="tx">“What? No!” Rand sighed. “Light, Egwene. I want to make amends. You’re like a sister to me; I never had siblings. Or, at least, the one I have doesn’t know me. I only have you. Please. I’m not trying to rile you.”</p>
<p class="tx">For a moment, he seemed just as he had long ago. An innocent boy, earnest. Egwene let her frustration melt away. “Rand, I’m busy. <span class="epub-i1">We</span> are busy. There isn’t time for things like this. Your armies are impatient.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Their time will soon come,” Rand said, growing harder. “Before this is through, they will wonder why they were so eager, and will look with longing at these restful days waiting.” He still held the ribbon in his hand, forming a fist. “I just … I didn’t want to go to my fight with our last meeting having been an argument, even if it was an important one.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Oh, Rand,” Egwene said. She stepped forward, taking the ribbon. She embraced him. Light, but he’d been difficult to deal with lately—but she’d thought the same thing about her parents on occasion. “I support you. It doesn’t mean I’m going to do as you say with the seals, but I <span class="epub-i1">do</span> support you.”</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene released Rand. She would <span class="epub-i1">not</span> be teary-eyed. Even if it did seem like a last parting for them.</p>
<p class="tx">“Wait,” Gawyn said. “Sibling? You have a sibling?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I am the son of Tigraine,” Rand said, shrugging, “born after she went to the Waste and became a Maiden.”</p>
<p class="tx">Gawyn looked stunned, though Egwene had figured this out ages ago. “You are Galad’s <span class="epub-i1">brother</span>?” Gawyn asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“Half-brother,” Rand said. “Not that it would probably mean much to a Whitecloak. We had the same mother. His father, like yours, was Taringail, but mine was an Aiel.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I think Galad would surprise you,” Gawyn said softly. “But Elayne…”</p>
<p class="tx">“Not to tell you your own family history, but Elayne is not related to me.” Rand turned to Egwene. “May I see them? The seals. Before I go to Shayol Ghul, I would look upon them one last time. I promise not to do anything with them.”</p>
<p class="tx">Reluctantly, she fished them from the pouch at her waist where she often kept them. Gawyn, still looking stunned, walked to the window and pushed it open, letting light into the room. The White Tower felt still … silent. Its armies were gone, its masters at war.</p>
<p class="tx">She unwrapped the first seal and handed it to Rand. She would not give him all of them at once. Just in case. She did trust his word; it was Rand after all, but … just in case.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand held up the seal, staring at it, as if seeking wisdom in that sinuous line. “I crafted these,” he whispered. “I made them to never break. But I knew, as I did it, that they would eventually fail. Everything eventually fails when he touches it…”</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene hefted another of the seals, holding it gingerly. It would not do to break the thing by accident. She kept them wrapped and the pouch stuffed with cloth; she worried about breaking them while carrying them, but Moiraine had indicated that Egwene would break them.</p>
<p class="tx">She felt that was foolish, but the words she had read, the things Moiraine had said … Well, if the moment did come to break them, Egwene would need to have them at hand. And so she carried them—carried with her the potential death of the world itself.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand suddenly went as white as a sheet. “Egwene,” he said. “This does not fool me.”</p>
<p class="tx">“What doesn’t?”</p>
<p class="tx">He looked at her. “This is a fake. Please, it is all right. Tell me the truth. You made a copy and gave it to me.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I did nothing of the sort,” she said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Oh … Oh, <span class="epub-i1">Light</span>.” Rand raised the seal again. “It’s a fake.”</p>
<p class="tx">“What!” Egwene snatched it from his hand, feeling it. She sensed nothing wrong. “How can you be sure?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I made them,” Rand said. “I know my handiwork. That is <span class="epub-i1">not</span> one of the seals. It is … Light, someone took them.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’ve had these with me each moment since you gave them to me!” Egwene said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Then it happened before,” Rand whispered. “I didn’t look them over carefully after I fetched them. He knew, somehow, where I’d put them.” Taking the other one from her, he shook his head. “It’s not real either.” He took the third. “Nor this one.”</p>
<p class="tx">He looked at her. “He has them, Egwene. He’s stolen them back, somehow. The Dark One holds the keys to his own prison.”</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">For much of Mat’s life, he had wished that people would not look at him so much. They gave him frowns at the trouble he had ostensibly caused—trouble that really was not his fault—and glances of disapproval when he walked about completely innocent, trying his best to be pleasant. Every boy filched a pie now and then. No harm in it. It was practically expected.</p>
<p class="tx">Normal life had been harder for Mat than for other boys. For no good reason, everyone watched him extra carefully. Perrin could have stolen pies all day, and people would have just smiled at him and maybe mussed his hair. Mat they came at with the broom.</p>
<p class="tx">When he entered a place to dice, he drew looks. People watched him as they would watch a cheater—though he never was—or with envy in their eyes. Yes, he had always figured that <span class="epub-i1">not</span> being watched would be a grand situation. A cause for real celebration.</p>
<p class="tx">Now he had it, and it made him sick.</p>
<p class="tx">“You can look at me,” Mat protested. “Really. Burn you, it’s all right!”</p>
<p class="tx">“My eyes would be lowered,” the serving woman said as she piled fabric on the low table against the wall.</p>
<p class="tx">“Your eyes are <span class="epub-i1">already</span> lowered! They’re staring at the bloody floor, aren’t they? I want you to raise them.”</p>
<p class="tx">The Seanchan continued her work. She was of fair skin with freckles under her eyes, not too bad to look at, though he was more in favor of darker shades these days. He still would not have minded if this girl showed him a smile. How could he talk to a woman if he could not try to make her smile?</p>
<p class="tx">A few other servants entered, eyes downcast, carrying other folds of fabric. Mat stood in what were apparently “his” chambers in the palace. They were more numerous than he would ever need. Perhaps Talmanes and some of the Band could move in with him and keep the place from feeling so empty.</p>
<p class="tx">Mat sauntered over to the window. Below, in the Mol Hara, an army organized. It was going to take longer than he wanted. Galgan—Mat had only met the man briefly, and he did not trust the fellow, no matter what Tuon said about his assassins not being intended to succeed—was gathering the Seanchan forces from the borders, but too slowly. He worried about losing Almoth Plain with the withdrawal.</p>
<p class="tx">Well, he had better listen to reason. Mat had little reason to like the man already, but if he delayed in this … </p>
<p class="tx">“Honored One?” the serving girl asked.</p>
<p class="tx">Mat turned, raising an eyebrow. Several <span class="epub-i1">da’covale</span> had entered with the last of the fabric, and Mat found himself blushing. They hardly wore any clothing at all, and what they did wear was transparent. He could look, though, could he not? They would not wear clothing like that if a man was not supposed to look. What would Tuon think?</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">She doesn’t own me,</span> Mat thought, determined. <span class="epub-i1">I will</span> not <span class="epub-i1">be husbandly.</span></p>
<p class="tx">The freckled servant—she was <span class="epub-i1">so’jhin</span>, half of her head shaved—gestured toward a person who had entered behind the <span class="epub-i1">da’covale</span>, a middle-aged woman with her dark hair in a bun, none of her head shaved. She was squat, shaped kind of like a bell, with a grandmotherly air.</p>
<p class="tx">The newcomer inspected him. Finally someone who would look at him! If only her face did not have the expression of one studying horses at the market.</p>
<p class="tx">“Black for his new station,” the woman said, clapping her hands once. “Green for his heritage. A deep forest, in moderation. Someone bring me a variety of eyepatches, and someone else burn that hat.”</p>
<p class="tx">“What?” Mat exclaimed. Servants swarmed around him, picking at his clothing. “Wait, now. What is this?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Your new regalia, Honored One,” the woman said. “I am Nata, and I will be your personal tailor.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You aren’t burning my hat,” Mat said. “Try, and we’ll bloody well see if you can fly from four stories up. Do you understand me?”</p>
<p class="tx">The woman hesitated. “Yes, Honored One. Do not burn his clothing. Keep it safe, should it be needed.” She seemed doubtful it ever would be.</p>
<p class="tx">Mat opened his mouth to complain further, and then one of the <span class="epub-i1">da’covale</span> opened a box. Jewelry shone inside it. Rubies, emeralds, firedrops. Mat’s breath caught in his throat. There was a <span class="epub-i1">fortune</span> in there!</p>
<p class="tx">He was so stunned that he almost did not notice that the servants were undressing him. They pulled at his shirt, and Mat let them. Although he held on to his scarf, he was not bashful. That blush on his cheeks had nothing to do with his trousers being taken off. He was just surprised at the jewelry.</p>
<p class="tx">Then one of the young <span class="epub-i1">da’covale</span> reached for Mat’s smallclothes.</p>
<p class="tx">“You’d be real funny without any fingers,” Mat growled.</p>
<p class="tx">The <span class="epub-i1">da’covale</span> looked up—his eyes widening, face paling. He immediately looked down again, bowing, backing away. Mat was not bashful, but the smallclothes were far enough.</p>
<p class="tx">Nata clicked her tongue. Her servants began draping Mat in fine cloth, black and deep green—so dark it was nearly black itself. “We shall tailor you outfits for military expression, court attendance, private functions, and civic appearances. It—”</p>
<p class="tx">“No,” Mat said. “Military only.”</p>
<p class="tx">“But—”</p>
<p class="tx">“We’re at the bloody Last Battle, woman,” Mat said. “If we survive this, you can make me a bloody feastday cap. Until then, we’re at war, and I don’t need anything else.”</p>
<p class="tx">She nodded.</p>
<p class="tx">Mat reluctantly stood with arms out to the sides, letting them drape him in the fabric, taking measurements. If he had to put up with this business of being called “Honored One” and “Highness,” then he could at least make certain he was dressed in a reasonable way.</p>
<p class="tx">In truth, he <span class="epub-i1">had</span> been growing tired of the same old clothing. There did not seem to be much lace used by the Seanchan tailor, which was a shame, but Mat did not want to correct her in doing her job. He could not complain about every little thing. Nobody liked a complainer, least of all Mat.</p>
<p class="tx">As they dealt with the measurements, a servant approached with a small, velvet-lined case displaying a variety of eyepatches. He hesitated, considering; some were marked with gemstones, others painted with designs.</p>
<p class="tx">“That one,” he said, pointing at the least ornamented patch. Simple black with only two small rubies, cut thin and long, set at the right and left edges of the patch opposite one another. They fitted it on him as the other servants finished measuring.</p>
<p class="tx">That done, the tailor had her servants dress him in a costume she had brought. Apparently, he was not going to be allowed back to his old clothing while he waited for his new outfits to be tailored.</p>
<p class="tx">The clothing started off simple enough. A silk robe of fine weave. Mat would have preferred trousers, but the robe was comfortable. However, they overlaid it with a larger, stiffer robe. It was also silk, of dark green, every inch of it embroidered with scrollwork patterns. The sleeves were large enough to trot a horse through, and they felt heavy and bulky.</p>
<p class="tx">“I thought I said to give me warrior’s clothing!” he said.</p>
<p class="tx">“This is a ceremonial warrior’s uniform for a member of the Imperial family, Highness,” Nata said. “Many will see you as an outsider, and though nobody would question your loyalty, it would be well for our soldiers to see you as Prince of the Ravens first and an outlander second. Would you agree?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I suppose,” Mat said.</p>
<p class="tx">The servants continued, buckling on an ornate girdle and placing forearm bands of the same design on his arms inside the large sleeves. That was all right, Mat supposed, as the girdle pulled in the waist of the clothing and kept it from feeling quite so bulky.</p>
<p class="tx">Unfortunately, the next piece of clothing was the most ridiculous of all. The stiff, pale piece of cloth fitted onto his shoulders. It draped down his front and back like a tabard, the sides open, but they flared out to the sides a good foot each, making him seem inhumanly wide. They were like shoulder plates from heavy armor, only made of cloth.</p>
<p class="tx">“Here now,” Mat said. “This isn’t a kind of trick you play on a fellow, just because he’s new, is it?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Trick, Honored One?” Nata asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“You can’t really…” Mat trailed off as someone passed outside his door. Another commander. The man was wearing a costume not unlike Mat’s, though not as ornate, and with shoulders not quite as wide. Not Imperial family armor, but ceremonial armor for one of the Blood. Still, it was almost as lavish.</p>
<p class="tx">The man stopped and bowed to Mat, then continued on his way.</p>
<p class="tx">“Burn me,” Mat said.</p>
<p class="tx">Nata clapped and the servants began draping Mat in gemstones. They chose mostly rubies, which made Mat uncomfortable. That had to be a coincidence, did it not? He did not know what he thought of being covered in all of these gemstones. Perhaps he could sell them. Actually, if he could put these on a gambling table, he could probably end up owning all of Ebou Dar … </p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Tuon already owns it,</span> he realized. <span class="epub-i1">And I married her.</span> It sank in that he was rich. <span class="epub-i1">Really</span> rich.</p>
<p class="tx">He sat there, letting them lacquer his fingernails, as he considered what this all meant. Oh, he had not needed to worry about money for some time, as he could always gamble for more. This was different. If he already had everything, what point was there to gambling? This did not sound like much fun. People were not supposed to give you things like this. You were supposed to find a way to come to them yourself, by wits, luck or skill.</p>
<p class="tx">“Burn me,” Mat said, lowering his arms to his side as the lacquering finished. “I’m a <span class="epub-i1">bloody</span> nobleman.” He sighed, plucking his hat from the hands of a startled servant—who was walking past with his old clothing—and set it on his head.</p>
<p class="tx">“Honored One,” Nata said. “Please forgive my forwardness, but it is my place to advise on fashion, if you please. That hat looks … particularly out of place with that uniform.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Who cares?” Mat said, marching out of the room. He almost had to go out the door sideways! “If I’m going to look ridiculous, I might as well do it with style. Someone point me toward where our flaming generals are meeting. I need to figure out how many troops we have.”</p>
