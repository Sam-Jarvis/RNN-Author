<h2 class="h2b4">Reading the Commentary</h2>
<p class="para1">Min sat in Cadsuane’s small room, waiting—with the others—to hear the result of Rand’s meeting with his father. A low fire burned in the fireplace and lamps at each corner of the room lent light to the women, who worked at various busying activities—embroidery, darning, and knitting—to keep their minds off of the wait.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Min was past regretting her decision to make an alliance with Cadsuane. Regret had come early, during the first few days when Cadsuane had kept Min close, asking after every viewing she had had about Rand. The woman was meticulous as a Brown, writing down each vision and answer. It was like being in the White Tower, again!</p>
<p class="indent-para">Min wasn’t certain why Nynaeve’s submission to Cadsuane had given the woman license to interrogate Min, but that was how Cadsuane seemed to interpret it. Mix that with Min’s discomfort around Rand lately and her <a id="page_1037" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>own desire to figure out just what Cadsuane and the Wise Ones were planning, and she seemed to spend practically all of her time in the woman’s presence.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Yes, regret had come and gone. Min had moved on to resignation, tinged with a hint of frustration. Cadsuane knew quite a bit about the material Min was studying in her books, but the woman doled out her knowledge like cloudberry jam, a little reward for good behavior, always hinting that there was more to come. That kept Min from fleeing.</p>
<p class="indent-para">She <em class="calibre4">had</em> to find the answers. Rand needed them.</p>
<p class="indent-para">With that thought in mind, Min leaned back on her cushioned bench and reopened her current book, a work by Sajius that was simply titled <em class="calibre4">Commentary on the Dragon</em>. One line in it teased at her, a sentence mostly ignored by those who had written commentary. <em class="calibre4">He shall hold a blade of light in his hands, and the three shall be one.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para">The commentators felt it was too vague compared with other passages, like Rand taking the Stone or Rand’s blood being spilled on the rocks of Shayol Ghul.</p>
<p class="indent-para">She tried not to think about that last one. The important thing was that many of the prophecies—with a little consideration and thought—generally made sense. Even the lines about Rand being marked by the Dragons and the Herons made sense, looking at it now.</p>
<p class="indent-para">But what of this line? A blade of light almost certainly meant <em class="calibre4">Callandor</em>. But what of the “three shall be one”? Some few scholars claimed that “the three” were three great cities—Tear, Illian and Caemlyn. Or, if one happened to be a scholar from Cairhien, then they were said to be Tear, Illian and Cairhien. The problem was that Rand had united far more than three cities. He’d conquered <a id="page_1038" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>Bandar Eban as well, not to mention the fact that he would need to bring the Borderlanders to his banner.</p>
<p class="indent-para">But he was ruler—or near to it—in three kingdoms. He’d given up Andor, but Cairhien, Illian and Tear were directly beneath his control, even if he personally wore only one crown. Maybe this passage did mean what the scholars said, and Min was chasing nothing.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Were her studies as useless as the protection she’d thought to offer Rand? <em class="calibre4">Min,</em> she told herself, <em class="calibre4">self-pity will get you nowhere.</em> All she could do was study, think and hope.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“This is wrong,” she found herself saying out loud.</p>
<p class="indent-para">She heard Beldeine’s softly derisive snort from across the room. Min looked up, frowning.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The women who had sworn to Rand—Erian, Nesune, Sarene and Beldeine—had found themselves less welcome in his presence as he had grown less trusting of Aes Sedai. The only one he regularly allowed to see him was Nynaeve. It wasn’t odd, then, that the others had found their way to Cadsuane’s “camp.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">And what of Min’s own relationship with Rand? She was still welcome in his presence; that hadn’t changed. But there was something wrong, something <em class="calibre4">off</em>. He put up walls when she was near—not to keep her out, but to keep the real him in. As if he was afraid of what the real him would do, or could do, to those he loved. . . .</p>
<p class="indent-para"><em class="calibre4">He’s in pain again,</em> she thought, feeling him through the bond. <em class="calibre4">Such anger.</em> What was going on? She felt a spike of fear, but shoved it down. She had to trust in Cadsuane’s plan. It was a good one.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Corele and Merise—almost constant attendants of Cadsuane these days—continued their embroidery in matching chairs by the hearth. Cadsuane had suggested the <a id="page_1039" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>work to them to keep their hands busy while they waited. It seemed the ancient Aes Sedai rarely did anything without intending to teach someone a lesson.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Of the Aes Sedai sworn to Rand, only Beldeine was there at the moment. Cadsuane sat near Min, perusing her own book. Nynaeve walked back and forth, up and down, occasionally tugging on her braid. Nobody spoke of the tension in the room.</p>
<p class="indent-para">What <em class="calibre4">were</em> Rand and Tam discussing? Would Rand’s father be able to turn him?</p>
<p class="indent-para">The chamber was cramped. With three chairs on the rug beside the hearth, a bench along the wall, and Nynaeve crossing back and forth before the door like a spotted hound, there was barely room to move. The smooth stone walls made the place feel like a box, and there was only one window, open to the night air, behind Cadsuane. Light shone from the coals in the hearth and the lamps. The Warders were speaking in low tones in the adjoining room.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Yes, it was cramped, but considering her banishment, Cadsuane was lucky to have rooms in the Stone at all.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Min sighed and turned back to <em class="calibre4">Commentary on the Dragon</em>. That same phrase popped out at her again. <em class="calibre4">He shall hold a blade of light in his hands, and the three shall be one.</em> What did it mean?</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Cadsuane,” Min said, holding up the book. “I think the interpretation of this phrase is wrong.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Again, Beldeine let out a small—almost imperceptible—sniff of disdain.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“You have something to say, Beldeine?” Cadsuane asked, not looking up from her own book, a history called <em class="calibre4">The Proper Taming of Power</em>.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Not in so many words, Cadsuane Sedai,” Beldeine replied lightly. The Green had a face that some might <a id="page_1040" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>have called pretty, bearing traces of her Saldaean heritage. Young enough to not yet have the ageless face, she often seemed to try too hard to prove herself.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“You obviously thought <em class="calibre4">something</em> when Min spoke, Beldeine,” Cadsuane replied, turning a page. “Out with it.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Beldeine flushed slightly—one noticed these things, if one spent a lot of time with Aes Sedai. They <em class="calibre4">did</em> have emotional reactions, they were just subtle. Unless, of course, the Aes Sedai in question was Nynaeve. Although she’d grown better at controlling her emotions, she . . . well, she was still Nynaeve.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Beldeine said, “I simply think that the child is amusing in the way she pokes through those tomes, as if she were a scholar.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Min would have taken that as a challenge from most people, but from Beldeine, the words were matter-of-fact.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Cadsuane turned another page. “I see. Min, what was it you were saying to me?”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Nothing important, Cadsuane Sedai.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“I didn’t ask if it was important, girl,” Cadsuane said briskly. “I asked you to repeat yourself. Out with it.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Min sighed. Nobody could humiliate one more soundly than an Aes Sedai, for they did it without malice. Moiraine had explained it to Min once in simple terms: Most Aes Sedai felt it was important to establish control when there was no great conflict, so that if a crisis <em class="calibre4">did</em> happen, people would know where to look.</p>
<p class="indent-para">It was very frustrating.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“I said,” Min repeated, “that a passage is wrong. I’m reading commentary on the Karaethon Cycle. Sajius claims that this line about the three becoming one speaks of the unification of three kingdoms beneath the Dragon’s banner. But I think he’s wrong.”</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_1041" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>“And why,” Cadsuane said, “is it that you think you know more than a respected scholar of the prophecies?”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Because,” Min said, bristling, “the theory doesn’t make sense. Rand only really holds one crown. There <em class="calibre4">might</em> have been a good argument here if he hadn’t given away Tear to Darlin. But the theory doesn’t hold any longer. I think the passage refers to some way he has to use <em class="calibre4">Callandor</em>.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“I see,” Cadsuane said, turning yet another page in her own book. “That is a very unconventional interpretation.” Beldeine smiled thinly, turning back to her embroidery. “Of course,” Cadsuane added, “you are quite right.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Min looked up.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“It was that very passage that led me to investigate <em class="calibre4">Callandor</em>,” Cadsuane continued. “Through a great deal of searching I discovered that the sword could only be used properly in a circle of three. That is likely the ultimate meaning of the passage.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“But that would imply that Rand had to use <em class="calibre4">Callandor</em> in a circle sometime,” Min said, looking at the passage again. He’d never done so, as far as she knew.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“It would,” Cadsuane said.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Min felt a sudden thrill. A hint, perhaps. Something that Rand didn’t know, that might help him! Except . . . Cadsuane had already known it. So Min hadn’t discovered anything of real import after all.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“I should think,” Cadsuane said, “that an acknowledgment is due. Bad manners are not to be tolerated, after all.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Beldeine looked up from her needlework, face dark. Then, unexpectedly, she stood and left the room. Her Warder, the youthful Asha’man Karldin, followed quickly from the side chamber, crossing the room with the Aes Sedai and following Beldeine out into the hallway outside. Cadsuane gave a sniff, then turned back to her book.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_1042" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>The door closed, and Nynaeve eyed Min before returning to her pacing. Min could read a lot in that glance. Nynaeve was annoyed that nobody else seemed nervous. She was frustrated that they hadn’t found some way to listen in on Rand and Tam’s conversation. And she was obviously terrified for Lan. Min understood. She felt similarly about Rand.</p>
<p class="indent-para">And . . . what was that vision that was suddenly hovering above Nynaeve’s head? She was kneeling over someone’s corpse in a posture of grief. The viewing was gone a moment later.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Min shook her head. That hadn’t been a viewing she could interpret, so she let it pass. She couldn’t waste her time trying to unravel all of those. For instance, the black knife that spun around Beldeine’s head recently could mean anything.</p>
<p class="indent-para">She focused on the book. So . . . Rand was to use <em class="calibre4">Callandor</em> as part of a circle, then? The three becoming one? But for what reason and with whom? If he was to fight the Dark One, then it didn’t make sense for him to be in a circle with someone else in control, did it?</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Cadsuane,” she said. “This is still wrong. There’s more here. Something we haven’t discovered.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“About <em class="calibre4">Callandor</em>?” the woman asked.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Min nodded.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“I suspect so as well,” Cadsuane replied. How odd to hear her being frank! “But I haven’t been able to determine <em class="calibre4">what</em>. If only that fool boy would revoke my exile, we could get on with more important—”</p>
<p class="indent-para">The door to Cadsuane’s room slammed open, causing Merise to jump in shock. Nynaeve hopped back from the door—it had nearly hit her.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Standing in the doorway was a very angry Tam al’Thor. <a id="page_1043" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>He glared at Cadsuane. “What have you done to him?” he demanded.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Cadsuane lowered her book. “I have done <em class="calibre4">nothing</em> to the boy, other than to encourage him toward civility. Something, it seems, other members of the family could learn as well.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Watch your tongue, Aes Sedai,” Tam snarled. “Have you seen him? The entire <em class="calibre4">room</em> seemed to grow darker when he entered. And that face—I’ve seen more emotion in the eyes of a corpse! What has happened to my son?”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“I take it,” Cadsuane said, “that the reunion did not go as hoped?”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Tam took a deep breath, and the anger seemed to suddenly flow out of him. He was still firm, his eyes displeased, but the rage was gone. Min had seen Rand take control of himself that quickly, before things had started to go wrong in Bandar Eban.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“He tried to kill me,” Tam said in a level voice. “My own son. Once he was as gentle and faithful a lad as a father could hope for. Tonight, he channeled the One Power and turned it against me.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Min raised her hand to her mouth, feeling a panicked terror. The words brought back memories of Rand looming over her, trying to kill her.</p>
<p class="indent-para">But that hadn’t been him! It had been Semirhage. Hadn’t it? <em class="calibre4">Oh, Rand,</em> she thought, understanding the pain she’d felt through the bond. <em class="calibre4">What have you done?</em></p>
<p class="indent-para">“Interesting,” Cadsuane said, her voice cold. “And did you speak the words I prepared for you?”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“I began to,” Tam said, “but I realized that it wasn’t working. He wouldn’t open up to me, and well he shouldn’t. A man using an Aes Sedai script with his own son! I <a id="page_1044" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>don’t know what you did to him, woman, but I recognize hatred when I see it. You have a lot to explain to—”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Tam cut off as he was suddenly lifted into the air by unseen hands. “You recall, perhaps, what I said about civility, boy?” Cadsuane asked.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Cadsuane!” Nynaeve said. “You don’t need to—”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“It’s all right, Wisdom,” Tam said. He looked at Cadsuane. Min had seen her treat others like this, including Rand. He had always grown frustrated, and others she did it to were prone to bellowing.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Tam stared her in the eyes. “I’ve known men who, when challenged, always turn to their fists for answers. I’ve never liked Aes Sedai; I was happy to be rid of them when I returned to my farm. A bully is a bully, whether she uses the strength of her arm or other means.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Cadsuane snorted, but the words had irked her, for she set Tam down.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Now,” Nynaeve said, as if she’d been the one to defuse the exchange, “perhaps we can get back to what is important. Tam al’Thor, I’d have expected you of all people to handle this better. Didn’t we warn you that Rand had grown unstable?”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Unstable?” Tam asked. “Nynaeve, that boy is right near <em class="calibre4">insane</em>. What has happened to him? I understand what battle can do to a man, but. . . .”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“This is irrelevant,” Cadsuane said. “You realize, child, that might have been our last opportunity to save your son?”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“If you’d explained to me how he regarded you,” Tam said, “it might have gone differently. Burn me! This is what I get for listening to Aes Sedai.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“This is what you get for being wool-headed and ignoring what you are told!” Nynaeve interjected.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_1045" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>“This is what we all get,” Min said, “for assuming we can <em class="calibre4">make</em> him do what we want.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">The room fell still.</p>
<p class="indent-para">And suddenly Min realized that through their bond, she could feel Rand. Distant, to the west. “He’s gone,” she whispered.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Yes,” Tam said, sighing. “He opened one of those gateways right on the balcony. Left me alive, though I could have sworn—looking in his eyes—that he meant to kill me. I’ve seen that look in the eyes of men before, and one of the two of us always ended up bleeding on the floor.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“What happened, then?” Nynaeve asked.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“He . . . seemed to be distracted by something, suddenly,” Tam said. “He took that little statue and dashed through the gateway.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Cadsuane raised an eyebrow. “And did you see, by chance, where that gateway took him?”</p>
<p class="indent-para"><em class="calibre4">West,</em> Min thought. <em class="calibre4">Far to the west.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para">“I’m not certain,” Tam admitted. “It was dark, though I thought. . . .”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“What?” Nynaeve prodded.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Ebou Dar,” Min said, surprising them all. “He’s gone to destroy the Seanchan. Just as he told the Maidens he would.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“I don’t know about that last part,” Tam said. “But it <em class="calibre4">did</em> look like Ebou Dar.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Light preserve us,” Corele whispered.</p>
