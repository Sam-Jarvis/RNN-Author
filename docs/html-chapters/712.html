<p class="chapterOpenerText">“What is Perrin plotting, do you think?” Berelain asked as she strolled beside Faile and Alliandre.</p>
<p class="para">Faile didn’t answer. The late afternoon was softly lit by a distant sun shrouded in clouds. Soon it would make the horizon burn as it sank down for the night. In two days, Perrin would go on trial. He’d delayed specifically, she knew, to gain more time for the Asha’man to work out the strange problem with gateways.</p>
<p class="para">Their army was growing, still more people flooding to them. Scout reports indicated that the Whitecloak force was growing as well. More slowly, but still growing. In days like these, an army was a symbol of strength and—at the very least—food.</p>
<p class="para">A stand of fingeroot trees glutted themselves on the water of the stream near Perrin’s war camp. Such strange plants they were, with those roots that dipped into the water. Trunks like flowing glass that had pooled while hardening. There was nothing like them up in Saldaea. It seemed that two wrong steps here could lead you into a swamp.</p>
<p class="para">“No answer for me?” Berelain asked. She seemed distracted these days. “I’ve been thinking. Perhaps it would be good to send an envoy to the Whitecloak army. Do you think Perrin would allow me to go and speak with them? Perhaps I could make a personal appeal on his behalf.”</p>
<p class="para">She <span class="italic1">kept</span> bringing up that topic. “No,” Faile said. “You know his mind is made up on this trial, Berelain.”</p>
<p class="para">The First pursed her lips, but did not press further. The three continued their walk, accompanied by ten Maidens. Once, Faile might have complained about the attention. That was before she’d been taken so unexpectedly, and so easily.</p>
<p class="para">In the distance, she saw a small group of refugees leaving the camp, walking away to the southeast, cross-country. Before things had gone wrong with the gateways, about ten thousand had been sent to rural areas in Cairhien. All had instructions to remain quiet. Perrin didn’t want his location known yet. Women would be still, but of course the men would gossip; they always did.</p>
<p class="para">Few knew that gateways failed; Perrin had told the people that he needed the Asha’man strong, in case there was fighting with the Whitecloaks. It was true enough. Still, some refugees had asked to leave, going on foot. To these, Faile gave bits of gold or a jewel from Sevanna’s store and wished them the best. She was surprised at how many wanted to return to homes that were in Seanchan-controlled lands.</p>
<p class="para">Despite the departures, the size of Perrin’s force was swelling day by day. Faile and the others passed a large group practicing with swords. The refugees who had decided to train were now some twenty-five thousand strong. They practiced late into the day, and Faile could still hear barked orders from Tam.</p>
<p class="para">“Well.” Berelain continued her musings. “What <span class="italic1">will</span> Perrin do? Why set up this trial? He wants something from those Whitecloaks.” She stepped around a gnarled fingeroot. The First, like so many others, read much more into Perrin’s actions than there was to find. He’d be amused if he knew the plots they ascribed to him.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">And she claims to understand men,</span> Faile thought. Perrin was by no means stupid, nor was he the simple man he sometimes claimed to be. He planned, he thought, and he was careful. But he was also direct. Deliberate. When he said something, he meant it.</p>
<p class="para">“I agree with Berelain,” Alliandre said. “We should just leave, march away. Or attack those Whitecloaks.”</p>
<p class="para">Faile shook her head. “It bothers Perrin when people think he did something wrong. As long as the Whitecloaks continue to insist he is a murderer, his name will not be clear.” He was being bullheaded and foolish, but there <span class="italic1">was</span> a nobility about it.</p>
<p class="para">So long as it didn’t get him killed. However, she loved him for that very sense of honor. Changing him would be ill-advised, so she had to make certain others didn’t take advantage of him.</p>
<p class="para">As she always did when they discussed the Whitecloaks, Berelain got a strange look in her eyes, and she glanced—perhaps unconsciously—in the direction their army camped. Light. She wasn’t going to ask <span class="italic1">again</span> if she could go speak to them? She had come up with a dozen different reasons why she wanted to.</p>
<p class="para">Faile noticed a large group of soldiers trying to look inconspicuous as they rounded the inside of the camp, keeping pace with Faile and their guards on their promenade. Perrin wanted her well protected.</p>
<p class="para">“This young Lord Captain Commander,” Alliandre said idly. “He looks quite striking in that white uniform, wouldn’t you say? If you can get past that sunburst on his cloak. Such a beautiful man.”</p>
<p class="para">“Oh?” Berelain said. Surprisingly, warm color rose in her cheeks.</p>
<p class="para">“I’d always heard that Morgase’s stepson was a handsome man,” Alliandre continued. “But I hadn’t anticipated him being so…pristine.”</p>
<p class="para">“Like a statue carved from marble,” Berelain whispered, “a relic from the Age of Legends. A perfect thing left behind. For us to worship.”</p>
<p class="para">“He’s passable,” Faile said with a sniff. “I prefer a bearded face, myself.”</p>
<p class="para">It wasn’t a lie—she loved a bearded face, and Perrin <span class="italic1">was</span> handsome. He had a burly power to him that was <span class="italic1">quite</span> appealing. But this Galad Damodred was…well, it wasn’t fair to compare him to Perrin. That would be like comparing a stained glass window to a cabinet made by a master carpenter. Both were excellent examples of their craft, and it was hard to weigh them against one another. But the window certainly did shine.</p>
<p class="para">Berelain’s expression seemed distant. She was definitely taken with Damodred. Such a short time for it to have happened. Faile told Berelain that finding another man for her attentions would help with the rumors, but the Whitecloak commander? Had the woman lost all sense?</p>
<p class="para">“So what do we do?” Alliandre asked as they rounded the south side of the camp, halfway to the point from which they’d started.</p>
<p class="para">“About the Whitecloaks?” Faile asked.</p>
<p class="para">“About Maighdin,” Alliandre said. “Morgase.”</p>
<p class="para">“I can’t help feeling that she took advantage of my kindness,” Faile said. “After all we went through together, she didn’t tell me who she was?”</p>
<p class="para">“You seem to be determined to give her very little credit,” Berelain said.</p>
<p class="para">Faile didn’t reply. She’d been thinking about what Perrin said, and he was probably right. Faile should not be so angry with her. If Morgase really had been fleeing one of the Forsaken, it was a miracle that she was still alive. Besides, she herself had lied about who she was, when first meeting Perrin.</p>
<p class="para">In truth, her anger was because Morgase was going to judge Perrin. She <span class="italic1">presumed</span> to judge Perrin. Maighdin the lady’s maid might be grateful, but Morgase the Queen would see Perrin as a rival. Would Morgase <span class="italic1">really</span> treat this judgment fairly, or would she take the chance to discredit a man who had raised himself up as a lord?</p>
<p class="para">“I feel as you do, my Lady,” Alliandre said softly.</p>
<p class="para">“And how is that?”</p>
<p class="para">“Deceived,” Alliandre said. “Maighdin was our friend. I thought I knew her.”</p>
<p class="para">“You would have acted exactly as she did in that situation,” Berelain said. “Why give away information if you don’t have to?”</p>
<p class="para">“Because we were friends,” Alliandre said. “After what we went through together, it turns out that she’s <span class="italic1">Morgase Trakand</span>. Not just a queen—<span class="italic1">the Queen</span>. The woman’s a legend. And she was here, with us, serving us tea. Poorly.”</p>
<p class="para">“You have to admit,” Faile said thoughtfully, “she did get better with the tea.”</p>
<p class="para">Faile reached to her throat, touching the cord that bore Rolan’s stone. She didn’t wear it every day, but she did so often enough. Had Morgase been false that entire time they’d been with the Shaido? Or had she, in a way, been more true? With no titles to live up to, she hadn’t been forced to be the “legendary” Morgase Trakand. Under circumstances like that, wouldn’t a person’s true nature be more likely to show through?</p>
<p class="para">Faile gripped the cord. Morgase would not turn this trial against Perrin out of spite. But she <span class="italic1">would</span> offer judgment in honesty. Which meant Faile needed to be prepared, and have ready—</p>
<p class="para">Screams sounded nearby.</p>
<p class="para">Faile reacted immediately, spinning toward the woods. She instinctively anticipated Aiel leaping from the bushes to kill and capture, and she felt a moment of sheer panic.</p>
<p class="para">But the screams were coming from <span class="italic1">inside</span> camp. She cursed, turning about, but felt something tug at her belt. She looked down with a start to see her belt knife pull itself from its sheath and flip into the air.</p>
<p class="para">“A bubble of evil!” Berelain said, stumbling to the side.</p>
<p class="para">Faile ducked, throwing herself to the ground as her knife flipped through the air toward her head. It narrowly missed. As Faile came up in a crouch, she saw with a start that Berelain was facing down a dagger, one that looked—from the damage to Berelain’s shirt—to have ripped its way free of a hidden sheath inside her sleeve.</p>
<p class="para">Beyond Berelain, the camp was in a tumult. The nearby practicing refugees were scattering, swords and spears flipping through the air of their own volition. It looked as if <span class="italic1">every weapon</span> in the camp had suddenly sprung to life, rising up to attack its master.</p>
<p class="para">Motion. Faile dodged to the side as her knife came back for her, but a white-haired figure in brown snatched the weapon from the air, holding it in a tight grip. Sulin rolled, clinging to it, her teeth gritted as she wrenched it from the air and slammed it down onto a stone, breaking the blade from the hilt.</p>
<p class="para">It stopped moving. Sulin’s spears, however, pulled from their place on her back and spun in the sky, tips pointing toward her.</p>
<p class="para">“Run!” the Maiden said, turning and trying to face all three spears at once.</p>
<p class="para">“Where?” Faile demanded, picking up a stone from the ground. “The weapons are everywhere.” Berelain was struggling with her dagger. She’d grabbed it, but it was fighting her, wrenching her arms from side to side. Alliandre was surrounded by <span class="italic1">three</span> knives. Light! Faile suddenly felt lucky for having worn only one today.</p>
<p class="para">Several of the Maidens charged in to help Alliandre, throwing stones at the knives, dodging spears that lunged for them. Berelain was alone.</p>
<p class="para">Gritting her teeth—feeling half a fool for helping the woman she hated—Faile jumped in and placed her hands over Berelain’s, lending her strength to that of the First. Together, they wrenched the dagger to the side, toward the ground, where they could drive its point into the earth. When they did, remarkably, it stopped moving.</p>
<p class="para">Faile released it hesitantly, then looked up at the disheveled Berelain. The woman pressed her right hand to her other palm, stanching the blood from a cut she’d taken. She nodded at Faile. “Thank you.”</p>
<p class="para">“What stopped it?” Faile asked, heart thumping. Shouts sounded from around the camp. Cursing. Clangs from weapons.</p>
<p class="para">“The dirt?” Berelain asked, kneeling.</p>
<p class="para">Faile dug her fingers into the loam. She turned, noticing with alarm that one of the Maidens was down, though others had felled several of the flying spears. Faile tossed her handful of soil at one that was still whipping about.</p>
<p class="para">When the dirt touched the spear, the weapon dropped. Sulin saw it, eyes widening behind her veiled face. She dropped the stones she’d been wielding and took up a handful of soil, spraying it over her head as a spear drove for her heart.</p>
<p class="para">The dirt stopped it, and it fell to the ground. Nearby, the soldiers who had been following along to guard Faile and the others were having a worse time of things. They had backed into a circle, using their shields to block incoming weapons, hunkered down with worried expressions.</p>
<p class="para">“Quickly!” Faile said to the Maidens, digging both hands into the soil. “Spread the word! Let the others know how to stop the weapons!” She threw soil at the daggers beside Alliandre, dropping two with one throw, then began running for the nearby soldiers.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">“There is no need for you to apologize, Galad,” Morgase said softly. “You couldn’t have known what was happening in the Fortress of the Light. You were leagues and leagues away.”</p>
<p class="para">They sat in his tent, chairs facing each other, late-afternoon light shining on the walls. Galad sat with hands clasped before him as he leaned forward. So thoughtful. She remembered her first impressions of him, long ago when she’d married his father. The young child had simply been part of the deal, and while Morgase had adopted him, she had always worried that he felt less loved than his siblings.</p>
<p class="para">Galad had always been so solemn. Quick to point out when someone did something wrong. But unlike other children—Elayne especially—he had not used his knowledge as a weapon. She should have seen. She should have realized he’d be attracted to the Whitecloaks for their vision of a world that was black and white. Could she have prepared him better? Shown him that the world was not black and white—it wasn’t even gray. It was full of colors that sometimes didn’t fit into any spectrum of morality.</p>
<p class="para">He looked up, hands still clasped, eyes troubled. “I accused Valda wrongly. When I went to him, I said I was demanding Trial Beneath the Light because he had abused you and killed you. Half was wrong. I have done something where I was in error, at least in part. Regardless of that fact, I’m pleased that I killed him.”</p>
<p class="para">Her breath caught in her throat. Valda had reputedly been one of the greatest swordsmen alive. And Galad had bested him in a duel? This youth? But he was a youth no longer. Galad had made his choices, and she had a difficult time judging him for them. In some ways, they seemed more admirable than her own choices.</p>
<p class="para">“You did well,” she said. “Valda was a snake. I am certain he was behind Niall’s death. Galad, you did the world a service.”</p>
<p class="para">He nodded. “For what he did to you, he deserved death. But I shall need to release a statement anyway.” He rose, clasping his hands behind his back as he walked, his white clothing seeming to glow in the light. “I will explain that my accusation of murder was false, but that Valda still deserved death for his other offenses. Dire offenses.” He stopped for a moment. “I wish I had known.”</p>
<p class="para">“There was nothing you could have done, son,” she said. “My captivity was my own fault. For trusting my enemies.”</p>
<p class="para">Galad waved a hand. “There was no resisting Gaebril, if what you have heard is true. As for your captivity, you did <span class="italic1">not</span> trust your enemies. You were betrayed, like all of us, by Valda. The Children are never the enemies of a person who walks in the Light.”</p>
<p class="para">“And Perrin Aybara?” she asked.</p>
<p class="para">“Shadowspawn.”</p>
<p class="para">“No, son. I don’t like some of the things he is doing, but I promise you, he is a good man.”</p>
<p class="para">“Then the trial will prove that,” Galad said.</p>
<p class="para">“Good men can make mistakes. If you proceed with this, it could end in a way that none of us wish.”</p>
<p class="para">Galad froze, frowning. “Mother, are you implying that he should be allowed to escape his crime?”</p>
<p class="para">“Come,” she said, gesturing. “Sit back down. You’re dizzying me with that pacing about.”</p>
<p class="para">Perhaps he’d risen to the position of Lord Captain Commander only recently, but he already seemed to bristle at taking an order. He did sit, however.</p>
<p class="para">Oddly, she felt like a queen again. Galad hadn’t seen her during the hard months. He thought of her as the old Morgase, so around him, she actually <span class="italic1">felt</span> like the old Morgase. Almost.</p>
<p class="para">Niall had held her as a prisoner, but had respected her, and she had begun to think that she might be able to respect him as well. What had happened to the board where she and Niall had played stones so often? She hated to think of it broken in the Seanchan assault.</p>
<p class="para">Would Galad become a Lord Captain Commander like Niall, or perhaps someone better? The Queen in her, the Queen reawakened, wanted to find a way to bring his light out and stifle the shadow.</p>
<p class="para">“Galad,” she said. “What are you going to do?”</p>
<p class="para">“About the trial?”</p>
<p class="para">“No. With this army of yours.”</p>
<p class="para">“We will fight at the Last Battle.”</p>
<p class="para">“Admirable,” she said. “But do you know what that means?”</p>
<p class="para">“It means fighting alongside the Dragon Reborn.”</p>
<p class="para">“And the Aes Sedai.”</p>
<p class="para">“We can serve alongside the witches for a time, if it is in the name of the greater good.”</p>
<p class="para">She closed her eyes, breathing out. “Galad, listen to yourself. You name them witches? You went to train with them, perhaps to become a Warder!”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="para">She opened her eyes. He seemed so earnest. But even the most deadly and violent of hounds could be earnest. “Do you know what they did to Elayne, Mother?” he asked.</p>
<p class="para">“You mean losing her?” Morgase still harbored anger over that.</p>
<p class="para">“They sent her out on missions,” he said, voice laced with disgust. “They refused to let me see her, probably because she was out being put into danger. I met her later, outside the Tower.”</p>
<p class="para">“Where was she?” Morgase asked, eager.</p>
<p class="para">“Here in the south. My men name the Aes Sedai witches. Sometimes, I wonder how far off from the truth that is.”</p>
<p class="para">“Galad…”</p>
<p class="para">“Not all women who wield the One Power are evil inherently,” he said. “That is a mistaken tradition of the Children. <span class="italic1">The Way of the Light</span> doesn’t make that claim; it just says that the temptation to use the One Power can corrupt. I believe that the women who now run the White Tower have let their schemes and selfish plots blind them.”</p>
<p class="para">She nodded, not wishing to argue the point. Thank the Light Elaida wasn’t here to hear that logic!</p>
<p class="para">“Either way,” he said. “We will fight alongside them, and the Dragon Reborn, and this Perrin Aybara if need be. The struggle against the Shadow outweighs all other concerns.”</p>
<p class="para">“Then let us join that struggle,” she said. “Galad, forget this trial! Aybara intends to disband some of his army and give the rest to al’Thor.”</p>
<p class="para">He met her eyes, then nodded. “Yes. I can see now that the Pattern has led you to me. We will travel with you. <span class="italic1">After</span> the trial has finished.”</p>
<p class="para">She sighed.</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t do this by choice,” Galad said, rising again. “Aybara himself suggested that he be tried. The man’s conscience weighs against him, and to deny him this opportunity would be wrong. Let him prove his innocence to us, and to himself. Then we can continue.” He hesitated, reaching out and touching the white-scabbarded sword on his dressing table. “And if we continue without him, then he will rest in the Light, having paid for his crimes.”</p>
<p class="para">“Galad,” she said, “you know Lini was among the people you took from Perrin’s camp.”</p>
<p class="para">“She should have spoken up, revealed herself to me. I would have set her free.”</p>
<p class="para">“And yet she did not. I have heard you all but threatened to execute the prisoners if Perrin didn’t come to battle. Would you have actually done this?”</p>
<p class="para">“Their blood would have been on his head.”</p>
<p class="para">“Lini’s blood, Galad?”</p>
<p class="para">“I…I would have seen her among them and removed her from danger.”</p>
<p class="para">“So you would have killed the others,” Morgase said. “People who did no wrong, who were guilty of nothing more than being beguiled by Aybara?”</p>
<p class="para">“The executions would never have occurred. It was merely a threat.”</p>
<p class="para">“A lie.”</p>
<p class="para">“Bah! What is the point of this, Mother?”</p>
<p class="para">“To make you think, son,” Morgase said. “In ways that I should have encouraged before, rather than leaving you to your simple illusions. Life is not so easy as the toss of a coin, one side or the other. Have I ever told you of the trial of Tham Felmley?”</p>
<p class="para">Galad shook his head, looking irritated.</p>
<p class="para">“Listen to me. He was a brickmason in Caemlyn, a reputable one. He was accused of murdering his brother in the early days of my reign. He had enough repute, and the case was important enough, that I judged it myself. He hanged at the end of it.”</p>
<p class="para">“A fitting end for a murderer.”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes,” Morgase said. “Unfortunately, the murderer went free. One of his workers had actually done the deed. It didn’t come out until two years later, when the man was taken for another murder. He laughed at us then, as we hanged him. Felmley had been innocent all along. The real man, the murderer, was one of those to condemn him during the original trial.”</p>
<p class="para">Galad fell silent.</p>
<p class="para">“It’s the only time,” Morgase said, “where I know for certain that I hanged someone by mistake. So you tell me, Galad. Should I hang for <span class="italic1">my</span> mistake in condemning an innocent man?”</p>
<p class="para">“You did your best, Mother.”</p>
<p class="para">“And a man is still dead who did not deserve it.”</p>
<p class="para">Galad looked troubled.</p>
<p class="para">“The Children like to speak of the Light protecting them,” Morgase said, “of guiding their judgment and leading people to justice. That isn’t how it works, Galad. Valda, claiming the blessing of the Light, could do terrible things. And I, hoping for the Light’s aid, have killed unjustly.</p>
<p class="para">“I’m not saying that Aybara is innocent. I haven’t heard enough either way. But I want you to understand. Sometimes a good man <span class="italic1">can</span> do wrong. At times, it is appropriate to punish him. At other times, punishment serves nobody, and the best thing to do is to let him continue and learn. As I continued and learned, after making such a poor judgment.”</p>
<p class="para">Galad frowned. That was good. Finally, he shook his head, his face clearing. “We shall see what the trial brings. It—”</p>
<p class="para">There was a knock on the post outside. Galad turned, his frown deepening. “Yes?”</p>
<p class="para">“My Lord Captain Commander,” a Whitecloak said, lifting the flap and stepping into the tent. He was a lean man with sunken eyes that had dark patches beneath them. “We’ve just had word from the creature Aybara’s camp. They’re asking to push back the day of the trial.”</p>
<p class="para">Galad stood. “For what purpose?” he demanded.</p>
<p class="para">“A disturbance in their camp, they claim,” the Whitecloak said. “Something about wounded needing tending. My Lord Captain Commander…it is obviously a ploy. A trick of some sort. We should attack them, or at the very least, deny this pointless extension.”</p>
<p class="para">Galad hesitated. He looked at Morgase.</p>
<p class="para">“It is no ploy, son,” she said. “I can promise you that. If Aybara says he needs more time, he’s being honest with you.”</p>
<p class="para">“Bah,” Galad said, waving the messenger away. “I shall consider it. Alongside the things you have said, Mother. Perhaps some extra time to consider would be…welcomed.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">“The channelers say they are working as hard as they can,” Gaul explained, walking beside Perrin through camp as they checked the various sections. “But they say it could take days to see to everyone.”</p>
<p class="para">The sun was sinking toward the horizon, but it would probably be a long night for many of them, tending the wounded. Thousands had been wounded, though most wounds—fortunately—were not bad. They’d lost some people. Too many, maybe as many as had fallen to the snake bites.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin grunted. Gaul himself had his arm in a sling; he’d fended off his spears, only to have one of his arrows nearly kill him. He’d blocked it with his forearm. When Perrin had asked, he’d laughed and said that it had been years since he’d shot himself with his own arrow. Aiel humor.</p>
<p class="para">“Have we heard back from the Whitecloaks?” Perrin asked, turning to Aravine, who walked on his other side.</p>
<p class="para">“Yes,” she said. “But nothing specific. Their commander said he’d ‘think’ about giving us more time.”</p>
<p class="para">“Well, he’s not the one who will decide,” Perrin said, going into the Mayener section of camp to check on Berelain’s people. “I’m not going to risk a battle with a quarter of my men wounded and my Asha’man dead tired from Healing. We go to this trial when I say so, and if Damodred disagrees, he can just go ahead and attack us.”</p>
<p class="para">Gaul grunted his agreement. He wore his spears, but Perrin noticed they were strapped more tightly in place than usual. Aravine carried a lantern, though they hadn’t needed to light it yet. She was anticipating a late night as well.</p>
<p class="para">“Let me know when Tam and Elyas get back,” Perrin said to Gaul. Perrin had sent each one separately to visit nearby villages and make certain the people there—the ones who hadn’t joined a passing army—hadn’t suffered from the bubble of evil.</p>
<p class="para">Berelain had composed herself, her hand bandaged. She gave the report to him herself, from her tent, saying how many of her soldiers had been wounded, giving the names of the men they’d lost. Only six from her camp.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin yawned as he left the tent, sending Aravine to check on the Aes Sedai. Gaul had run off to help with carrying some of the wounded, and Perrin found himself alone as he walked down the path toward Alliandre’s section of camp.</p>
<p class="para">His hammer hadn’t tried to kill him. So far as he knew, it was the only weapon on anyone’s person that hadn’t responded to the bubble of evil. What did it mean?</p>
<p class="para">He shook his head, then hesitated, pausing in thought as he heard someone jogging along the path toward him. He caught Tam’s scent, and turned to meet the sturdy man as he arrived.</p>
<p class="para">“Perrin, son,” Tam said, out of breath from running. “Something unusual just happened.”</p>
<p class="para">“The bubble of evil hit the village?” Perrin asked, alarmed. “Were people hurt?”</p>
<p class="para">“Oh, no,” Tam said. “Not that. The village was fine. They didn’t even notice anything was wrong. This is something else.” Tam smelled odd. Thoughtful, worried.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin frowned. “What? What’s happening?”</p>
<p class="para">“I…well, I have to go, son,” Tam said. “Leave the camp. I don’t know when I’ll be back.”</p>
<p class="para">“Is this—”</p>
<p class="para">“It has nothing to do with the Whitecloaks,” Tam said. “I’ve been told I can’t say much. But it’s about Rand.”</p>
<p class="para">The colors swirled. Rand walked the hallways of the Stone of Tear. His expression was dark. Dangerous.</p>
<p class="para">“Perrin,” Tam said, “I think this is something I need to do. It involves Aes Sedai, and I <span class="italic1">have</span> to leave you now. I can’t say anything else. They made me swear it.”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin looked into Tam’s eyes and saw the sincerity there. He nodded. “All right, then. You need any help? Someone to go with you, wherever you’re going?”</p>
<p class="para">“I’ll be all right,” Tam said. He smelled embarrassed. What was going on? “I’ll try to get you some help, son.” He laid a hand on Perrin’s shoulder. “You’ve done well here. I’m proud of you, and your father would be too. Keep it up. I’ll see you at the Last Battle, if not before.”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin nodded. Tam hurried off toward his tent, perhaps to pack.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">It was hard to look regal while being carried atop the Caemlyn city wall on a litter, but Elayne did her best. Sometimes getting what you wanted was more important than looking regal.</p>
<p class="para">Bed rest! For a queen! Well, in order to keep Melfane from hovering over her, she’d given an oath that she would stay off her feet. But she’d said nothing about staying in her bedroom.</p>
<p class="para">Four Guardsmen carried the litter high on their shoulders. Elayne sat safely between armrests, wearing a crimson gown, hair carefully brushed, the Rose Crown of Andor atop her head.</p>
<p class="para">The day was muggy, the weather turning warm, the sky still dark with clouds. She spared a moment to feel guilty for making the poor men, in dress uniform, carry her through this early-summer heat. But these men would ride to battle in her name; they could stand a little warm weather. How often did Guardsmen get the honor of carrying their queen, anyway?</p>
<p class="para">Birgitte strode alongside the bed, and the bond indicated that she was amused. Elayne had feared she’d try to stop this excursion, but instead she had <span class="italic1">laughed</span>! Birgitte must have determined that this day’s activities—though bound to upset Melfane—were no real risk to Elayne or her babes. To the Warder, that meant this was an opportunity to see Elayne get paraded through town looking foolish.</p>
<p class="para">Elayne winced. What would the people say? The Queen, riding a litter, being marched to the outer wall? Well, Elayne wasn’t about to let rumors keep her from seeing the test firsthand, and she wasn’t about to be bullied by a tyrannical midwife.</p>
<p class="para">She had quite a view from the wall. The fields leading to Aringill lay open to her left; the city bustled to her right. Those fields were too brown. Reports from around the realm were dire. Nine fields in ten had failed.</p>
<p class="para">Elayne’s porters carried her up to one of the wall’s tower turrets, then hit a snag as they realized the poles on the litter were too long to make the turns on the stairs inside the tower; the demonstration was supposed to happen atop it. Luckily, there were alternative short handholds for just such situations. They removed the poles, switched to the handholds, and proceeded.</p>
<p class="para">While they carried her up, she distracted herself by thinking about Cairhien. The noble Houses there all <span class="italic1">claimed</span> to be eagerly awaiting her arrival to take the throne, and yet none offered more than the most flaccid support. <span class="italic1">Daes Dae’mar</span> was fully in effect, and the posturing for Elayne’s ascent—or her failure to ascend—had begun the moment Rand had mentioned that he intended the nation to be hers.</p>
<p class="para">In Cairhien, a hundred different political winds always blew in a hundred different directions. She didn’t have time to learn all of the different factions before she took the throne. Besides, if she was seen as playing the game, she could be seen as someone to defeat. She had to find a way to seize the Sun Throne <span class="italic1">without</span> mixing too much in the local House politics.</p>
<p class="para">Elayne’s litter creaked up and crested the lip of the tower’s turret. Atop the tower, Aludra stood with one of her prototype dragons. The bronze tube was quite long and set in a framework of wood. It was just a dummy, for display. A second, working dragon had been set up atop the next tower down the wall. It was far enough away that Elayne wouldn’t be in danger if something went wrong.</p>
<p class="para">The slender Taraboner woman seemed to take no thought for the fact that she was delivering a potentially world-changing weapon to the queen of a foreign country; all Aludra seemed to want was a way to get back at the Seanchan, or so Mat had explained. Elayne had spent some time with the woman while traveling with Luca’s menagerie, but still wasn’t certain how trustworthy she was. She’d have Master Norry keep an eye on her.</p>
<p class="para">Assuming, of course, the dragons worked. Elayne spared another glance for the people down below. Only then did she realize how high up she really was. Light!</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">I’m safe,</span> she reminded herself. <span class="italic1">Min’s viewing.</span> Not that she said anything like that to Birgitte, not any longer. And she <span class="italic1">did</span> intend to stop taking so many risks. This wasn’t a risk. Not really.</p>
<p class="para">She turned away before she grew dizzy and inspected the dragon more closely. It was shaped like a large bronze bell, though longer and narrower. Like an enormous vase turned on its side. Elayne had received more than one missive from the city’s irate bellfounders. Aludra insisted that her orders be carried out <span class="italic1">exactly</span> and had forced the men to recast the tube three times.</p>
<p class="para">Late the previous night, a loud crack had sounded across the city. As if a stone wall had fallen somewhere or a bolt of lightning had struck. This morning Elayne had received a note from Aludra.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">First test a success,</span> it had read. <span class="italic1">Meet me today on city wall for demonstration.</span></p>
<p class="para">“Your Majesty,” Aludra said. “You are…well, yes?”</p>
<p class="para">“I will be fine, Aludra,” Elayne said, trying to maintain her dignity. “The dragon is ready?”</p>
<p class="para">“It is,” Aludra said. She wore a long brown dress, her black wavy hair loose, coming down to her waist. Why no braids today? Aludra didn’t seem to care for jewelry, and Elayne had never seen her wear any. A group of five men from Mat’s Band of the Red Hand stood with her, one carrying what appeared to be a chimney brush of some sort. Another had a metal sphere in his hands, and another carried a small wooden cask.</p>
<p class="para">Elayne could see a similar group on the next tower over. Someone there raised a hat into the air and waved at her. Mat wanted to watch from the tower with the working dragon, it seemed. Foolhardy man. What if the thing exploded like a nightflower?</p>
<p class="para">“The demonstration, then,” Aludra said, “we shall begin. These men here will show you what is being done on the other tower.” She hesitated as she regarded Elayne. “Her Majesty, I think we should prop her up, so that she can see the display.”</p>
<p class="para">A few minutes later, they’d located some small boxes to place beneath the litter and elevate Elayne so that she could see over the tower’s crenelations. It appeared that something had been constructed on a distant hillside, though it was too far for Elayne to make out. Aludra pulled out several looking glasses and handed one each to Elayne and Birgitte.</p>
<p class="para">Elayne raised her glass to her eye. Dressing dummies. Aludra had set up some fifty of them in ranks on the far hill. Light! Where had she gotten so many? Likely, Elayne would be getting some wordy missives from gownmakers across the city.</p>
<p class="para">Mat had promised this would be worth practically any cost. Of course, that was Mat. He wasn’t exactly the most reliable person around.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">He’s not the one who lost an invaluable</span> ter’angreal <span class="italic1">to the Shadow,</span> she reminded herself. She grimaced. In her pouch, she carried another replica of the foxhead. It was one of three she’d created so far. If she was going to be confined to her bed, then she might as well make use of her time. It would be a lot less frustrating if she could channel consistently.</p>
<p class="para">All three of the replica foxhead medallions worked as the first replica had. She couldn’t channel while wearing one, and a powerful weave could overwhelm them. She really needed that original back for further study.</p>
<p class="para">“You can see, Your Majesty,” Aludra said in a stiff voice, as if unaccustomed to giving a demonstration, “that we’ve tried to re-create the conditions under which you might make use of the dragons, yes?”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Except instead of fifty dressing dummies, we’ll have a hundred thousand Trollocs,</span> Elayne thought.</p>
<p class="para">“The next tower, you should look at it,” Aludra said, gesturing.</p>
<p class="para">Elayne turned the glass to look at the next tower down the wall. She could see five members of the Band there, dressed in uniforms, waiting with another dragon. Mat was looking in the thing, right down the tube.</p>
<p class="para">“These have trained somewhat on the dragons,” Aludra continued. “But they do not have the efficiency I would like. They will do for now, yes?”</p>
<p class="para">Elayne lowered her glass as the men pulled the dummy tube back—it was on a set of wheels—and rotated it up a bit toward the sky. One poured some black powder in from his cask, then another stuffed in a wad of something. This was followed by the man with the long pole ramming it down the tube. That wasn’t a chimney brush he held, but some kind of tool used for packing.</p>
<p class="para">“That looks like the powder inside a nightflower,” Birgitte said. She felt wary.</p>
<p class="para">Aludra shot the Warder a glance. “And how do you know what is inside a nightflower, Maerion? You do realize how dangerous it is to open one of those, yes?”</p>
<p class="para">Birgitte shrugged.</p>
<p class="para">Aludra frowned, but got no response, so took a deep breath and calmed herself. “The device, it is perfectly safe. We set up the other dragon to do the firing, so there would be no danger, yes? But there would not be danger anyway. The casting is good and my calculations, they are perfect.”</p>
<p class="para">“Elayne,” Birgitte said, “I still think we’d be better off watching from the wall down below. Even if this one beside us isn’t going to be lit.”</p>
<p class="para">“After all I went through to get up here?” Elayne asked. “No thank you. Aludra, you may proceed.”</p>
<p class="para">She ignored Birgitte’s annoyance. Did Aludra really think she could hit one of those dressing dummies with her iron sphere? That was a long way to go, and the sphere was so small, barely wider than a man’s outstretched palm. Had Elayne invested all of this effort to get something that would work more poorly than a catapult? This dragon sounded as if it could throw its sphere farther, but the boulders tossed by a catapult were many times larger.</p>
<p class="para">The men finished. The remaining man touched a small torch to a fuse sticking out of the sphere and rolled it into the tube; then they turned the tube to face directly outward.</p>
<p class="para">“You see?” Aludra said, patting the dragon. “Three men is best. Four for safety, in case one falls. One could do the work if he had to, but it would be slow.”</p>
<p class="para">The men stepped back as Aludra got out a red flag. She held it up in the air, signaling the other team on the next tower down the wall. Elayne focused on them with the glass. One carried a small torch. Mat watched with a curious expression.</p>
<p class="para">Aludra lowered her flag. The soldier touched his burning torch to the side of the dragon.</p>
<p class="para">The explosive sound that followed was so powerful that it made Elayne jump. The boom was as sharp as a thunderclap, and she heard in the distance what sounded like an echo of the explosion. She raised a hand to her breast, and remembered to draw breath.</p>
<p class="para">A pocket on the hillside exploded in a massive spray of dust and earth. The ground seemed to tremble! It was as if an Aes Sedai had torn up the earth with a weave, but the One Power hadn’t been used at all.</p>
<p class="para">Aludra seemed disappointed. Elayne raised her looking glass to her eye. The blast had missed the dressing dummies by a good twenty paces, but had ripped a hole in the ground five paces wide. Did the ball explode like a nightflower to cause that? This device wasn’t merely an improved catapult or trebuchet; it was something else. Something capable of smashing an iron sphere into the ground with such force that it blew open a hole, then perhaps exploded on its own.</p>
<p class="para">Why, she could line an entire wall with these dragons! With all of them firing together….</p>
<p class="para">Aludra raised her flag again; Elayne watched with her glass as the men on the next tower over cleaned, then reloaded, the tube. Mat was holding his ears and scowling, which gave Elayne a smile. He really <span class="italic1">should</span> have watched from her tower. The reloading process took a very short time, perhaps three minutes. And Aludra said she intended to see it happen more quickly?</p>
<p class="para">Aludra wrote a set of orders and sent it by messenger to the men. They changed the dragon’s position slightly. She waved her flag; Elayne steeled herself for another explosion, but still jumped when it came.</p>
<p class="para">This time, the blast was dead-on, hitting in the very center of the rank of dressing dummies. Their tattered remnants spun through the air. The blow destroyed five or six, and knocked down a good dozen of them.</p>
<p class="para">With the ability to fire every two minutes, hit so far away, and deal such destruction, these weapons would be <span class="italic1">deadly</span>. As deadly as <span class="italic1">damane</span>, perhaps. Birgitte was still looking through her looking glass, and while her face was impassive, Elayne could feel the woman’s amazement.</p>
<p class="para">“The weapon, you find it pleasing?” Aludra asked.</p>
<p class="para">“I find it pleasing, Aludra,” Elayne said, smiling. “I find it pleasing indeed. The resources of the entire city are yours, the resources of all Andor. There are several more bellfounders in Andor.” She glanced at the Illuminator. “But you <span class="italic1">must</span> keep the plans and designs a secret. I will send Guards with you. We can’t afford to let any of the bellfounders consider the value of leaving home and selling information to our enemies.”</p>
<p class="para">“So long as they don’t reach the Seanchan,” Aludra said, “I care not.”</p>
<p class="para">“Well, <span class="italic1">I</span> do,” Elayne said. “And I’m the one who will see these things used properly. I’ll need an oath out of you, Aludra.”</p>
<p class="para">The woman sighed, but gave it. Elayne had no intention of turning them against anyone other than Trollocs and Seanchan. But she would feel much more secure about her nation knowing that she had these at her disposal.</p>
<p class="para">She smiled as she considered it, and found it difficult to contain her excitement. Birgitte finally lowered her glass. She felt…solemn.</p>
<p class="para">“What?” Elayne asked as the Guards took turns with her glass, inspecting the devastation. She felt some odd indigestion. Had she eaten something bad for lunch?</p>
<p class="para">“The world just changed, Elayne,” Birgitte said, shaking her head, long braid swinging slightly. “It just changed in a very large way. I have a terrible feeling that it’s only the beginning.”</p>
