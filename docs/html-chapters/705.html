<p class="chapterOpenerText">At night, Gawyn couldn’t see the White Tower’s wounds.</p>
<p class="para">In darkness, one couldn’t tell the difference between a beautifully intricate mural and a wall full of mismatched tiles. At night, the most beautiful of Tar Valon’s buildings became another dark lump.</p>
<p class="para">And at night, the holes and scars on the White Tower were patched with a bandage of darkness. Of course, on a night as dark as these clouds caused, one also couldn’t tell the Tower’s color. White or black; at night, it didn’t really matter.</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn walked the White Tower grounds, wearing stiff trousers and coat of red and gold. Like a uniform, but of no specific allegiance. He didn’t seem to <span class="italic1">have</span> a specific allegiance these days. Almost unconsciously, he found himself walking toward the eastern tower entrance as if to climb up to Egwene’s sleeping chambers. He set his jaw, turning the other way.</p>
<p class="para">He should have been sleeping. But after nearly a week of guarding Egwene’s door at night, he was—as soldiers liked to say—on a midnight lunch. Perhaps he could have stayed in his rooms to relax, but his quarters in the White Tower’s barracks felt confining.</p>
<p class="para">Nearby, two small feral cats stalked through tufts of grass, eyes reflecting the torchlight of a guard post. The cats hunkered low, watching him as if considering—for a brief moment—whether or not he’d be worth attacking. An unseen owl cruised in the air above, the only evidence of its passing a solitary feather that floated down. It was easier to pretend at night. Some men lived their entire lives that way, preferring the curtains of darkness to the open windows of daylight, because they let them see the world all in shadow.</p>
<p class="para">It was summer now, but though the day had been hot, the night was strangely cold. He shivered at a passing breeze. There hadn’t been any murders since the death of that unfortunate White. When would the killer strike again? He—or she—could be moving through the hallways at this moment, searching for a solitary Aes Sedai as those cats searched for mice.</p>
<p class="para">Egwene had sent him away from her door, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t be on the watch. What good was it to walk the grounds? He should be indoors, where he had a chance of doing some good. Gawyn made his way to one of the servant entrances.</p>
<p class="para">The low-ceilinged hallway inside was clean and well lit, like the rest of the Tower, though the floor was set with dull gray slate instead of glazed tiles. An open room to his right resounded with laughter and chatting, off-duty guardsmen enjoying time with their comrades. Gawyn gave them barely a glance, but then froze.</p>
<p class="para">He looked back in, recognizing some of the men. “Mazone? Celark? Zang? What are you men about?”</p>
<p class="para">The three looked up with alarm, then chagrin. They were among about a dozen Younglings who were dicing and smoking pipes with the off-duty Tower guardsmen. The Younglings stumbled to their feet and gave salutes, though he was no longer their commander. They didn’t seem to realize that.</p>
<p class="para">Celark, foremost among them, hastened over to Gawyn. He was a lean fellow with light brown hair and thick fingers. “My Lord,” he said. “Nothing important, my Lord. Just a little harmless fun.”</p>
<p class="para">“The Warders don’t like this kind of behavior,” Gawyn said. “You know that, Celark. If it gets around that you’re staying up this late dicing, you’ll never convince an Aes Sedai to take you.”</p>
<p class="para">Celark grimaced. “Yes, my Lord.”</p>
<p class="para">There was something reluctant in that grimace. “What?” Gawyn said. “Out with it, man.”</p>
<p class="para">“Well, my Lord,” Celark said. “It’s that some of us, we aren’t so sure that we want to be Warders. Not all of us came here for that, you know. Some were like you, wanting to train with the best. And the rest of us…well, things have changed now.”</p>
<p class="para">“What things?” Gawyn asked.</p>
<p class="para">“Foolish things, my Lord,” the man said, looking down. “You’re right, of course. There’s early sparring tomorrow. But, well, we’ve seen war. We’re soldiers now. Being a Warder, it’s all a man should aspire to. But some of us, we’d rather not see what we have now end. You know?”</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn nodded slowly.</p>
<p class="para">“When I first came to the Tower,” Celark said, “I wanted nothing more than to be a Warder. Now I don’t know that I want to spend my life protecting one woman, solitary, roving about the countryside.”</p>
<p class="para">“You could be Warder to a Brown or White,” Gawyn said. “And stay in the Tower.”</p>
<p class="para">Celark frowned. “With all respect, my Lord, I think that might be just as bad. Warders…they don’t live like other men.”</p>
<p class="para">“That’s for certain,” Gawyn said, eyes lifting upward, toward Egwene’s distant quarters. He would <span class="italic1">not</span> go seeking that door. He forced his gaze back down to Celark. “There’s no shame in choosing a different path.”</p>
<p class="para">“The others make it sound like there is.”</p>
<p class="para">“The others are wrong,” Gawyn said. “Gather those of you who want to remain with the Younglings and report to Captain Chubain tomorrow. I’ll speak with him. I’ll wager he could use you as a division in the Tower Guard. He lost a lot of men in the Seanchan attack.”</p>
<p class="para">Celark relaxed visibly. “You’d do that, my Lord?”</p>
<p class="para">“Of course. It was an honor to lead you men.”</p>
<p class="para">“Do you think…maybe you could join with us?” The youth’s voice was hopeful.</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn shook his head. “I’ve another path to take. But, the Light willing, I’ll end up close enough to keep an eye on you.” He nodded toward the room. “Go back to your games. I’ll speak to Makzim for you as well.” Makzim was the stern, thick-armed Warder currently leading the training sessions.</p>
<p class="para">Celark nodded gratefully, hurrying back to the others. Gawyn continued down the corridor, wishing his choices were as easy as those of his men.</p>
<p class="para">Lost in thought, he’d climbed halfway to Egwene’s rooms before he stopped to realize what he was doing. <span class="italic1">I need something to distract me.</span> The hour wasn’t too late. Perhaps he could find Bryne and chat.</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn made his way to Bryne’s rooms. If Gawyn had a strange position among the Aes Sedai, Bryne’s was nearly as odd: Warder to the former Amyrlin, general of Egwene’s conquering army, and renowned great captain. Bryne’s door was open a crack, emitting a line of light across the blue-tiled corridor. That was his habit when he was in and awake, should one of his officers need him. Many nights Bryne was away, staying at one of his command centers around the island or in a nearby village.</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn knocked softly.</p>
<p class="para">“Come.” Bryne’s voice was firm and familiar. Gawyn slipped in, then returned the door to its cracked position. Bryne sat at a rickety-looking desk, working on a letter. He glanced at Gawyn. “Just a moment.”</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn waited. The walls were papered with maps of Tar Valon, Andor, Cairhien and surrounding regions. Many bore recent notations in red chalk. Bryne was preparing for war. The notations made it clear he felt he’d eventually have to defend Tar Valon itself against Trollocs. Several maps showed villages across the northern part of the countryside, listing their fortifications—if any—and their loyalty to Tar Valon. They’d be used for supply dumps and forward positions. Another map had circles pointing out ancient watchtowers, fortifications and ruins.</p>
<p class="para">There was a methodical inevitability to Bryne’s calculations, and a sense of urgency. He wasn’t looking to build fortifications, but to use those already in place. He was moving troops into the villages he felt most useful; another map showed progress in active recruitment.</p>
<p class="para">It wasn’t until Gawyn stood there—smelling the musty scent of old paper and burning candles—that he felt the reality of the impending war. It was coming soon. The Dragon would break the seals of the Dark One’s prison. The place he had told Egwene to meet him, the Field of Merrilor, was marked in bright red on the maps. It was north, on the border of Shienar.</p>
<p class="para">The Dark One. Loose upon the world. Light! It made Gawyn’s own problems insignificant.</p>
<p class="para">Bryne finished his letter, sanding the paper, folding it, and reaching for his wax and seal. “It’s a little late for calling on people, son.”</p>
<p class="para">“I know, but I thought you might be up.”</p>
<p class="para">“And so I am.” Bryne dribbled wax onto the letter. “What is it you need?”</p>
<p class="para">“Advice,” Gawyn said, sitting on a stool.</p>
<p class="para">“Unless it’s about the best way to quarter a group of men or how to fortify a hilltop, you’ll find my advice lacking. But what is it you want to talk about?”</p>
<p class="para">“Egwene forbade me to protect her.”</p>
<p class="para">“I’m certain the Amyrlin had her reasons,” Bryne said, calmly sealing the letter.</p>
<p class="para">“Foolish ones,” Gawyn said. “She has no Warder, and there is a killer in the Tower.” <span class="italic1">One of the Forsaken,</span> he thought.</p>
<p class="para">“Both true,” Bryne said. “But what does that have to do with you?”</p>
<p class="para">“She needs my protection.”</p>
<p class="para">“Did she <span class="italic1">ask</span> for your protection?”</p>
<p class="para">“No.”</p>
<p class="para">“Indeed. As I recall, she didn’t ask you to come with her into the Tower either, nor did she ask for you to begin following her about like a hound that has lost his master.”</p>
<p class="para">“But she needs me!” Gawyn said.</p>
<p class="para">“Interesting. The last time you thought that, you—with my help—upset weeks’ worth of her work to reunite the White Tower. Sometimes, son, our help is not needed. No matter how freely offered, or how urgent that help may seem.”</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn folded his arms, unable to lean against the wall, lest he disturb a map showing orchards across the surrounding countryside. One village near Dragonmount was circled four times, for some reason. “So your advice is to let her remain exposed, perhaps to take a knife in the back.”</p>
<p class="para">“I haven’t given any advice,” Bryne said, leafing through some reports on his desk, his firm face lit by flickering candlelight. “I have only made observations, though I think it curious that you conclude that you should leave her alone.”</p>
<p class="para">“I…Bryne, she doesn’t make <span class="italic1">sense</span>!”</p>
<p class="para">The corner of Bryne’s mouth raised in a wry smile. He lowered his papers, turning to Gawyn. “I warned you that my advice would be of little use. I’m not sure if there are answers that will suit you. But let me ask this: What is it you want, Gawyn Trakand?”</p>
<p class="para">“Egwene,” he said immediately. “I want to be her Warder.”</p>
<p class="para">“Well, which is it?”</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn frowned.</p>
<p class="para">“Do you want Egwene, or do you want to be her Warder?”</p>
<p class="para">“To be her Warder, of course. And…and, well, to marry her. I love her, Bryne.”</p>
<p class="para">“It seems to me that those are two different things. Similar, but separate. But, other than things to do with Egwene, what is it that you want?”</p>
<p class="para">“Nothing,” Gawyn said. “She’s everything.”</p>
<p class="para">“Well, there’s your problem.”</p>
<p class="para">“How is that a problem? I love her.”</p>
<p class="para">“So you said.” Bryne regarded Gawyn, one arm on the table, the other resting on his leg. Gawyn resisted the urge to squirm beneath that gaze. “You always were the passionate one, Gawyn. Like your mother and your sister. Impulsive, never calculating like your brother.”</p>
<p class="para">“Galad doesn’t calculate,” Gawyn said. “He just acts.”</p>
<p class="para">“No,” Bryne said. “Perhaps I spoke wrong—Galad may not be calculating, but he <span class="italic1">isn’t</span> impulsive. To be impulsive is to act without careful thought; Galad has given everything a great deal of thought. He’s worked out his code of morality that way. He can act quickly and decisively because he’s already determined what to do.</p>
<p class="para">“You act with passion. You don’t act because of the way you think, but because of the way you feel. In a rush, with a snap of emotion. That gives you strength. You can act when you need to, then sort through the ramifications later. Your instincts are usually good, just like your mother’s were. But because of that, you’ve never had to face what to do when your instincts lead you in the wrong direction.”</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn found himself nodding.</p>
<p class="para">“But son,” Bryne said, leaning forward. “A man is more than one drive, one goal. No woman wants that in a man. It seems to me that men who spend time making something of themselves—rather than professing their devotion—are the ones who get somewhere. Both with women, and with life itself.” Bryne rubbed his chin. “So, if I have advice for you, it’s this: Find out who you would be without Egwene, and <span class="italic1">then</span> figure out how to fit her into that. I think that’s what a woman—”</p>
<p class="para">“You’re an expert on women now?” a new voice asked.</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn turned, surprised, to find Siuan Sanche pushing open the door.</p>
<p class="para">Bryne didn’t miss a beat. “You’ve been there listening long enough, Siuan, to know that’s not what the conversation was about.”</p>
<p class="para">Siuan snorted, bustling into the room with a pot of tea. “You should be in bed,” she said, ignoring Gawyn after a cursory glance.</p>
<p class="para">“Very true,” Bryne said casually. “Oddly, the needs of the land don’t submit to my whims.”</p>
<p class="para">“Maps can be studied in the morning.”</p>
<p class="para">“And they can be studied at night. And during the afternoon. Every hour I spend could mean leagues of ground defended if Trollocs break through.”</p>
<p class="para">Siuan sighed loudly, handing him a cup, then pouring the tea, which smelled of cloudberry. It was decidedly odd to see Siuan—who, because of her stilling, looked like a woman Gawyn’s age—mothering the grizzled General Bryne.</p>
<p class="para">Siuan turned to Gawyn as Bryne accepted his drink. “And you, Gawyn Trakand,” she said. “I’ve been meaning to speak to you. Giving orders to the Amyrlin, telling her what she should do? Honestly. Men seem to think that women are nothing more than their personal messengers, sometimes. You dream up all sorts of ridiculous schemes, then expect us to somehow carry them out.”</p>
<p class="para">She eyed him, not looking like she expected any response other than an ashamed lowering of the eyes. Gawyn gave that and then made a hasty exit to avoid further bullying.</p>
<p class="para">He wasn’t surprised by anything Bryne had said. The man was nothing if not consistent, and he had repeated the same themes to Gawyn before. Think instead of being impulsive; be deliberate. But he’d spent <span class="italic1">weeks</span> thinking, his ideas chasing one another in circles like flies trapped in a jar. He’d gotten nowhere.</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn walked the hallways, noting Chubain’s guards posted at regular intervals. He told himself he <span class="italic1">wasn’t</span> climbing to Egwene; he was merely checking on the guards. And yet, he soon found himself in a hallway near the Amyrlin’s quarters. Just one hallway over. He’d check on her quickly and…</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn froze. <span class="italic1">What am I doing?</span> he thought.</p>
<p class="para">A lot of his nervousness tonight came from not knowing if Egwene was properly guarded or not. He wouldn’t be able to sleep until—</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">No,</span> he told himself forcefully. <span class="italic1">This time, I’ll do as she asks.</span> He turned to go.</p>
<p class="para">A sound made him hesitate, glancing over his shoulder. Footfalls and clothing rustling. It was too late for novices, but servants might well be delivering late meals. Bryne and Gawyn weren’t the only ones who kept unusual hours in the White Tower.</p>
<p class="para">It came again. So soft, barely audible. Frowning, Gawyn slipped off his boots, then sneaked forward to glance around the corner.</p>
<p class="para">There was nothing. Egwene’s door—inlaid with gold in the shape of <span class="italic1">Avendesora</span>—sat closed, the hallway empty. Sighing, Gawyn shook his head, leaning back against the wall to slip his boots back on. He wished Egwene would at least let Chubain set guards at her room. Leaving it unwatched was—</p>
<p class="para">Something moved in the shadow just down from Egwene’s doorway. Gawyn froze. There wasn’t much of a dark patch there, only a shadow a few inches wide made by an alcove. But as he studied that patch, he had trouble keeping his eyes on it. His gaze slid free, like a dollop of butter on a hot turnip.</p>
<p class="para">It seemed…it seemed that the darkness was larger than he had originally thought. Why couldn’t he look straight at it?</p>
<p class="para">There was a flash of movement, and something spun in the air. Gawyn threw himself to the side, and steel struck stone. One boot on, he dropped the other as he pulled his sword free. The knife that had been thrown for his heart skidded across the tiled floor.</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn peered round the corner, tense. Someone was fleeing down the hallway. Someone wearing all black, a hood over the head.</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn took off after the person, sword held before him, arms pumping, gait awkward as his unbooted foot hit opposite his booted one. The assassin was extremely fast. Gawyn bellowed the alarm, his voice echoing through the silent halls of the Tower; then he cut left. The assassin would have to turn and come up the hallway here to the right.</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn burst into another hallway, charging on a heading that would cut off the assassin. He skidded around the corner.</p>
<p class="para">The hallway was empty. Had the assassin doubled back? Gawyn cursed as he ran forward and reached the original hallway at the other end. It was empty. A doorway, perhaps? All would be dead ends. If Gawyn waited until help came…</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">No,</span> Gawyn thought, spinning. <span class="italic1">Darkness. Look for darkness.</span> There was a deep patch of it by a doorframe to his left. Far too small to hold anyone, but he had that same sense of disorientation as he looked at it.</p>
<p class="para">A person leaped out, swinging a sword for Gawyn’s head. He whipped his blade into Cutting the Reeds, knocking aside the attack. The assassin was much shorter than Gawyn, so he should have had a strong advantage in reach. Yet the assassin moved with a blurring speed, sword darting at Gawyn in a series of thrusts, not using any sword forms Gawyn recognized.</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn fell into Twisting the Wind, as he was forced to act as if he were surrounded. He barely kept the attacker at bay. He could hear yells in the distance—guards responding to his call. He shouted again.</p>
<p class="para">He could sense frustration in the attacker’s moves; the assassin had expected to defeat Gawyn quickly. Well, Gawyn had expected the same, but focusing on this opponent was very difficult. Gawyn’s blows—when he could make them—hit air when they should have landed on flesh.</p>
<p class="para">Gawyn twisted to the side, raising his blade for Boar Rushes Down the Mountain. But that gave the assassin an opening; he flung another knife at Gawyn, forcing him to the side.</p>
<p class="para">The knife clanged against the wall, and the assassin fled down the hallway. Gawyn rushed after, but he couldn’t keep up. Soon the assassin was far away, darting to the left. That direction led to a series of intersections.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Such speed,</span> Gawyn thought, stopping, breathing in and out in gasps, hands on knees. <span class="italic1">It isn’t natural.</span></p>
<p class="para">Two of Chubain’s guards arrived a moment later, swords at the ready. Gawyn pointed. “Assassin. Listening at Egwene’s door. Went that way.”</p>
<p class="para">One ran where he pointed. The other went to raise the general alarm.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Light!</span> Gawyn thought. <span class="italic1">What if I didn’t interrupt him listening? What if I interrupted him on his way out?</span></p>
<p class="para">Gawyn dashed to Egwene’s door, fatigue evaporating. Sword out, he tested the door. It was unlocked!</p>
<p class="para">“Egwene!” he cried, throwing the door open and leaping into the room.</p>
<p class="para">There was a sudden explosion of light and a crashing sound. Gawyn found himself wrapped up in something strong: invisible cords, towing him into the air. His sword fell to the ground, and his mouth filled with an unseen force.</p>
<p class="para">And so it was that he found himself hanging from the ceiling, disarmed, struggling, as the Amyrlin herself walked from her bedroom. She was alert and fully dressed in a crimson dress trimmed with gold.</p>
<p class="para">She did not look pleased.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Mat sat beside the inn’s hearth, wishing the fire were a little less warm. He could feel its heat through the layers of his ragged jacket and white shirt, matched by a pair of workman’s thick trousers. The boots on his feet had good soles, but the sides were worn. He did not wear his hat, and his scarf was pulled up around the bottom half of his face as he leaned back in the mountain oak chair.</p>
<p class="para">Elayne still had his medallion. He felt naked without it. He had a shortsword sitting by his chair, but that was mostly for show. A walking staff leaned innocently beside it; he would rather use that, or the knives hidden in his coat. But a sword was more visible, and would make the footpads who sauntered through the streets of Low Caemlyn think twice.</p>
<p class="para">“I know why you’re asking after him,” Chet said. There was a man like Chet in nearly every tavern. Old enough to have seen men like Mat be born, grow up, and die, and willing to talk of all those years if you got enough drink in them. Or often if you didn’t.</p>
<p class="para">The stubble on Chet’s long face was dappled silver, and he wore a lopsided cap. His patched coat had once been black, and the red-and-white insignia on his pocket was too faded to read. It was vaguely military, and one did not usually get scars like the thick, angry one on his cheek and neck from a bar fight.</p>
<p class="para">“Aye,” Chet continued, “many are askin’ after the leader of that Band. Well, this mug of ale is appreciated, so let me give you some advice. You walk like you know which end of that sword means business, but you’d be a fool to challenge that one. Prince of Ravens, Lord of Luck. He faced old death himself and diced for his future, he did. Ain’t never lost a fight.”</p>
<p class="para">Mat said nothing. He leaned back in his chair. This was his fourth tavern this night, and in three of them he had been able to find rumors about Matrim Cauthon. Barely a lick of truth to them. Blood and bloody ashes!</p>
<p class="para">Oh, sure, there were tales of other people, too. Most about Rand, each one making the colors swirl when he heard them. Tear had fallen to the Seanchan, no Illian, no Rand had defeated them all and was fighting the Last Battle right now. No! He visited women in their sleep, getting them with child. No, that was the Dark One. No, <span class="italic1">Mat</span> was the Dark One!</p>
<p class="para">Bloody stories. They were supposed to leave Mat alone. Some he could trace back to the Band—like the story of a city full of the dead awakening. But many of the people claimed that the stories had come from their uncle, or cousin, or nephew.</p>
<p class="para">Mat flicked Chet a copper. The man tipped his hat politely and went to get himself another drink. Mat did not feel like drinking. He had a suspicion that those pictures of him were part of why the stories were spreading so quickly. In the last tavern he had visited, someone had actually pulled out a copy of the sketch—folded and wrinkled—and shown it to him. Nobody had recognized him so far, though.</p>
<p class="para">The hearthfire continued to crackle. Low Caemlyn was growing, and enterprising men had realized that providing rooms and drinks for the transients could make a healthy profit. So shanties had started to become taverns, and those had begun to grow into full inns.</p>
<p class="para">Wood was in high demand, and many of the mercenary bands had taken to woodcutting. Some worked honestly, paying the Queen’s levy for claims. Others worked less legally. There had already been hangings for it. Who would have thought? Men hanging for poaching trees? What next? Men hanging for stealing dirt?</p>
<p class="para">Low Caemlyn had changed drastically, roads springing up, buildings being enlarged. A few years, and Low Caemlyn would be a city itself! They’d have to build <span class="italic1">another</span> wall to close it in.</p>
<p class="para">The room smelled of dirt and sweat, but no more so than other taverns. Spills were quickly cleaned up and the serving girls looked eager to have work. One in particular gave him a quiet smile, refilling his mug and showing some ankle. Mat made sure to remember her; she would be good for Talmanes.</p>
<p class="para">Mat lifted up his scarf enough to drink. He felt like a fool wearing the scarf this way. But it was too hot for a hooded cloak, and the beard had been torture. Even with the scarf on his face, he did not stand out too much in Low Caemlyn; he was not the only tough walking around with his face obscured. He explained that he had a bad scar he wanted to cover; others assumed he had a bounty on his head. Both were actually true, unfortunately.</p>
<p class="para">He sat for a time, staring into the dancing flames of the hearth. Chet’s warning caused an uncomfortable pit to open in Mat’s stomach. The greater his reputation grew, the more likely he would be challenged. There would be great notoriety in killing the Prince of the Ravens. Where had they gotten that name? Blood and bloody ashes!</p>
<p class="para">A figure joined him at the fire. Lanky and bony, Noal looked like a scarecrow who had dusted himself off and decided to go to town. Despite his white hair and leathery face, Noal was as spry as men half his age. When he was handling a weapon, anyway. Other times he seemed as clumsy as a mule in a dining parlor.</p>
<p class="para">“You’re quite the notable man,” Noal said to Mat, holding out his palms to the fire. “When you stumbled across me in Ebou Dar, I had no idea what illustrious company I’d find myself in. Give this a few more months and you’ll be more famous than Jain Farstrider.”</p>
<p class="para">Mat hunkered down farther into his chair.</p>
<p class="para">“Men always think it would be grand to be known in every tavern and every city,” Noal said softly. “But burn me if it isn’t just a headache.”</p>
<p class="para">“What do you know of it?”</p>
<p class="para">“Jain complained about it,” Noal said softly.</p>
<p class="para">Mat grunted. Thom arrived next. He was dressed as a merchant’s servant, wearing a blue outfit that was not too fine, but also not in disrepair. He was claiming to have come to Low Caemlyn to determine whether his master would be well advised to put a shopfront here.</p>
<p class="para">Thom pulled off the disguise with aplomb, waxing his mustaches to points and speaking with a faint Murandian accent. Mat had offered to come up with a backstory for his act, but Thom had coughed and said that he already had one worked out. Flaming liar of a gleeman.</p>
<p class="para">Thom pulled up a chair, seating himself delicately, as if he were a servant who thought highly of himself. “Ah, what a waste of my time this was! My master insists that I associate with such <span class="italic1">rabble</span> as this! And here I find the worst of the lot.”</p>
<p class="para">Noal chuckled softly.</p>
<p class="para">“If only,” Thom said dramatically, “I had been instead sent to the camp of the majestic, amazing, indestructible, famous Matrim Cauthon! Then I would certainly have—”</p>
<p class="para">“Burn me, Thom,” Mat said. “Let a man suffer in peace.”</p>
<p class="para">Thom laughed, waving over the serving girl and buying drinks for the three of them. He gave her an extra coin and quietly asked her to keep casual ears from getting too close to the hearth.</p>
<p class="para">“Are you sure you want to meet here?” Noal asked.</p>
<p class="para">“It’ll do,” Mat said. He did not want to be seen back in camp, lest the <span class="italic1">gholam</span> look there for him.</p>
<p class="para">“All right, then,” Noal said. “We know where the tower is, and can get there, assuming Mat procures us a gateway.”</p>
<p class="para">“I will,” Mat said.</p>
<p class="para">“I haven’t been able to find anyone who has gone inside,” Noal continued.</p>
<p class="para">“Some say it’s haunted,” Thom said, taking a slurp from his mug. “Others say it’s a relic from the Age of Legends. The sides are said to be of smooth steel, without an opening. I did find a captain’s widow’s younger son who once heard a story of someone who found great treasures in the tower. He didn’t say how the lad had gotten in, though.”</p>
<p class="para">“We <span class="italic1">know</span> how to get in,” Mat said.</p>
<p class="para">“Olver’s story?” Noal asked skeptically.</p>
<p class="para">“It’s the best we have,” Mat said. “Look, the game and the rhyme are about the Aelfinn and Eelfinn. People knew about them once. Those bloody doorframes are proof of that. So they left the game and the rhyme as warning.”</p>
<p class="para">“That game can’t be won, Mat,” Noal said, rubbing his leathery chin.</p>
<p class="para">“And that’s the point of it. You need to cheat.”</p>
<p class="para">“But maybe we should try a deal,” Thom said, playing with the waxed tip of a mustache. “They did give you answers to your questions.”</p>
<p class="para">“Bloody frustrating ones,” Mat said. He had not wanted to tell Thom and Noal about his questions—he still had not told them what he had asked.</p>
<p class="para">“But they <span class="italic1">did</span> answer,” Thom said. “It sounds like they had some kind of deal with the Aes Sedai. If we knew what it was the Aes Sedai had that the snakes and foxes wanted—the reason they were willing to bargain—then maybe we could trade it to them for Moiraine.”</p>
<p class="para">“If she’s still alive,” Noal said grimly.</p>
<p class="para">“She is,” Thom said, staring straight ahead. “Light send it. She <span class="italic1">has</span> to be alive.”</p>
<p class="para">“We know what they want.” Mat glanced at those flames.</p>
<p class="para">“What?” Noal asked.</p>
<p class="para">“Us,” Mat replied. “Look, they can see what’s going to happen. They did it to me, they did it to Moiraine, if that letter is any clue. They knew she would leave a letter for you, Thom. They <span class="italic1">knew</span> it. And they still answered her questions.”</p>
<p class="para">“Maybe they had to,” Thom said.</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, but they don’t have to answer straightforwardly,” Mat said. “They didn’t with me. They answered <span class="italic1">knowing</span> she would come back to them. And they gave me what they did knowing I’d get pulled back, too. They want me. They want us.”</p>
<p class="para">“You don’t know that for certain, Mat.” Thom set his mug of ale on the floor between his feet and got out his pipe. To Mat’s right, men cheered a dice game. “They can answer questions, but that doesn’t mean they know everything. Could be like Aes Sedai foretellings.”</p>
<p class="para">Mat shook his head. The creatures put memories into his head. He figured they were the memories of people who had touched the tower or been into it. The Aelfinn and the Eelfinn had those memories, and burn him, they probably had his, too. Could they watch him, see through his eyes?</p>
<p class="para">He wished again for his medallion, though it would do no good against them. They were not Aes Sedai; they would not use channeling. “They <span class="italic1">do</span> know things, Thom,” Mat said. “They’re watching. We won’t surprise them.”</p>
<p class="para">“Makes them hard to defeat, then,” Thom said, lighting a tinder twig with the fire, then using it to light his pipe. “We can’t win.”</p>
<p class="para">“Unless we break the rules,” Mat repeated.</p>
<p class="para">“But they’ll know what we’re doing,” Thom said, “if what you say is true. So we should trade with them.”</p>
<p class="para">“And what did Moiraine say, Thom?” Mat said. “In that letter you read every night.”</p>
<p class="para">Thom puffed on his pipe, raising an absent hand to his breast pocket, where he kept the letter. “She said to remember what we knew of the game.”</p>
<p class="para">“She knows there’s no way to win when dealing with them,” Mat said. “No trades, Thom, no bargains. We go in fighting and we don’t leave until we have her.”</p>
<p class="para">Thom hesitated for a moment, then nodded, his pipe beginning to puff.</p>
<p class="para">“Courage to strengthen,” Noal said. “Well, we have enough of that, with Mat’s luck.”</p>
<p class="para">“You don’t have to be part of this, you know, Noal,” Mat said. “You have no reason to risk yourself on this.”</p>
<p class="para">“I’m going,” Noal said. “I’ve seen a lot of places. Most places, actually. But never this one.” He hesitated. “It’s something I need to do. And that’s the end of it.”</p>
<p class="para">“Very well,” Mat said.</p>
<p class="para">“Fire to blind,” Noal said. “What do we have?”</p>
<p class="para">“Lanterns and torches,” Mat said, knocking his foot against the sack beside his chair. “And some of those firesticks from Aludra, so we can light them. A few surprises from her, too.”</p>
<p class="para">“Fireworks?” Noal asked.</p>
<p class="para">“And a few of those exploding cylinders we used against the Seanchan. She calls them roarsticks.”</p>
<p class="para">Thom whistled. “She let you have some?”</p>
<p class="para">“Two. When I presented her with Elayne’s agreement, she was ready to let me have almost anything I asked for.” Mat grimaced. “She wanted to come along to light them. Herself! Burn me, but that was a tough argument to end. But we’ve got a whole lot of nightflowers.” He tapped the sack beside his chair with the edge of his foot.</p>
<p class="para">“You <span class="italic1">brought</span> them?” Thom asked.</p>
<p class="para">“I wanted to keep them close,” Mat said. “And she only gave them to me today. They’re not going to explode by accident, Thom. That doesn’t happen very often.”</p>
<p class="para">“Well at least move them back from the hearth!” Thom said. He glanced at his pipe and cursed, then scooted his chair a few inches from Mat.</p>
<p class="para">“Next,” Noal said, “music to dazzle.”</p>
<p class="para">“I got us a variety,” Thom said. “I’ll bring my harp and flute, but I found us some hand drums and hand cymbals. They can be strapped to the side of your leg and hit with one hand. I also bought an extra flute.” He eyed Mat. “A simple one, designed for those with thick, slow fingers.”</p>
<p class="para">Mat snorted.</p>
<p class="para">“And finally, iron to bind,” Noal said, sliding forward a pack of his own. It clinked faintly as he untied the top, the contents reflecting the deep orange hearthlight. “A set of throwing knives for each of us and two shortswords. Each of pure iron, no steel. I got us some chains, too, and a band of iron to clip around the butt of Mat’s spear. It might throw the weight off, though.”</p>
<p class="para">“I’ll take it,” Mat said.</p>
<p class="para">Noal did up his pack again, and the three of them sat before the hearth for a time. In a way, these things they’d gathered were an illusion. A way to reassure themselves that they were doing <span class="italic1">something</span> to prepare.</p>
<p class="para">But Mat remembered those twisted places beyond the gateways, the angles that were not right, the unnatural landscape. The creatures called snakes and foxes because they defied standard description.</p>
<p class="para">That place was another world. The preparations he did with Thom and Noal might help, but they might also be useless. There was no telling until they stepped into that tower. It felt like not knowing if you had the right antidote until after the snake’s teeth were already clamped down on your arm.</p>
<p class="para">Eventually, he bade the other two a good night. Noal wanted to head back to the Band’s camp, which was now only a ten-minute ride from the city. Thom agreed to go with him, and they took Mat’s pack full of nightflowers—though both men looked as if they would rather be carrying a sack full of spiders.</p>
<p class="para">Mat belted his sword on over his coat, took up his staff, then headed back toward his inn. He did not go directly there, though, and instead found himself trailing through the alleys and streets. Shanties and tents had sprung up beside solid buildings as the city-outside-the-city spread along the walls, like mold growing on a loaf of bread.</p>
<p class="para">The sky was dark, but the night was still busy, touts calling from within the lit doorways of inns. Mat made sure the shortsword was visible. There were many who would think to exploit a lone wanderer at night, particularly outside the city walls, where the arm of the law was a little on the flabby side.</p>
<p class="para">The air smelled of impending rain, but it often did these days. He wished it would go on and storm or bloody clear up. It felt as if the air were holding its breath, waiting for something. A blow that never fell, a bell that never rang, a set of dice that never stopped spinning. Just like the ones that thundered in his head.</p>
<p class="para">He felt at the letter from Verin in his pocket. Would the dice stop if he opened it? Maybe it was about the <span class="italic1">gholam</span>. If he did not retrieve his medallion from Elayne soon, the thing was likely to find him and rip his insides out.</p>
<p class="para">Bloody ashes. He felt like going drinking, forgetting who he was—and who people <span class="italic1">thought</span> he was—for a while. But if he got drunk, he was likely to let his face show by accident. Perhaps begin to talk about who he really was. You never could tell what a man would do when he was drunk, even if that man was your own self.</p>
<p class="para">He made his way through the city gates and into the New City. The air began to mist with something that was not quite rain, as if the sky had listened to his rant and had decided to allow a little sneeze to spray down on him.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Wonderful,</span> he thought, <span class="italic1">bloody wonderful</span>.</p>
<p class="para">The paving stones soon grew wet from the not-rain, and the streetlamps glowed with balls of vaporous haze. Mat hunkered down, scarf still covering his face as if he were a bloody Aielman. Had he not been too hot only a little bit ago?</p>
<p class="para">He was as eager as Thom to move on and find Moiraine. She had made a mess of his life, but Mat supposed he owed her for that. Better to live in this mess than to be trapped back in the Two Rivers, living a boring life without realizing how boring it was. Mat was not like Perrin, who had mooned over leaving the Two Rivers before they had even gotten to Baerlon. An image of Perrin flashed in his head, and Mat banished it.</p>
<p class="para">And what of Rand? Mat saw him sitting on a fine chair, staring down at the floor in front of himself in a dark room, a single lamp flickering. He looked worn and exhausted, his eyes wide, his expression grim. Mat shook his head to dispel that image as well. Poor Rand. The man probably thought he was a bloody blackferret or something by now, gnawing on pine cones. But it was likely a blackferret that wanted to live back in the Two Rivers.</p>
<p class="para">No, Mat did not want to go back. There was no Tuon back in the Two Rivers. Light, well, he would have to figure out what to do with Tuon. But he did not want to be rid of her. If she were still with him, he would let her call him Toy without complaining. Well, not much anyway.</p>
<p class="para">Moiraine first. He wished he knew more about the Aelfinn and Eelfinn and their bloody tower. Nobody knew about it, nobody spoke more than legends, nobody had anything useful to say….</p>
<p class="para">…nobody but Birgitte. Mat stopped in the street. Birgitte. <span class="italic1">She</span> had been the one to tell Olver how to get into the Tower. How had she known?</p>
<p class="para">Cursing himself for a fool, he turned toward the Inner City. The streets were emptying of the traffic that had burdened them before the almost-rain began. Soon Mat felt he had the whole city to himself; even the cutpurses and beggars withdrew.</p>
<p class="para">For some reason, that put him on edge more than being stared at. It was not natural. Someone should have tried at least to bloody shadow him to see if he was worth picking off. Once again, he longed for his medallion. He had been an idiot to give that away. Better to have cut off his own bloody hand and offered that to Elayne as payment! Was the <span class="italic1">gholam</span> there, in that darkness, somewhere?</p>
<p class="para">There should have been toughs on the street. Cities were full of them. That was practically one of the bloody requirements for a city. A town hall, a few inns and a tavern, and several blunt-faced fellows whose only desire was to pound you into the mud and spend your coin on drink and women.</p>
<p class="para">He passed a courtyard and headed through the Mason’s Gate into the Inner City, the white archway almost seeming to glow, rain-slick in the phantom light of the clouded moon. Mat’s quarterstaff knocked against the paving stones. The gate guards were huddled and quiet in their cloaks. Like statues, not men at all. The entire place felt like a tomb.</p>
<p class="para">A ways past the gate, he passed an alleyway, and hesitated. He thought he could see a group of shadowy forms inside. Tall buildings rose on either side, grand Ogier masonry. A grunt sounded from inside the alleyway.</p>
<p class="para">“A robbery?” Mat said with relief.</p>
<p class="para">A hulking figure looked back out of the alleyway. Moonlight revealed a fellow with dark eyes and a long cloak. He seemed stunned to find Mat standing there. He pointed with a thick-fingered hand, and three of his companions made for Mat.</p>
<p class="para">Mat relaxed, wiping his brow free of rainwater. So there <span class="italic1">were</span> footpads out this night. What a relief. He had been jumping at nothing!</p>
<p class="para">A thug swung his cudgel at Mat. Mat had worn the shortsword on the right side intentionally; the thug took the bait, assuming that Mat would move to draw the weapon.</p>
<p class="para">Instead, Mat brought up the quarterstaff swiftly, snapping the butt against the man’s leg. The footpad stumbled, and Mat swung into the man’s head. The drizzle, which was nearly a proper rain by now, sprayed off the cutpurse as he fell, tripping one of his companions.</p>
<p class="para">Mat stepped back and slammed the top of the quarterstaff down on the head of the tripping thug. He went down on top of his companion. The third man looked back toward his leader, who held to the collar of a gangly man Mat could barely make out in the shadows. Mat took the opportunity to leap over the small pile of unconscious thugs, swinging at the third man.</p>
<p class="para">The footpad brought his cudgel up to protect his head, so Mat slammed his quarterstaff into the man’s foot. He then swung the quarterstaff, knocking aside the third man’s weak parry, and dropped him with a blow to the face.</p>
<p class="para">Mat casually flipped a knife toward the leader of the gang, who was charging forward. The leader gurgled, stumbled in the drizzle, clawing at the knife in his neck. The others Mat would leave unconscious—poor fools, maybe they would take this warning and reform.</p>
<p class="para">Mat stepped to the side as the leader stumbled past, then finally collapsed on top of his three companions. Mat kicked him over, pulled out the knife, then cleaned it. Finally, he glanced at the victim of the robbery.</p>
<p class="para">“Sure am glad to see you,” Mat said.</p>
<p class="para">“You…you are?” the man asked.</p>
<p class="para">“Sure am,” Mat said, standing up straight. “I thought the thieves were not out tonight. A city without cutpurses, well, that’s like a field without weeds. And if there were no weeds, what would you need a farmer for? Bloody inhospitable, I tell you.”</p>
<p class="para">The rescued man stumbled forward on shaky feet. He seemed confused by what Mat had said, but he scrambled up, taking Mat’s hand. “Thank you!” The man had a nasal voice. “Thank you so, so much.” In the faint moonlight, Mat could barely make out a wide face with buck teeth atop an awkwardly thin body.</p>
<p class="para">Mat shrugged, setting aside his staff and unwinding his scarf—which was getting sodden—and beginning to wring it free. “I’d stay away from traveling by yourself at night, if I were you, friend.”</p>
<p class="para">The man squinted in the darkness. “You!” he said, voice nearly a squeak.</p>
<p class="para">Mat groaned. “Blood and bloody ashes! Can’t I go <span class="italic1">anywhere</span> without—”</p>
<p class="para">He cut off as the man lunged, a dagger flashing in the faint moonlight. Mat cursed, and snapped his scarf in front of him. The dagger hit the cloth instead of Mat’s gut, and Mat quickly twisted his hands, tying the assassin’s dagger in lengths of cloth.</p>
<p class="para">The man yelped, and Mat released the scarf and pulled out a pair of knives, one in each hand, releasing them by reflex. They took the assassin in the eyes. One in each eye. Light! Mat had not been aiming for the eyes.</p>
<p class="para">The man collapsed to the wet paving stones.</p>
<p class="para">Mat stood breathing in and out. “Mother’s milk in a cup! Mother’s <span class="italic1">bloody</span> milk!” He grabbed his quarterstaff, glancing about him, but the gloomy street was empty. “I rescued you. I rescued you, and you try to stab me?”</p>
<p class="para">Mat knelt down beside the corpse. Then, grimly certain what he would find, he fished in the man’s pouch. He came out with a couple of coins—gold coins—and a folded-up piece of paper. Moonlight revealed Mat’s face on it. He crinkled the paper and shoved it in his pocket.</p>
<p class="para">One in each bloody eye. Better than the man deserved. Mat retied his scarf, grabbed his knives, then walked out onto the street, wishing he had left the assassin to his fate.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Birgitte folded her arms, leaning against a marble pillar and watching as Elayne sat enjoying an evening presentation of “players.” Groups like this—acting out stories—had become very popular in Cairhien, and were now trying to achieve the same success in Andor. One of the palace halls, where bards performed, had been adapted to allow the players to act out their stories.</p>
<p class="para">Birgitte shook her head. What was the good of acting out fake stories? Why not go <span class="italic1">live</span> a few stories of your own? Besides, she’d prefer a bard any day. Hopefully this fashion of seeing “players” would die quickly.</p>
<p class="para">This particular story was a retelling of the tragic marriage and death of the Princess Walishen, slain by beasts of the Shadow. Birgitte was familiar with the ballad that the players had adapted to form their story. In fact, they sang parts of it during the performance. It was remarkable how little that song had changed over the years. Some different names, a few different notes, but the same overall.</p>
<p class="para">Much like her own lives. Repeated over and over, but with little variations. Sometimes she was a soldier. Sometimes she was a forest woman, with no formal military training. She’d been a general once or twice, unfortunately. She’d rather leave that particular job for someone else.</p>
<p class="para">She’d been a guard, a noble thief, a lady, a peasant, a killer and a savior. But she had never before been a Warder. The unfamiliarity didn’t bother her; in most of her lives, she had no knowledge of what had come before. What she could draw from her previous lives now was a boon, yes, but she had no right to those memories.</p>
<p class="para">That didn’t stop her heart from twisting each time one of those memories faded. Light! If she couldn’t <span class="italic1">be</span> with Gaidal this time around, couldn’t she at least <span class="italic1">remember</span> him? It was as if the Pattern didn’t know what to do with her. She’d been forced into this life, shoving other threads aside, taking an unexpected place. The Pattern was trying to weave her in. What would happen when all of the memories faded? Would she remember waking up as an adult with no history? The thought terrified her as no battlefield ever had.</p>
<p class="para">She nodded to one of her Guardswomen, Kaila Bent, who passed by the back row of the makeshift theater and saluted.</p>
<p class="para">“Well?” Birgitte asked, stepping around the corner to speak with Kaila.</p>
<p class="para">“Nothing to report,” Kaila said. “All is well.” She was a lanky firehaired woman, and had taken very easily to wearing the trousers and coat of a Guardswoman. “Or, all is as well as it could be while having to suffer through <span class="italic1">The Death of Princess Walishen</span>.”</p>
<p class="para">“Stop complaining,” Birgitte said, suppressing a wince as the diva—so the players called her—began a particularly shrill aria—so they called a song by yourself. Why did the players need so many new names for things? “You could be out patrolling in the rain.”</p>
<p class="para">“I could?” Kaila asked, sounding eager. “Why didn’t you say so sooner? Maybe I’ll get struck by lightning. That might be preferable.”</p>
<p class="para">Birgitte snorted. “Get back to your rounds.”</p>
<p class="para">Kaila saluted and left. Birgitte tuned back into the theater, leaning against the pillar. Perhaps she should have brought some wax to stuff in her ears. She glanced over at Elayne. The Queen sat with a calm demeanor, watching the play. At times, Birgitte felt more like a nursemaid than a bodyguard. How did you protect a woman who seemed, at times, so determined to see herself dead?</p>
<p class="para">And yet, Elayne was also so very capable. Like tonight; she’d somehow convinced her most bitter rival to attend this play. That was Ellorien sitting over in the eastern row; the woman’s last parting from the palace had been so bitter that Birgitte hadn’t expected her to return unless she was in chains. Yet here she was. It whispered of a political maneuver by Elayne that was thirteen steps more subtle than Birgitte had a mind for.</p>
<p class="para">She shook her head. Elayne <span class="italic1">was</span> a queen. Volatility and all. She’d be good for Andor. Assuming Birgitte could keep that golden-haired head from being lopped off its neck.</p>
<p class="para">After some time suffering through the singing, Kaila approached again. Birgitte stood up straight, curious at the woman’s quick pace. “What?” she asked quietly.</p>
<p class="para">“You looked bored,” Kaila whispered, “so I thought I’d bring this to you. Disturbance at the Plum Gate.” That was the southeastern entrance to the palace grounds. “Someone tried to sneak through.”</p>
<p class="para">“Another beggar looking for scraps? Or a spy for one of the lordlings, hoping to listen in?”</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t know,” Kaila said. “I heard the news thirdhand from Calison as we passed on patrol. He said the Guardsmen have the intruder in custody at the gate.”</p>
<p class="para">Birgitte glanced to the side. It looked like another solo was about to begin. “You have command here; hold this post and take reports. I’ll go stretch my legs and check on this disturbance.”</p>
<p class="para">“Bring me some wax for my ears when you come back, would you?”</p>
<p class="para">Birgitte chuckled, leaving the theater and stepping into a white-and-red palace hallway. Though she had Guardswomen and men with extra bows at the hallways, Birgitte herself carried a sword, for an assassination attempt would most likely turn to close-quarters fighting.</p>
<p class="para">Birgitte trotted down the hallway, glancing out a window when she passed. The sky leaked a strengthening drizzle. Utterly dreary. Gaidal would have liked this weather. He loved the rain. On occasion, she’d joked that drizzle suited his face better, making him less likely to frighten children. Light, but she missed that man.</p>
<p class="para">The most direct route to the Plum Gate took her through the servants’ quarters. In many palaces, this would have meant entering a section of the building that was more drab, meant for less important people. But this building had been Ogier built, and they had particular views about such things. The marble stonework here was as grand as it was elsewhere, with tiled mosaics of red and white.</p>
<p class="para">The rooms, while small by royal standards, were each large enough to hold an entire family. Birgitte generally preferred to take her meals in the servants’ large, open dining hall. Four separate hearths crackled here in defiance of the dreary night, and off-duty servants and Guards laughed and chatted. Some said you could judge a monarch by the way he treated those who served him. If that were the case, then the Andoran palace had been designed in a way to encourage the best in its queens.</p>
<p class="para">Birgitte reluctantly passed by the inviting scents of food, and instead pushed her way out into the cold summer storm. The chill wasn’t biting. Just uncomfortable. She pulled up the hood of her cloak and crossed the slick paving down to the Plum Gate. The gatehouse was alight with an orange glow, and the Guardsmen on watch stood outside in wet cloaks, halberds held to the side.</p>
<p class="para">Birgitte marched up to the gatehouse, water dripping from the lip of her hood, then pounded on the thick oak door. It opened, revealing the bald-headed, mustached face of Renald Macer, sergeant on duty. A stout man, he had wide hands and a calm temperament. She always thought he should be in a shop somewhere making shoes, but the Guard took all types, and dependability was often more important than skill with the sword.</p>
<p class="para">“Captain-General!” he exclaimed. “What are you doing here?”</p>
<p class="para">“Getting rained on,” she snapped.</p>
<p class="para">“Oh, my!” He stepped back, making way for her to enter the gatehouse. It had a single crowded room. The soldiers were on storm shift—meaning twice as many men would work the gate as usual, but they would only have to stand outside an hour before rotating with the men warming inside the gatehouse.</p>
<p class="para">Three Guardsmen sat at a table, throwing dice into a dicing box while an open-fronted iron stove consumed logs and warmed tea. Dicing with the four soldiers was a wiry man with a black scarf wrapped around the bottom of his face. His clothing was scruffy, his head topped by a mop of wet brown hair sticking out in all directions. Brown eyes glanced at Birgitte over the top of the scarf, and the man sank down a little in his seat.</p>
<p class="para">Birgitte took off her cloak and shook it free of rainwater. “This is your intruder, I assume?”</p>
<p class="para">“Why, yes,” the sergeant said. “How did you hear about that?”</p>
<p class="para">She eyed the intruder. “He tried to sneak onto the palace grounds, and now you’re <span class="italic1">dicing</span> with him?”</p>
<p class="para">The sergeant and the other men looked sheepish. “Well, my Lady—”</p>
<p class="para">“I’m no lady.” <span class="italic1">Not this time at least.</span> “I work for a living.”</p>
<p class="para">“Er, yes,” Macer continued. “Well, he gave up his sword readily, and he doesn’t <span class="italic1">seem</span> that dangerous. Just another beggar wanting scraps from the kitchens. Right nice fellow. Thought we’d get him warm before sending him out into that weather again.”</p>
<p class="para">“A beggar,” she said. “With a sword?”</p>
<p class="para">Sergeant Macer scratched his head. “I guess that <span class="italic1">is</span> kind of odd.”</p>
<p class="para">“You could charm the helmet off a general on a battlefield, couldn’t you, Mat?” she said.</p>
<p class="para">“Mat?” the man asked in a familiar voice. “I don’t know what you mean, my good woman. My name is Garard, a simple beggar who has a quite interesting past, if you care to listen to it—”</p>
<p class="para">She eyed him with a firm gaze.</p>
<p class="para">“Oh, bloody ashes, Birgitte,” he complained, taking off the scarf. “I only wanted to get warm for a spell.”</p>
<p class="para">“And win the coin off my men.”</p>
<p class="para">“A friendly game never hurt a man,” Mat said.</p>
<p class="para">“Unless it was against you. Look, why are you <span class="italic1">sneaking</span> into the palace?”</p>
<p class="para">“It took too much bloody work to get in last time,” Mat said, sitting back in his chair. “Thought I might pass that up this time.”</p>
<p class="para">Sergeant Macer glanced at Birgitte. “You know this man?”</p>
<p class="para">“Unfortunately,” she said. “You can release him to my custody, Sergeant. I’ll see that Master Cauthon is properly taken care of.”</p>
<p class="para">“Master Cauthon?” one of the men said. “You mean the Raven Prince?”</p>
<p class="para">“Oh, for bloody…” Mat said, as he stood and picked up his walking staff. “Thanks,” he said dryly to Birgitte, throwing on his coat.</p>
<p class="para">She put her cloak back on, then pushed open the door as one of the Guards handed Mat his sword, belt still attached. Since when had Mat carried a shortsword? Probably a decoy away from the quarterstaff.</p>
<p class="para">The two stepped out into the rain as Mat tied on the belt. “Raven Prince?” she asked.</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t want to talk about it.”</p>
<p class="para">“Why not?”</p>
<p class="para">“Because I’m getting too bloody famous for my own good, that’s why.”</p>
<p class="para">“Wait until it tracks you across generations,” she said, glancing up at the sky, blinking as a raindrop hit her square in the eye.</p>
<p class="para">“Come on, let’s go grab a drink,” Mat said, walking toward the gate.</p>
<p class="para">“Wait,” she said. “Don’t you want to go see Elayne?”</p>
<p class="para">“Elayne?” Mat said. “Blood and ashes, Birgitte, I’m here to talk to <span class="italic1">you</span>. Why do you think I let those Guards catch me? You want a drink or not?”</p>
<p class="para">She hesitated, then shrugged. By putting Kaila on duty in her place, Birgitte had officially gone on break. She knew a fairly decent tavern only two streets from the Palace.</p>
<p class="para">“All right,” she said, waving to the Guards and leading Mat onto the rainy street. “But I’ll need to have milk or tea instead of ale. We aren’t sure if her Warder drinking would be bad for the babies or not.” She smiled, thinking of a drunk Elayne trying to talk to her allies after the play. “Though if I make her tipsy, it might be good revenge for some of the things she’s done to me.”</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t know why you let her bond you in the first place,” Mat said. The street was nearly empty around them, though the tavern up ahead looked inviting, its yellow light spilling into the street.</p>
<p class="para">“I didn’t have a say in the matter,” she said. “But I don’t regret it. Did you really sneak into the palace to meet with me?”</p>
<p class="para">Mat shrugged. “I have some questions.”</p>
<p class="para">“About what?”</p>
<p class="para">He replaced that ridiculous scarf, which she noticed had a rip in the middle. “You know,” he said. “<span class="italic1">Things</span>.”</p>
<p class="para">Mat was one of the few who knew who she really was. He couldn’t mean…. “No,” she said, turning, “I don’t want to talk about it.”</p>
<p class="para">“Bloody ashes, Birgitte! I <span class="italic1">need</span> your information. Come on, for an old friend.”</p>
<p class="para">“We agreed to keep each other’s secrets.”</p>
<p class="para">“And I’m not out blabbing yours,” Mat said quickly. “But, see, there’s this issue.”</p>
<p class="para">“What issue?”</p>
<p class="para">“The Tower of Ghenjei.”</p>
<p class="para">“That’s not an issue,” she said. “You stay away from it.”</p>
<p class="para">“I can’t.”</p>
<p class="para">“Of course you can. It’s a flaming <span class="italic1">building,</span> Mat. It can’t exactly chase you down.”</p>
<p class="para">“Very amusing. Look, will you at least hear me out, over a mug? Of, er, milk. I’ll buy.”</p>
<p class="para">She stopped for a moment. Then she sighed. “Bloody right, you’ll buy,” she muttered, waving him onward. They entered the inn, known as The Grand Hike, which was crowded beyond usual because of the rain. The innkeeper was a friend of Birgitte’s, however, and he had the bouncer toss out a drunkard sleeping in one of the booths to make room for her.</p>
<p class="para">She tossed him a coin in thanks, and he nodded his ugly head to her—he was missing several teeth, one eye, and most of his hair. Best-looking man in the place. Birgitte held up two fingers to order drinks—he knew that she took milk these days—and she waved Mat to the booth.</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t rightly think I’ve ever seen an uglier man than that innkeeper,” Mat said as they sat.</p>
<p class="para">“You haven’t been alive long enough,” she said, leaning back against the wall and putting her booted feet up on the table. There was just room enough for her to do so, sitting on the bench of the booth lengthwise. “If Old Snert were a few years younger, and if someone thought to break his nose in a few places, I might consider him. He’s got a fine chest, nice and full of curly hair to get your fingers in.”</p>
<p class="para">Mat grinned. “Have I ever mentioned how odd it is to go drinking with a woman who talks about men like that?”</p>
<p class="para">She shrugged. “Ghenjei. Why in the name of Normad’s Ears are you wanting to go there?”</p>
<p class="para">“Whose ears?” Mat asked.</p>
<p class="para">“Answer me.”</p>
<p class="para">Mat sighed, then absently accepted his mug as the serving girl delivered it. Uncharacteristically, he didn’t slap her backside, though he did give her a good leer as she walked away. “The bloody snakes and foxes have a friend of mine,” he said, lowering his scarf and taking a pull on his drink.</p>
<p class="para">“Leave him. You can’t save him, Mat. If he was foolish enough to go into their realm, he deserves what he got.”</p>
<p class="para">“It’s a woman,” Mat said.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Ah.</span> Birgitte thought. Bloody fool. Heroic, but still a fool.</p>
<p class="para">“I can’t leave her,” Mat continued. “I owe her. Besides, a good friend of mine is going in whether I want him to or not. I <span class="italic1">have</span> to help.”</p>
<p class="para">“Then they’ll have all three of you,” Birgitte said. “Look, if you go in through the portals, then you’re locked into the treaties. They protect you to an extent, but they also restrict you. You’ll never get anywhere useful after entering by one of the doorframes.”</p>
<p class="para">“And if you go in the other way?” Mat asked. “You told Olver how to open the Tower.”</p>
<p class="para">“Because I was telling him a bedtime story! Light, I never thought one of you sap-for-brains would actually <span class="italic1">try</span> to get in!”</p>
<p class="para">“But if we go in that way, can we find her?”</p>
<p class="para">“Maybe,” Birgitte said, “but you won’t. The treaties won’t be in effect, so the Aelfinn and Eelfinn can draw blood. Normally, you only have to worry about tricks with pits or ropes, since they can’t….” She trailed off, glancing at him. “How <span class="italic1">did</span> you get hanged, anyway?”</p>
<p class="para">He flushed, looking down into his drink. “They should post a flaming explanation on those doorframes. ‘Step through here and they can bloody hang you. And they will. Idiot.’ ”</p>
<p class="para">Birgitte snorted. They’d talked about the memories he had. She should have put it together. “If you go in the other way, they’ll probably try that as well. Shedding blood in their kingdom can have strange effects. They’ll try to break your bones with a fall or drug you to sleep. And they <span class="italic1">will</span> win, Mat. It’s their world.”</p>
<p class="para">“And if we cheat?” Mat asked. “Iron, music, fire.”</p>
<p class="para">“That’s not cheating. That’s being smart. <span class="italic1">Everyone</span> with half a wit who enters through the tower carries those things. But only one out of a thousand makes it back out, Mat.”</p>
<p class="para">He hesitated, then fished a small handful of coins out of his pocket. “What do you think the odds are that if I toss these into the air, they will all come up heads? One in a thousand?”</p>
<p class="para">“Mat…”</p>
<p class="para">He tossed them above the table. They came down in a spray, hitting the tabletop. Not a single one of them bounced or rolled from the table onto the floor.</p>
<p class="para">Mat didn’t look down at the coins. He met her eyes as they all rolled and vibrated to a stop. She glanced at them. Two dozen coins. Each had landed face up.</p>
<p class="para">“One in a thousand is good odds,” he said. “For me.”</p>
<p class="para">“Bloody ashes. You’re as bad as Elayne! Don’t you see? All it takes is one wrong throw. Even you miss once in a while.”</p>
<p class="para">“I’ll take the chance. Burn me, Birgitte, I know it’s stupid, but I’m doing it. How do you know so much about the Tower anyway? You’ve been into it, haven’t you?”</p>
<p class="para">“I have,” she admitted.</p>
<p class="para">Mat looked smug. “Well <span class="italic1">you</span> got back out! How’d you manage it?”</p>
<p class="para">She hesitated, then finally took up her mug of milk. “That legend didn’t survive, I’m assuming?”</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t know it,” Mat said.</p>
<p class="para">“I went in to ask them to save the life of my love,” she said. “It came after the battle of Lahpoint Hills, where we led the Buchaner rebellion. Gaidal was wounded horribly; a blow to the head that made him unable to think straight. He forgot who I was, some of the time. It tore my heart, so I took him to the Tower to be Healed.”</p>
<p class="para">“And how’d you get out?” Mat asked. “How’d you fool them?”</p>
<p class="para">“I didn’t,” Birgitte said softly.</p>
<p class="para">Mat froze.</p>
<p class="para">“The Eelfinn never Healed him,” she continued. “They killed us both. I didn’t survive, Mat. That is the end of that particular legend.”</p>
<p class="para">He fell silent. “Oh,” he finally said. “Well, that’s kind of a sad story, then.”</p>
<p class="para">“They can’t all end in victory. Gaidal and I don’t deal well with happy endings anyway. Better for us to burn out in glory.” She grimaced, remembering one incarnation when she and he had been forced to grow old together, peacefully. Most boring life she’d ever known, though at the time—ignorant of her grander part in the Pattern—she’d been happy with it.</p>
<p class="para">“Well I’m still going,” Mat said.</p>
<p class="para">She sighed. “I can’t go with you, Mat. Not and leave Elayne. She has a death wish the size of your pride, and I mean to see she survives.”</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t expect you to go,” Mat said quickly. “Burn me, that’s not what I’m asking. And…” He frowned. “A death what the size of my <span class="italic1">what</span>?”</p>
<p class="para">“Never mind,” she said, drinking her milk. She had a soft spot for milk, though she didn’t tell people of it. Of course, she’d be happy when she could drink again; she missed Old Snert’s yeasty drinks. She liked ugly beer as much as she liked ugly men.</p>
<p class="para">“I came to you because I need help,” Mat said.</p>
<p class="para">“What more is there to say? You’re taking iron, fire, and music. Iron will hurt them, ward them, and hold them. Fire will scare them and kill them. Music will entrance them. But you’ll find that both fire and music grow less and less effective the longer you use them.</p>
<p class="para">“The tower isn’t a place, it’s a portal. A kind of gate to the crossroads between their realms. You’ll find both of them there, Aelfinn snakes and Eelfinn foxes. Assuming they’re working together currently. They have a strange relationship.”</p>
<p class="para">“But what do they <span class="italic1">want</span>?” Mat asked. “From us, I mean. Why do they care?”</p>
<p class="para">“Emotion,” Birgitte said. “That’s why they built portals into our world, that’s why they entice us in. They feed off what we feel. They like Aes Sedai in particular, for some reason. Perhaps those with the One Power taste like a strong ale.”</p>
<p class="para">Mat shivered visibly.</p>
<p class="para">“The inside will be confusing,” Birgitte said. “Getting anywhere specific in there is difficult. Going in through the tower instead of the doorframes put me in danger, but I knew that if I could reach that grand hall, I’d be able to make a deal. You don’t get anything free if you go in the tower, by the way. They’ll ask for something, something dear to you.</p>
<p class="para">“Anyway, I figured out a method to find the grand hall. Iron dust, left behind me in the intersections where I’d passed so that I knew which ways I’d gone before. They couldn’t touch it, you see, and…are you sure you’ve never heard this story?”</p>
<p class="para">Mat shook his head.</p>
<p class="para">“It used to be popular around these parts,” she said, frowning. “A hundred years ago or so.”</p>
<p class="para">“You sound offended.”</p>
<p class="para">“It was a good story,” she said.</p>
<p class="para">“If I survive, I’ll have Thom compose a bloody ballad about it, Birgitte. Tell me about the dust. Did your plan work?”</p>
<p class="para">She shook her head. “I still got lost. I don’t know if they blew away the dust somehow, or if the place is so huge that I never repeated myself. I ended up cornered, my fire going out, my lyre broken, my bowstring snapped, Gaidal unconscious behind me. He could walk some of the days in there, but was too dizzy on others, so I pulled him on the litter I’d brought.”</p>
<p class="para">“Some of the <span class="italic1">days</span>?” Mat said. “How long were you in there?”</p>
<p class="para">“I had provisions for two months,” Birgitte said, grimacing. “Don’t know how long we lasted after those ran out.”</p>
<p class="para">“Bloody ashes!” Mat said, then took a long swig of his ale.</p>
<p class="para">“I told you not to go in,” Birgitte said. “Assuming you do reach your friend, you’ll never get back out. You can wander for weeks in that place and never turn right or left, keep going straight, passing hallway after hallway. All the same. The grand hall could be minutes away, if you knew which direction to take. But you’ll keep missing it.”</p>
<p class="para">Mat stared into his mug, perhaps wishing he’d ordered something more potent.</p>
<p class="para">“You reconsidering?” she asked.</p>
<p class="para">“No,” he said. “But when we get out, Moiraine better bloody appreciate this! <span class="italic1">Two months</span>?” He frowned. “Wait. If you both died in there, how did the story get out?”</p>
<p class="para">She shrugged. “Never did find out. Perhaps one of the Aes Sedai used their questions to ask. Everyone knew I’d gone in. I was called Jethari Moondancer then. You’re <span class="italic1">sure</span> you’ve never heard the story?”</p>
<p class="para">He shook his head again.</p>
<p class="para">She sighed, settling back. Well, not <span class="italic1">every</span> one of the tales about her could live on forever, but she’d thought that one would stand for a few more generations.</p>
<p class="para">She raised her mug to drink the last of her milk. The mug never got there. She froze when she felt a jolt of emotion from Elayne. Anger, fury, <span class="italic1">pain</span>.</p>
<p class="para">Birgitte slammed the mug down on the table, then threw coins down and stood up, cursing.</p>
<p class="para">“What?” Mat said, on his feet in an eyeblink.</p>
<p class="para">“Elayne. In trouble. <span class="italic1">Again</span>. She’s hurt.”</p>
<p class="para">“Bloody ashes,” Mat snapped, grabbing his coat and staff as they ran for the exit.</p>
