<div class="subtitle-chapter"><span class="calibre2"><span class="calibre18">Assurances</span></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">I</span>n a few minutes Ihvon returned. “You can go ahead, Mistress al’Vere” was all he said before he and Tomas both vanished into the brush again without so much as the rustle of a leaf.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“They are very good,” Gaul muttered, still staring around suspiciously. “A child could hide in this,” Chiad told him, slapping a redberry branch. But she watched the undergrowth as closely as Gaul did.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">None of the Aiel appeared eager to go on. Not reluctant, precisely, and certainly not afraid, but definitely not eager. One day Perrin hoped to figure out what it was Aiel did feel toward Aes Sedai. One day. He was not particularly enthusiastic himself, today.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Let’s go meet these Aes Sedai of yours,” he told Mistress al’Vere gruffly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The old sickhouse was even more ramshackle than he remembered, a sprawling single story that leaned drunkenly, half the rooms open to the sky, a forty-foot sourgum tree poking up from one. The forest closed in on every side. A thick net of vines and briars snaked up the walls, covered the remaining thatch with green; he thought they might be all that was holding the building up. The front door was cleared, though. He smelled horses, and a faint aroma of beans and ham, but oddly, no woodsmoke.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Tying their animals to low branches, they followed Mistress al’Vere inside, where vine-shrouded windows admitted only a dim light. The front
room was large and bare of furnishings, with dirt in the corners and a few cobwebs that had escaped an obviously hasty cleaning. Four blanket rolls were laid out on the floor, with saddles and saddlebags and neatly tied bundles against the wall, and a small kettle on the stone hearth gave off the cooking smells despite the lack of any fire. A smaller kettle seemed to be water for tea, almost at the boil. Two Aes Sedai awaited them. Marin al’Vere curtsied hastily and launched into an anxious cascade of introductions and explanations.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin leaned his chin against his bow. He recognized the Aes Sedai. Verin Mathwin, plump and square-faced, gray streaking her brown hair despite her smooth-cheeked Aes Sedai agelessness, was Brown Ajah, and like all Browns seemingly lost half the time in the search for knowledge, whether old and lost or new. But sometimes her dark eyes belied that vague dreamy expression, as now, looking past Marin at him sharp as tacks. She was one of two Aes Sedai besides Moiraine he was certain knew about Rand, and he suspected she knew more about himself than she let on. Her eyes took on that slight vagueness again as she listened to Marin, but for an instant they had weighed him on scales, factored him into her own plans. He would have to be very careful around her.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The other, a dark, slender woman in a deep green silk riding dress that contrasted sharply with Verin’s plain brown, ink-stained at the cuffs, he had never met, and only seen once. Alanna Mosvani was Green Ajah, if he remembered correctly, a beautiful woman with long black hair and penetrating dark eyes. Those eyes sought him, too, while she listened to Marin. Something Egwene had said came back to him. <span class="calibre18">Some Aes Sedai who shouldn’t know about Rand show too much interest in him. Elaida, for instance, and Alanna Mosvani. I don’t think I trust either of them.</span> Perhaps it would be best to be guided by Egwene until he found out differently.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">His ears perked up when Marin said, still apprehensive, “You were asking about him, Verin Sedai. Perrin, I mean. All three boys, but Perrin among them. It seemed the easiest way to keep him from getting himself killed was to bring him to you. There just wasn’t any time to ask first. Do say you under—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It is quite all right, Mistress al’Vere,” Verin interrupted in a soothing tone. “You did exactly the correct thing. Perrin is in the right hands, now. Also I will enjoy the chance to learn more about the Aiel, and it is always a pleasure to talk with an Ogier. I will pick your brain, Loial. I have found some fascinating things in Ogier books.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Loial gave her a pleased smile; anything to do with books seemed to please him. Gaul, on the other hand, exchanged guarded looks with Bain and Chiad.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It is all right as long as you do not do it again,” Alanna said firmly. “Unless . . . . You are alone?” she asked Perrin in a voice that required an answer, and right now. “Did the other two return as well?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Why are you here?” he demanded right back.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Perrin!” Mistress al’Vere said sharply. “Mind your manners! You may have picked up some rough ways out in the world, but you can just lose them again now that you are home.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Do not trouble yourself,” Verin told her. “Perrin and I are old friends now. I understand him.” Her dark eyes glittered at him for a moment.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We will take care of him.” Alanna’s cool words seemed open to interpretation.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Verin smiled and patted Marin’s shoulder. “You had better go on back to the village. We don’t want anyone wondering why you are walking in the woods.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Mistress al’Vere nodded. Pausing by Perrin, she put a hand on his arm. “You know you have my sympathy,” she said gently. “Just remember that getting yourself killed won’t help anything. Do what the Aes Sedai tell you.” He mumbled something noncommittal, but it seemed to satisfy her.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">When Mistress al’Vere had gone, Verin said, “You have our sympathy as well, Perrin. If there was anything we could have done, we would have.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He did not want to think of his family now. “You still haven’t answered my question.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Perrin!” Faile managed to copy Mistress al’Vere’s tone almost exactly, but he paid it no mind.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Why are you here? It seems awfully coincidental. Whitecloaks and Trollocs, and the two of you just happen to be here at the same time.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Not coincidental at all,” Verin replied. “Ah, the tea water is ready.” The water subsided from a boil as she began to bustle about, tossing a handful of leaves into the kettle, directing Faile to find metal cups in one of the bundles against the wall. Alanna, with her arms folded beneath her breasts, never took her eyes off Perrin, their heat conflicting with the coolness of her face. “Year by year,” Verin continued, “we find fewer and fewer girls who can be taught to channel. Sheriam believes we may have spent the last three thousand years culling the ability out of humankind by gentling every man who can channel we find. The proof of it, she says, is how
very few men we do find. Why, even a hundred years ago the records say there were two or three a year, and five hundred years—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Alanna harrumphed. “What else can we do, Verin? Let them go insane? Follow the Whites’ mad plan?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I think not,” Verin replied calmly. “Even if we could find women willing to bear children by gentled men, there is no guarantee the children would be able to channel, or would be girls. I did suggest that if they wanted to increase the stock, Aes Sedai should be the ones to have the children; themselves, in fact, since they put it forward in the first place. Alvia-rin was not amused.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“She would not be,” Alanna laughed. The sudden flash of delight, breaking her fiery, dark-eyed stare, was startling. “I wish I could have seen her face.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Her expression was . . . interesting,” the Brown sister said musingly. “Calm yourself, Perrin. I will give you the rest of your answer. Tea?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Trying to wipe the glare from his face, somehow he found himself seated on the floor; his bow beside him and a metal cup full of strong tea in his hand. Everyone sat in a circle in the middle of the room. Alanna took up the explanation of their presence, perhaps to forestall the other Aes Sedai’s tendency to ramble.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Here in the Two Rivers, where I suspect no Aes Sedai had visited in a thousand years, Moiraine found two women who could not only be taught to channel, but who had the ability born in them, and heard of another who had died because she could not teach herself.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Not to mention three <span class="calibre18">ta’veren,</span>” Verin murmured into her tea.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Do you have any idea,” Alanna went on, “how many towns and villages we usually must visit to find three girls with the ability inborn? The only wonder is that it took us so long to come hunting more. The old blood is very strong here in the Two Rivers. We were only in Watch Hill a week before the Children appeared, and were very careful not to reveal who we were to any but the Women’s Circle there, yet even so we found four girls who can be trained, and one child I think has the ability inborn.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It was difficult to be sure,” Verin added. “She is only twelve. None have anywhere near the potential of Egwene or Nynaeve, but the number is still nothing less than remarkable. There might be another two or three just around Watch Hill. We have had no chance to examine girls here, or farther south. Taren Ferry was a disappointment, I must say. Too much interchange of bloodlines with the outside, I suppose.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin had to admit it made sense. But it did not answer all his questions, or settle all his doubts. He shifted, stretching out his leg. The spear wound in his thigh hurt. “I don’t understand why you are hiding here. Whitecloaks arresting innocent people, and here you sit. Trollocs running all over the Two Rivers apparently, and here you sit.” Loial muttered under his breath, a muted rumble. Perrin caught “angering Aes Sedai” and “hornet’s nest,” but he continued to hammer at them. “Why aren’t you doing something? You’re Aes Sedai! Burn me, why aren’t you doing something?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Perrin!” Faile hissed before turning an apologetic smile to Verin and Alanna. “Please forgive him. Moiraine Sedai spoiled him. She has an easy manner, I suppose, and she let him get away with things. Please don’t be angry with him. He will do better.” She shot him a sharp look, indicating she meant that for his ears as much as theirs, or more. He gave her a piece of his glower. She had no right interfering in this.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“An easy manner?” Verin said, blinking. “Moiraine? I never noticed.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Alanna waved Faile to silence. “You certainly do not understand,” the Aes Sedai told Perrin in a tight voice. “You do not understand the restrictions under which we labor. The Three Oaths are not merely words. I brought two Warders with me to this place.” The Greens were the only Ajah to bond more than a single Warder apiece; a few, he had heard, even had three or four. “The Children caught Owein crossing an open field. I felt every arrow that struck him until he died. I felt him die. Had I been there, I could have defended him, and myself, with the Power. But I cannot use it for revenge. The Oaths do not permit it. The Children are very nearly as vile as men can be, short of Darkfriends, but they are not Darkfriends, and for that reason they are safe from the Power except in self-defense. Stretch that as far as we can, it will only stretch so far.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“As for Trollocs,” Verin added, “we have done for a number of them, and two Myrddraal, but there are limits. Halfmen can sense channeling, after a fashion. If we manage to draw a hundred Trollocs down on ourselves, there is very little we can do except run.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin scratched at his beard. He should have expected this, should have known. He had seen Moiraine face Trollocs, and he had some idea of what she could do and what not. He realized he had been thinking of how Rand had killed all the Trollocs in the Stone, only Rand was stronger than either of these Aes Sedai, probably stronger than both together. Well, whether they helped him or not, he still meant to finish every Trolloc in
the Two Rivers. After he rescued Mat’s family, and the Luhhans. If he thought about it carefully enough, he had to find a way. His thigh ached miserably.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You are injured.” Setting her cup on the floor, Alanna came across to kneel beside him and take his head in her hands. A tingle ran through him. “Yes. I see. You did not do this to yourself shaving, it appears.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It was the Trollocs, Aes Sedai,” Bain said. “When we came out of the Ways in the mountains.” Chiad touched her arm, and she stopped.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I locked the Waygate,” Loial added quickly. “No one will use it until it is opened from this side.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I thought that must be how they were coming,” Verin murmured, half to herself. “Moiraine did say they were using the Ways. Sooner or later that is going to present us with a real problem.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin wondered what she thought that was.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The Ways,” Alanna said, still holding his head. “<span class="calibre18">Ta’veren!</span> Young heroes!” She made the words sound approving and close to a curse, both together.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I am not a hero,” he told her stolidly. “The Ways were the fastest way to get here. That’s all.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Green sister went on as if he had not spoken. “I will never understand why the Amyrlin Seat let you three go your way. Elaida has been having fits over you three, and she is not the only one, just the most vehement. With the seals weakening and the Last Battle coming, the last thing we need is three <span class="calibre18">ta’veren</span> running about loose. I would have tied a string to each of you, even bonded you.” He tried to pull back, but she tightened her grip and smiled. “I am not so lost to custom yet as to bond a man against his will. Not quite yet.” He was not sure how far from it she was; the smile did not reach her eyes. She fingered the half-healed cut on his cheek. “This has gone too long since it was done. Even Healing will leave a scar now.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I don’t need to be pretty,” he muttered—just well enough to do what he had to—and Faile laughed aloud.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Who told you that?” Faile said. Surprisingly, she shared a smile with Alanna.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin frowned, wondering if they were making fun of him, but before he could say anything, the Healing hit him, like being turned to ice. All he could do was gasp. The few moments before Alanna released him seemed endless.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">When he had his breath again, the Green sister had Bain’s flame-haired
head between her hands, Verin was seeing to Gaul, and Chiad was testing her left arm, swinging it back and forth with a satisfied expression.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Faile took Alanna’s place beside Perrin and stroked a finger across his cheek, along the scar beneath his eye. “A beauty mark,” she said, smiling slightly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“A what?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Oh, just something Domani women do. It was just an idle comment.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Despite her smile, or maybe because of it, he scowled suspiciously. She <span class="calibre18">was</span> making fun of him, only he did not understand how, exactly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Ihvon slipped into the room, whispered in Alanna’s ear, and vanished outside again at her whisper. He hardly made a sound even on the wooden floor. A few moments later the scrape of boots on the steps announced new arrivals.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin sprang to his feet as Tam al’Thor and Abell Cauthon appeared in the doorway, bows in hand, with the rumpled clothes and gray-flecked two-day beards of men who had been sleeping rough. They had been hunting; four rabbits hung at Tam’s belt, three at Abell’s. It was obvious they were expecting the Aes Sedai, and visitors, too, but they stared in amazement at Loial, more than half again as tall as either of them, with his tufted ears and broad snout of a nose. A flicker of recognition crossed Tam’s bluff, lined face at sight of the Aiel.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Tam’s gaze only rested thoughtfully on them for a moment, though, before coming to rest on Perrin with a start almost as big as for Loial. He was a sturdy, deep-chested man despite hair that was nearly all gray, the sort it would take an earthquake to knock off his feet and more than that to fluster. “Perrin, lad!” he exclaimed. “Is Rand with you?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What about Mat?” Abell added eagerly. He had the look of an older, graying Mat, but with more serious eyes. A man not thickened much by age, with an agile step.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“They are well,” Perrin told them. “In Tear.” He caught Verin’s glance from the corner of his eye; she knew very well what Tear meant for Rand. Alanna hardly seemed to be paying attention at all. “They would have come with me, but we didn’t know how bad things are.” That was true on both counts, he was sure. “Mat spends his time dicing—and winning—and kissing the girls. Rand . . . . Well, the last I saw of Rand, he was wearing a fancy coat and had a pretty golden-haired girl on his arm.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“That sounds like my Mat,” Abell chuckled.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Maybe it’s as well they didn’t come,” Tam said more slowly, “what
with the Trollocs. And the Whitecloaks . . . .” He shrugged. “You know the Trollocs returned?” Perrin nodded. “Was that Aes Sedai right? Moiraine. Were they after you three lads, that Winternight? Did you ever find out why?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Brown sister gave Perrin a warning look. Alanna appeared absorbed in rummaging through her saddlebags, but he thought she was listening now. Neither was what made him hesitate, though. There was just no way to come out and tell Tam that his son could channel, that Rand was the Dragon Reborn. How could he tell a man something like that? Instead, he said, “You will have to ask Moiraine. Aes Sedai don’t tell you any more than they have to.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I have noticed,” Tam said dryly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Both Aes Sedai were definitely listening, and making no secret of it now. Alanna arched an icy eyebrow at Tam, and Abell shifted his feet as if he thought Tam was pushing his luck, but it would take more than a stare to upset Tam.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Can we talk outside?” Perrin asked the two men. “I want a breath of air.” He wanted to talk without Aes Sedai eavesdropping and watching, but he could hardly say so.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Tam and Abell were agreeable, and perhaps as eager to escape Verin and Alanna’s scrutiny as he, but first there was the matter of the rabbits, all of which they handed over to Alanna.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We meant to keep two for ourselves,” Abell said, “but it seems you have more mouths to feed.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“There is no need for this.” The Green sister sounded as though she had said as much often before.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We like to pay for what we get,” Tam told her, sounding the same. “The Aes Sedai were kind enough to do a little Healing for us,” he added to Perrin, “and we want to stock up credit in case we need it again.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin nodded. He could understand not wanting to take a gift from Aes Sedai. “An Aes Sedai’s gift always has a hook in it,” the old saying went. Well, he knew the truth of that. But it did not really matter whether you took the gift or paid for it; Aes Sedai managed to set the hook anyway. Verin was watching him with a tiny smile, as if she knew what he was thinking.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">As the three men started out, carrying their bows, Faile rose to follow. Perrin shook his head at her, and amazingly she sat back down. He wondered if she was ill.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">After pausing so Tam and Abell could admire Stepper and Swallow, they strolled off a way under the trees. The sun slanted westward, lengthening shadows. The older men made a few jokes about his beard, but they never mentioned his eyes. Strangely, the omission did not bother him. He had more important worries than whether somebody thought his eyes peculiar.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Responding to Abell’s query as to whether “that thing” was any good for straining soup, he rubbed his beard and said mildly, “Faile likes it.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Oh-ho,” Tam chuckled. “That’s the girl, is it? A spirited look to her, lad. She’ll have you lying awake nights trying to tell up from down.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Only one way to handle that sort,” Abell said, nodding. “Let her think she’s running things. That way, when it’s important, and you say different, by the time she gets over the shock of it, you’ll have matters arranged as you want, and it will be too late for her to badger you about changing it.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">That seemed to Perrin a great deal like what Mistress al’Vere had told Faile about handling men. He wondered if Abell and Marin had ever compared notes. Not likely. Perhaps it was worth trying with Faile. Only, she seemed to have her own way in any case.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He glanced over his shoulder. The sickhouse was almost hidden by the trees. They had to be safe from the Aes Sedai’s ears. He listened carefully, drew a deep breath. A woodpecker drummed somewhere in the distance. There were squirrels in the leafy branches overhead, and a fox had passed this way not long ago with its kill, a rabbit. Aside from the three of them, there was no man scent, nothing to indicate a hidden Warder listening. Perhaps he was being too cautious, but good reasons or no, he could not get past the coincidence of both Aes Sedai being women he had met before, one a woman Egwene did not trust, the other a woman he was not sure he trusted.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Do you stay here?” he asked. “With Verin and Alanna?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Hardly,” Abell replied. “How could a man sleep with Aes Sedai under the same roof? What there is of it.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We thought this would be a good place to hide,” Tam said, “but they were here before us. I think those Warders might have killed both of us if Marin and some others of the Women’s Circle hadn’t been here then, too.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Abell grimaced. “I think it was the Aes Sedai finding out who we were that stopped it. Who our sons were, I mean. They show too much interest in you boys to suit me.” He hesitated, fingering his bow. “That
Alanna let slip that you’re <span class="calibre18">ta’veren.</span> All three of you. I’ve heard Aes Sedai can’t lie.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I haven’t seen any signs of it in me,” Perrin said wryly. “Or Mat.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Tam glanced at him when he did not mention Rand—he was going to have to learn to lie better, trying to keep his own secrets and everybody else’s, too—but what the older man said was, “Maybe you just don’t know what to look for. How is it you come to be traveling with an Ogier and three Aiel?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The last peddler I saw said there were Aiel this side of the Spine of the World,” Abell put in, “but I didn’t believe him. Said he’d heard there were Aiel in Murandy, of all places, or maybe Altara. He wasn’t too certain of exactly where, but a long way from the Waste.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“None of that has anything to do with <span class="calibre18">ta’veren</span>,” Perrin said. “Loial is a friend, and he came to help me. Gaul is a friend, too, I suppose. Bain and Chiad came with Faile, not me. It’s all sort of complicated, but it just happened. Nothing to do with <span class="calibre18">ta’veren.</span>”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Well, whatever the reason,” Abell said, “the Aes Sedai are interested in you lads. Tam and I traveled all the way to Tar Valon last year, to the White Tower, trying to find out where you were. We could hardly unearth one to admit she knew your names, but it was plain they were hiding something. The Keeper of the Chronicles had us on a boat heading downriver, our pockets stuffed with gold and our heads full of vague assurances, almost before we could make our bows. I don’t like the idea the Tower may be using Mat some way.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin wished he could tell Mat’s father nothing like that was going on, but he was not sure he was up to that big a lie with a straight face. Moiraine was not watching Mat because she liked his grin; Mat was tangled as deeply with the Tower as he himself, maybe deeper. The three of them were all tied tight, and the Tower held the strings.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">A silence descended on them, until at last Tam said quietly, “Lad, about your family. I’ve sad news.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I know,” Perrin said quickly, and the hush fell again, with each staring at his own boots. Quiet was what was needed. A few moments to pull back from painful emotions and the embarrassment of having them plain on your face.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Wings fluttered, and Perrin looked up to see a large raven alighting in an oak fifty paces away, beady black eyes sharp on the three men. His hand darted for his quiver, but even as he drew fletchings to cheek, two arrows
knocked the raven from its perch. Tam and Abell were already nocking anew, eyes scanning the trees and sky for more of the black birds. There was nothing.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Tam’s shot had taken the raven in the head, which was no surprise and no accident. Perrin had not lied when he told Faile these two men were better than he with the bow. No one in the Two Rivers could match Tam’s shooting.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Filthy things,” Abell muttered, putting a foot on the bird to pull his arrow free. Cleaning the arrow point in the dirt, he returned it to his quiver. “They’re everywhere nowadays.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The Aes Sedai told us about them,” Tam said, “spying for the Fades, and we spread the word. The Women’s Circle did, too. Nobody paid much mind until they started attacking sheep, though, pecking out eyes, killing some. The clip will be bad enough this year without that. Not that it matters much, I suppose. Between Whitecloaks and Trollocs, I doubt we’ll see any merchants after our wool this year.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Some fool has gone crazy over it,” Abell added. “Maybe more than one. We’ve found all sorts of dead animals. Rabbits, deer, foxes, even a bear. Killed and left to rot. Most not even skinned. It’s a man, or men, not Trollocs; I found boot prints. A big man, but too small for a Trolloc. A shame and a waste.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Slayer. Slayer here, and not just in the wolf dream. Slayer and Trollocs. The man in the dream had seemed familiar. Perrin scuffed dirt and leaves over the dead raven with his boot. There would be plenty of time for Trollocs later. A lifetime, if need be. “I promised Mat I’d look after Bode and Eldrin, Master Cauthon. How hard will it be to get them, and the others, free?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Hard,” Abell sighed, his face sagging. Suddenly he looked his age and more. “Powerful hard. I got close enough to see Natti after they took her, walking outside the tent where they’re holding everybody. I could see her—with a couple of hundred Whitecloaks between us. I got a little careless, and one of them put an arrow through me. If Tam hadn’t hauled me back here to the Aes Sedai . . . .”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It’s a good-sized camp,” Tam said, “right under Watch Hill. Seven or eight hundred men. Patrols, day and night, with the heaviest concentration from Watch Hill down to Emond’s Field. If they spread out more, it would make things easier for us, but except for a hundred men or so at Taren Ferry, they’ve just about given the rest of the Two Rivers over to the Trollocs. It’s bad down around Deven Ride, I hear. Another farm burned almost every
night. The same between Watch Hill and the River Taren. Bringing Natti and the others out will be hard, and after, we’ll have to hope the Aes Sedai will let them stay here. That pair aren’t too pleased at anyone knowing where they are.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Surely someone will hide them,” Perrin protested. “You can’t tell me everyone’s turned their backs on you. They don’t really believe you’re Darkfriends?” Even as he said it, he was remembering Cenn Buie.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“No, not that,” Tam said, “except for a few fools. Plenty of folk will give us a meal, or a night in the barn, sometimes even a bed, but you have to understand they’re uneasy about helping people the Whitecloaks are chasing. It’s nothing to blame them for. Things are stone hard, and most men are trying to look after their own families the best they can. Asking someone to take in Natti and the girls, Haral and Alsbet . . . . Well, it might be asking too much.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I thought better of Two Rivers folk than that,” Perrin muttered.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Abell managed a weak smile. “Most people feel caught between two millstones, Perrin. They’re just hoping they aren’t ground to flour between Whitecloaks and Trollocs.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“They should stop hoping and do something.” For a moment Perrin felt abashed. He had not been living here; he had no idea what it was like. But he was still right. As long as the people hid behind the Children of the Light, they would have to put up with whatever the Children wanted to do, whether taking books or arresting women and girls. “Tomorrow I’ll take a look at this Whitecloak camp. There has to be some way to free them. And once they are, we can turn our attention to Trollocs. A Warder once told me Trollocs call the Aiel Waste  ‘the Dying Ground.’ I mean to make them give that name to the Two Rivers.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Perrin,” Tam began, then stopped, looking troubled.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin knew his eyes caught the light, there in the shadows under the oak. His face felt carved from rock.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Tam sighed. “First we’ll see about Natti and the others. Then we can decide what to do about the Trollocs.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Don’t let it eat you inside, boy,” Abell said softly. “Hate can grow till it burns everything else out of you.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Nothing is eating me,” Perrin told them in a level voice. “I just mean to do what needs doing.” He ran a thumb along the edge of his axe. What needed doing.</span></div>
<div class="p-blanc"><span class="calibre22"> <br class="calibre8"/></span></div>
<div class="p-blanc"><span class="calibre22"> <br class="calibre8"/></span></div>


<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Dain Bornhald held himself straight in his saddle as the hundred he had taken on patrol approached Watch Hill. Fewer than a hundred, now. Eleven saddles had cloak-wrapped bodies tied across them, and twenty-three more men nursed wounds. The Trollocs had laid a neat ambush; it might have succeeded against soldiers less well trained, less tough than the Children. What troubled him was that this was his third patrol to be attacked in force. Not a chance encounter, not happening on Trollocs killing and burning, but meeting a planned attack. And only patrols he led personally. The Trollocs tried to avoid the others. The fact presented worrisome questions, and the answers he came up with gave no solutions.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The sun was dropping. A few lights already appeared in the village that covered the hill from top to bottom with thatched roofs. The only tile roof stood at the crest, on the White Boar, the inn. Another evening he might have gone up there for a cup of wine, despite the nervous silence that closed in at the sight of a white cloak with a golden sunburst. He seldom drank, but he sometimes enjoyed being around people outside the Children; after a time they would forget his presence to some extent, and begin to laugh and talk among themselves again. On another evening. Tonight he wanted to be alone to think.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">There was activity among the hundred or so colorful wagons gathered less than half a mile from the foot of the hill, men and women in even brighter hues than their wagons, examining horses and harness, loading things that had been lying about the camp for weeks. It seemed the Traveling People meant to live up to their name, probably at first light.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Farran!” The thick-bodied hundredman heeled his horse closer, and Bornhald nodded toward the Tuatha’an caravan. “Inform the Seeker that if he wishes to move his people, they will move south.” His maps said there was no crossing of the Taren except at Taren Ferry, but he had begun learning how old they were as soon as he crossed the river. No one was leaving the Two Rivers to perhaps seal his command into a trap as long as he could stop it. “And Farran? There is no need to use boots or fists, yes? Words will suffice. This Raen has ears.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“By your command, Lord Bornhald.” The hundredman sounded only a little disappointed. Touching gauntleted fist to heart, he wheeled away toward the Tuatha’an encampment. He would not like it, but he would obey. Despise the Traveling People as he might, he was a good soldier.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The sight of his own camp brought a moment of pride to Bornhald, the long neat rows of wedge-roofed white tents, the picket lines for the horses
precisely arrayed. Even here in this Light-forsaken corner of the world, the Children maintained themselves, never allowing discipline to slack. It was Light-forsaken. The Trollocs proved that. If they burned farms, it only meant some folk here were pure. Some. The rest bowed, and said “yes, my Lord,” “as you wish, my Lord,” and stubbornly went their own way as soon as his back was turned. Besides which, they were hiding an Aes Sedai. The second day south of the Taren they had killed a Warder; the man’s color-shifting cloak had been sufficient proof. Bornhald hated Aes Sedai, meddling with the One Power as if Breaking the World once was not enough. They would do it again if they were not stopped. His momentary good mood faded like spring snow.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">His eye sought out the tent where the prisoners were kept, except for a brief exercise period each day, one at a time. None would try running when it meant leaving the others behind. Not that running would get them more that a dozen paces—a guard stood at either end of the tent, and a dozen paces in any direction took in another twenty Children—but he wanted as little trouble as possible. Trouble sparked trouble. If rough treatment was needed with the prisoners, it might raise resentment in the village to a point where something had to be done about it. Byar was a fool. He—and others, Farran especially—wanted to put the prisoners to the question. Bornhald was not a Questioner, and he did not like to use their methods. Nor did he mean to let Farran anywhere near those girls, even if they were Darkfriends, as Ordeith claimed.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Darkfriends or no Darkfriends, he realized more and more that all he really wanted was one Darkfriend. More than the Trollocs, more than Aes Sedai, he wanted Perrin Aybara. He could hardly credit Byar’s tales of the man running with wolves, but Byar was clear enough that Aybara had led Bornhald’s father into a Darkfriend trap, led Geofram Bornhald to his death on Toman Head at the hands of the Seanchan Darkfriends and their Aes Sedai allies. Perhaps, if neither of the Luhhans talked soon, he might let Byar have his way with the blacksmith. Either the man would crack, or his wife would, watching. One of them would give him the means to find Perrin Aybara.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">When he dismounted in front of his tent, Byar was there to meet him, stiff and gaunt as a scarecrow. Bornhald glanced distastefully toward a much smaller collection of tents apart from the rest. The wind was from that direction, and he could smell the other camp. They did not keep their picket lines clean, or themselves. “Ordeith is back, it seems, yes?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Yes, my Lord Bornhald.” Byar stopped, and Bornhald looked at him
questioningly. “They report a skirmish with Trollocs to the south. Two dead. Six wounded, they claim.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“And who are the dead?” Bornhald asked quietly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Child Joelin and Child Gomanes, my Lord Bornhald.” Byar’s hollow-cheeked expression never changed.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Bornhald drew off his steel-backed gauntlets slowly. The two he had sent off to accompany Ordeith, to see what he did on his forays south. Carefully, he did not raise his voice. “My compliments to Master Ordeith, Byar, and—No! No compliments. Tell him, in these words, that I will have his scrawny bones before me now. Tell him, Byar, and bring him if you must arrest him and those filthy wretches who disgrace the Children. Go.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Bornhald held his anger until he was inside his tent, flap lowered, then swept maps and writing case from his camp table with a snarl. Ordeith must think him an imbecile. Twice he had sent men with the fellow, and twice they had been the only deaths in “a skirmish with Trollocs” that left no wounded to show among the rest. Always to the south. The man was obsessed with Emond’s Field. Well, he himself might have had his camp there, if not for . . . . No point to it now. He had the Luhhans here. They would give him Perrin Aybara, one way or another. Watch Hill was a much better site if he had to move to Taren Ferry quickly. Military considerations before personal.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">For the thousandth time he wondered why the Lord Captain Commander had sent him here. The people seemed no different from those he had seen a hundred other places. Except that only the Taren Ferry folk showed any enthusiasm for rooting out their own Darkfriends. The rest stared with a sullen stubbornness when the Dragon’s Fang was scrawled on a door. A village always knew who its own undesirables were; they were always ready to cleanse themselves, with a little encouragement, and any Darkfriends were certain to be swept up with the others the people wanted gone. But not here. The black scrawl of a sharp fang on a door might as well be new whitewash for all of its real effect. And the Trollocs. Had Pedron Niall known the Trollocs would come when he wrote those orders? How could he have? But if not, why had he sent enough of the Children to put down a small rebellion? And why under the Light had the Lord Captain Commander burdened him with a murderous madman?</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The tent flap swept aside, and Ordeith swaggered in. His fine gray coat was embroidered with silver, but stained heavily. His scrawny neck was dirty, too, jutting out of his collar and giving him the look of a turtle. “A
good evening to you, my Lord Bornhald. A gracious good evening, and splendid.” The Lugard accent was heavy today.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What happened to Child Joelin and Child Gomanes, Ordeith?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Such a terrible thing, my Lord. When we came on the Trollocs, Child Gomanes bravely—” Bornhald struck him across the face with his gauntlets. Staggering, the bony man put a hand to his split lip, examined the red on his fingers. The smile on his face no longer mocked. It looked viperish. “Are you forgetting who signed my commission now, lordling? Pedron Niall will be hanging you with your mother’s guts if I say a word, after he has the both of you skinned alive.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“That is if you are alive to speak this word, yes?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Ordeith snarled, crouching like some wild thing, spittle bubbling. Slowly he shook himself, slowly straightened. “We must work together.” The Lugarder accent was gone, replaced by a grander, more commanding tone. Bornhald preferred the taunting Lugarder voice to the slightly oily, barely veiled contempt in this one. “The Shadow lies all around us here. Not simply Trollocs and Myrddraal. They are the least of it. Three were spawned here, Darkfriends meant to shake the world, their breeding guided by the Dark One for a thousand years or more. Rand al’Thor. Mat Cauthon. Perrin Aybara. You know their names. In this place, forces are loosed that will harrow the world. Creatures of the Shadow walk the night, tainting men’s hearts, corrupting men’s dreams. Scourge this land. Scourge it, and they will come. Rand al’Thor. Mat Cauthon. Perrin Aybara.” He almost caressed the last name.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Bornhald drew ragged breath. He was not sure how Ordeith had discovered what he wanted here; one day the man had simply revealed his knowledge. “I covered over what you did at the Aybara farm—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Scourge them.” There was a hint of madness in that grand voice, and sweat on Ordeith’s brow. “Flay them, and the three will come.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Bornhald raised his voice. “Covered it over because I had to.” There had been no choice. If the truth came out, he would have more than sullen stares to contend with. The last thing he needed was open rebellion on top of Trollocs. “But I will not condone the murder of Children. Do you hear me? What is it you do that you need to hide from the Children?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Do you doubt the Shadow will do whatever is needed to stop me?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Do you doubt it?” Ordeith leaned forward intently. “You saw the Gray Men.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Bornhald hesitated. Fifty of the Children around him, in the middle of Watch Hill, and no one had noticed the pair with their daggers. He had looked right at them and not seen. Until Ordeith killed the pair. The scrawny little fellow had gained considerable standing with the men for that. Later Bornhald had buried the daggers deep. Those blades had looked to be steel, but a touch seared like molten metal. The first earth thrown on them in the pit had hissed and steamed. “You believe they were after you?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Oh, yes, my Lord Bornhald. After me. Whatever it takes to stop me. The Shadow itself wants to stop me.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“That still says nothing of murdered—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I must do what I do in secret.” It was a whisper, almost a hiss. “The Shadow can enter men’s minds to find me out, enter men’s thoughts and dreams. Would you like to die in a dream? It can happen.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You are . . . mad.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Give me a free hand, and I will give you Perrin Aybara. That is what Pedron Niall’s orders require. A free hand for me, and I will place Perrin Aybara in yours.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Bornhald was silent for a long time. “I do not want to look at you,” he said finally. “Get out.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">When Ordeith was gone, Bornhald shivered. What was the Lord Captain Commander up to with this man? But if it put Aybara in his grasp . . . . Tossing his gauntlets down, he began digging through his belongings. Somewhere he had a flask of brandy.</span></div>
<div class="p-blanc"><span class="calibre22"> <br class="calibre8"/></span></div>
<div class="p-blanc"><span class="calibre22"> <br class="calibre8"/></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="calibre22">The man who called himself Ordeith, even sometimes thought of himself as Ordeith, slunk through the tents of the Children of the Light, watching the white-cloaked men with a wary eye. Useful tools, ignorant tools, but not to be trusted. Especially not Bornhald; that one might have to be disposed of, if he became too troublesome. Byar would be much more easily handled. But not yet. There were other matters more important. Some of the soldiers nodded respectfully as he passed. He showed them his teeth in what they took for a friendly smile. Tools, and fools.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">His eyes skittered hungrily across the tent holding the prisoners. They could wait. For a while yet. A little while longer. They were only tidbits anyway. Bait. He should have restrained himself at the Aybara farm, but Con Aybara had laughed in his face, and Joslyn had called him
a filthy-minded little fool for naming her son Darkfriend. Well, they had learned, screaming, burning. In spite of himself he giggled under his breath. Tidbits.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He could feel one of those he hated out there somewhere, south, toward Emond’s Field. Which one? It did not matter. Rand al’Thor was the only really important one. He would have known if it was al’Thor. Rumor had not drawn him yet, but it would. Ordeith shivered with desire. It had to be so. More tales must be gotten past Bornhald’s guards at Taren Ferry, more reports of the scouring of the Two Rivers, to drift to Rand al’Thor’s ears and sear his brain. First al’Thor, then the Tower, for what they had taken from him. He would have all that was his by right.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Everything had been ticking along like a fine clock, even with Bornhald impeding, until this new one appeared with his Gray Men. Ordeith scrubbed bony fingers through greasy hair. Why could not his dreams at least be his own? He was a puppet no longer, danced about by Myrddraal and Forsaken, by the Dark One himself. He pulled the strings now. They could not stop him, could not kill him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Nothing can kill me,” he muttered, scowling. “Not me. I have survived since the Trolloc Wars.” Well, a part of him had. He laughed shrilly, hearing madness in the cackle, knowing it, not caring.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">A young Whitecloak officer frowned at him. This time there was nothing of a smile in Ordeith’s bared teeth, and the fuzzy-cheeked lad recoiled. Ordeith hurried on in a slinking shuffle.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Flies buzzed about his own tents, and sullen, suspicious eyes flinched away from his. The white cloaks were soiled here. But the swords were sharp, and obedience instant and unquestioning. Bornhald thought these men were still his. Pedron Niall believed it, too, believed Ordeith his tame creature. Fools.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Twitching aside his tent flap, Ordeith went in to examine his prisoner, stretched out between two pegs thick enough to hold a wagon team. Good steel chain quivered as he checked it, but he had calculated how much was needed, then doubled it. As well he had. One loop less, and those stout steel links would have broken.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">With a sigh, he seated himself on the edge of his bed. The lamps were already lit, more than a dozen, leaving no shadow anywhere. The tent was as bright inside as noonday. “Have you thought over my proposal? Accept, and you walk free. Refuse . . . . I know how to hurt your sort. I can make you scream through endless dying. Forever dying, forever screaming.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The chains hummed at a jerk; the stakes driven deep into the ground creaked. “Very well.” The Myrddraal’s voice was dried snakeskin crumbling. “I accept. Release me.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Ordeith smiled. It thought him a fool. It would learn. They all would. “First, the matter of . . . shall we say, agreements and accord?” As he talked, the Myrddraal began to sweat.</span></div>
