<div class="subtitle-chapter"><span class="calibre2"><span class="calibre18">Sharp Lessons</span></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">T</span>he Heart of the Stone in <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span> was as Egwene remembered it in the real world, huge polished redstone columns rising to a distant ceiling, and, beneath the great central dome, <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> driven into the pale floorstones. Only people were missing. The golden lamps were not lit, yet there was a sort of light, somehow dim and sharp at the same time, that seemed to come from everywhere at once, or nowhere. It was often like that, indoors in <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod.</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">What she did not expect was the woman standing beyond the glittering crystal sword and peering off into the pallid shadows among the columns. The way she was dressed startled Egwene. Bare feet, and wide trousers of brocaded yellow silk. Above a darker yellow sash, she was quite bare except for golden chains hanging around her neck. Tiny gold rings decorated her ears in sparkling rows, and most startling of all, another pierced her nose, with a thin, medallion-lined chain running from nose ring to one of the rings in her left ear.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Elayne?” Egwene gasped, gathering her shawl around her as though she were the one with no blouse. She had garbed herself as a Wise One, this time, for no particular reason.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Daughter-Heir leaped, and when she came down facing Egwene she was wearing a demure gown of pale green with a high, embroidered neck and long sleeves that dangled points over her hands. No earrings. No
nose ring. “It is how the Sea Folk women dress at sea,” she said hurriedly, with a furious blush. “I wanted to see how it felt, and this seemed the best place. I couldn’t do it on the ship, after all.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“How does it feel?” Egwene asked curiously.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Cold, actually.” Elayne looked around at the surrounding columns. “And it makes you feel people are staring at you, even when there’s no one there.” Abruptly she laughed. “Poor Thom and Juilin. They do not know where to look most of the time. Half the crew are women.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Studying the columns herself, Egwene shrugged uncomfortably. It did feel as if they were being watched. No doubt it was just because they were the only people in the Stone. No one who had access to <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span> could expect to find anyone to watch, here. “Thom? Thom Merrilin? And Juilin Sandar? Are <span class="calibre18">they</span> with you?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Oh, Egwene, Rand sent them. Rand and Lan. Well, Moiraine sent Thom, actually, but Rand sent Master Sandar. To help us. Nynaeve is quite set up about it, about Lan, though of course she won’t let on.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene smothered a small smile. <span class="calibre18">Nynaeve</span> was set up? Elayne’s face was beaming, and her dress had changed again, to a <span class="calibre18">much</span> lower neckline, apparently without her realizing it. The <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal</span>, the twisted stone ring, helped the Daughter-Heir reach the World of Dreams as easily as Egwene did, but it did not confer control. That had to be learned. Stray thoughts—such as how she might like to look for Rand—could still alter things for Elayne.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“How is he?” Elayne’s voice was a strange blend of forced casualness and apprehension.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Well,” Egwene said. “I think he is.” She made it a full report. The Portal Stones, and Rhuidean—as much as she knew from what she had heard; what she had managed to infer from talk of seeing through ancestors’ eyes—the strange creature from the Dragon banner marked on Rand’s forearms, Bair’s revelation that he was the Aiel’s doom, the summons of the clan chiefs to Alcair Dal. Amys and the other Wise Ones should be doing that even now; she fervently hoped they were. She even told the strange story of Rand’s true parents, in a shorter form. “I don’t know, though. He has been acting stranger than ever, since, and Mat hardly less. I don’t mean that he’s mad, but . . . . He is as hard as Rhuarc or Lan, in some ways at least; maybe harder. He’s planning something, I think—something he doesn’t mean anybody to know—and he is in a rush to get to it. It is worrying. Sometimes I have the feeling he doesn’t see people anymore, only pieces on a stones board.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne did not look worried, or not about that, at any rate. “He is what he is, Egwene. A king, or a general, cannot always afford to see people. When a ruler has to do what is right for a nation, there are times when some will be hurt by what is best for the whole. Rand <span class="calibre18">is</span> a king, Egwene, even if without a nation unless you count Tear, and if he won’t do anything that will hurt anyone, he will end by hurting everyone.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene sniffed. It might make sense, but she did not have to like it. People were people, and they had to be seen as people. “There is more. Some of the Wise Ones can channel. I don’t know how many, but I suspect more than a few, to some degree. From what Amys tells me, they find every last woman who has the spark born in her.” No Aiel women died trying to teach themselves to channel while not even knowing what they were trying to do; there was no such thing as a wilder among the Aiel. Men who learned they could channel faced a grimmer fate; they went north, to the Great Blight and maybe beyond, to the Blasted Lands and Shayol Ghul. “Going to kill the Dark One,” they called it. None survived long enough to face madness. “Aviendha is one with the spark, it turns out. She’ll be very strong, I think. Amys thinks so, too.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Aviendha,” Elayne said wonderingly. “Of course. I should have known. I felt the same kinship for Jorin on first sight that I did for her. And for you, for that matter.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Jorin?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne grimaced. “I promised I would keep her secret, and the first chance I get, I let my tongue run wild. Well, I don’t suppose you will harm her or her sisters. Jorin is Windfinder on <span class="calibre18">Wavedancer</span>, Egwene. She can channel, and so can some of the other Windfinders.” She glanced at the columns around them, and her neckline was suddenly back up under her chin. She adjusted a dark lace shawl that had not been there a moment before, covering her hair and shadowing her face. “Egwene, you mustn’t tell anyone. Jorin is afraid the Tower will try to force them to become Aes Sedai, or try to control them in some fashion. I promised I would do what I can not to let that happen.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I won’t tell,” Egwene said slowly. Wise Ones and Windfinders. Women able to channel among both, and none who had taken the Three Oaths, bound by the Oath Rod. The Oaths were supposed to make people trust Aes Sedai, or at least not fear their power, but Aes Sedai still had to move in secret as often as not. Wise Ones—and Windfinders, she was willing to wager—had honored places in their societies. Without being bound to supposedly make them safe. It was something to think on.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Nynaeve and I are ahead of schedule, too, Egwene. Jorin has been teaching me to work the weather—you would not believe the size of the flows of Air she can weave!—and between us, we’ve had <span class="calibre18">Wavedancer</span> moving as fast as he ever has, and that is <span class="calibre18">fast.</span> We should be in Tanchico in another three days, maybe two, according to Coine. She’s the Sailmistress, the captain. Ten days from Tear to Tanchico, perhaps. That is with stopping to talk with every Atha’an Miere ship we see. Egwene, the Sea Folk think Rand is their Coramoor.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“They do?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Coine has some of what happened in Tear wrong—she assumes the Aes Sedai serve Rand now, for one thing; Nynaeve and I thought it best not to put her straight about that—but as soon as she tells another Sailmistress, they’re all ready to spread the word and serve Rand. I believe they will do anything he asks of them.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I wish the Aiel were so accepting,” Egwene sighed. “Rhuarc thinks some of them might refuse to acknowledge him, Rhuidean Dragons or no. One fellow, a man called Couladin, I’m sure would kill him in a minute given half a chance.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne took a step forward. “You will see that doesn’t happen.” It was not a question or a request. There was a sharp light in her blue eyes, and a bared dagger in her hand.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I will do the best I can. Rhuarc is giving him bodyguards.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne seemed to see the dagger for the first time, and gave a start. The blade vanished. “You must teach me whatever Amys is teaching you, Egwene. It is disconcerting to have things appear and disappear, or suddenly realize I’m wearing different clothes. It just happens.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I will. When I have time.” She had been in <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span> too long already. “Elayne, if I am not here when we are supposed to meet next, don’t worry. I will try, but I may not be able to come. Be sure to tell Nynaeve. If I do not come, check every night thereafter. I won’t be more than one or two late, I’m sure.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“If you say so,” Elayne said doubtfully. “It will surely take weeks to find out if Liandrin and the others are in Tanchico or not. Thom seems to think the city will be very confused.” Her eyes went to <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>, driven half its length into the floor. “Why did he do that, do you think?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He said it will hold the Tairens to him. As long as they know it’s there, they have to know he is coming back. Maybe he knows what he is talking about. I hope so.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Oh. I thought . . . perhaps he . . . was angry about . . . something.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene frowned at her. This sudden diffidence was not like Elayne at all. “Angry about what?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Oh, nothing. It was just a thought. Egwene, I gave him two letters before leaving Tear. Do you know how he took them?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“No, I don’t. Did you say something you think might have angered him?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Of course not.” Elayne laughed gaily; it sounded forced. Her dress was suddenly dark wool, stout enough for a hard winter. “I would have to be a fool to write things to make him angry.” Her hair sprang up in all directions, like a crazed crown. She was not aware of it. “I am trying to make him love me, after all. Just trying to make him love me. Oh, why can’t men be simple? Why do they have to cause such difficulties? At least he’s away from Berelain.” The wool became silk again, cut even lower than before; her hair made shimmers on her shoulders to shame the gown’s sheen. She hesitated, nibbling her lower lip. “Egwene? If you find the chance, would you tell him I meant what I said in—Egwene? Egwene!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Something snatched Egwene. The Heart of the Stone dwindled into blackness as if she were being hauled away by the scruff of her neck.</span></div>
<div class="p-blanc"><span class="calibre22"> <br class="calibre8"/></span></div>
<div class="p-blanc"><span class="calibre22"> <br class="calibre8"/></span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">With a gasp, Egwene started awake, heart pounding, staring up the low roof of the night-darkened tent over her head. Only a little moonlight crept in at the open sides. She lay under her blankets—the Waste was as cold at night as it was hot during the day, and the brazier that exuded the sweetish smell of dried dung burning gave little warmth—beneath her blankets right where she had lain down to sleep. But what had pulled her back?</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Abruptly she became aware of Amys, sitting cross-legged beside her, cloaked in shadows. The Wise One’s murk-shrouded face seemed as dark and forboding as the night.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Did you do that, Amys?” she said angrily. “You have no right to just haul me about. I am Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah . . .” The lie came easily to her lips now. “ . . . and you have no right—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Amys cut her off with a grim voice. “Beyond the Dragonwall, in the White Tower, you are Aes Sedai. Here, you are an ignorant pupil, a fool child crawling through a den of vipers.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I know I said I would not go to <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span> without you,” Egwene said, trying to sound reasonable, “but—”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Something seized her ankles, hauled her feet into the air; blankets tumbled away, her shift dropped to bunch in her armpits. Upside down, she hung with her face level with that of Amys. Furious, she opened herself to <span class="calibre18">saidar</span>—and found herself blocked.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You wanted to go off alone,” Amys hissed softly. “You were warned, but you had to go.” Her eyes seemed to glow in the dark, brighter and brighter. “Never a care for what might be waiting. There are things in dreams to shatter the bravest heart.” Around eyes like blue coals, her face melted, stretched. Scales sprouted where skin had been; her jaws thrust out, lined with sharp teeth. “Things to <span class="calibre18">eat</span> the bravest heart,” she growled.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Screaming, Egwene battered vainly at the shield holding her from the True Source. She tried to beat at that horrible face, at the thing that could not be Amys, but something gripped her wrists, stretched her taut and quivering in midair. All she could do was shriek as those jaws closed around her face.</span></div>
<div class="p-blanc"><span class="calibre22"> <br class="calibre8"/></span></div>
<div class="p-blanc"><span class="calibre22"> <br class="calibre8"/></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="calibre22">Screaming, Egwene sat up, clutching at her blankets. With an effort she managed to snap her mouth shut, but she could do nothing about the shudders that racked her. She was in the tent—or was she? There was Amys, cross-legged in the shadows, glowing with <span class="calibre18">saidar</span>—or was it she? Desperately, she opened herself to the Source, and nearly howled when she found the barrier again. Tossing the blankets aside, she scrambled across the layered rugs on hands and knees, scattered her neatly folded clothes with both hands. She had a belt knife. Where was it? Where? There!</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Sit down,” Amys said acerbically, “before I dose you for vapors and fidgets. You will not like the taste.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene twisted around on her knees, the short knife held in both hands; they would have trembled if not clutched together around the hilt. “Is it really you this time?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I am myself, now and also then. Sharp lessons are the best lessons. Do you mean to stab me?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Hesitating, Egwene sheathed the knife. “You have no right to—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I have every right! You gave me your word. I did not know Aes Sedai could lie. If I am to teach you, I must know you will do as I say. I will not watch a pupil of mine cut her own throat!” Amys sighed; the glow around her vanished, and so did the barrier between Egwene and <span class="calibre18">saidar.</span> “I cannot shield you any longer. You are far stronger than I. In the One Power, you
are. You very nearly battered down my shield. But if you cannot keep your word, I do not know that I want to instruct you.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I will keep my word, Amys. I promise I will. But I have to meet with my friends, in <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod.</span> I promised them, too. Amys, they might need my help, my advice.” Amys’s face was not easy to make out in the darkness, but Egwene did not see any softening. “Please, Amys. You’ve taught me so much already. I think I could find them wherever they are, now. Please, don’t stop when there is so much yet for me to learn. Whatever you want me to do, I will.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Braid your hair,” Amys said in a flat tone.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“My hair?” Egwene said uncertainly. It would certainly be no inconvenience, but why? She wore it loose now, falling below her shoulders, yet it was not that long ago that she had almost burst with pride on the day the Women’s Circle back home had said she was old enough to put her hair in a braid like the one Nynaeve still wore. In the Two Rivers, a braid said you were old enough to be considered a woman.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“One over each ear.” Amys’s voice was still like a flat rock. “If you have no ribbon to twine in the braids, I will give you some. That is how little girls wear their hair among us. Girls too young to be held to their word. When you prove to me that you can keep yours, you can stop wearing it so. But if you lie to me again, I will make you cut your skirts off short, like little girls’ dresses, and find you a doll to carry. When you decide to behave as a woman, you will be treated as a woman. Agree to it, or I will teach you no more.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I will agree if you will accompany me when I must meet—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Agree, <span class="calibre18">Aes Sedai</span>! I do not bargain with children, or those who cannot keep their word. You will do as I say, accept what I choose to give, and no more. Or else go off and get yourself killed on your own. I—will—not—aid it!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene was glad of the dark; it hid her scowl. She <span class="calibre18">had</span> given her word, but this was all so unfair. No one was trying to hedge Rand around with silly rules. Well, perhaps he <span class="calibre18">was</span> different. She was not sure she wanted to trade Amys’s edicts for Couladin’s desiring to put a spear through her, in any case. Mat would certainly not put up with other people’s rules. Yet <span class="calibre18">ta’veren</span> or not, Mat had nothing to learn; all he had to do was be. Very likely he would refuse to learn anything given the chance, unless it had to do with gambling or raising food. She wanted to learn. Sometimes it seemed an unending thirst; however much she absorbed, she could not
quench it. That still did not make it fair. <span class="calibre18">Only the way things are</span>, she thought ruefully.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I agree,” she said. “I will do as you say, accept what you give, and no more.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Good.” After a long pause, as if waiting to see whether Egwene wanted to say more—she wisely held her tongue—Amys added, “I mean to be hard on you, Egwene, but not without purpose. That you think I have taught you much already only shows how little you knew to begin. You have a strong talent for the dream; very likely you will outstrip any of us by far, one day. But if you do not learn what I can teach you—what we four can all teach you—you will never develop that talent fully. It is most likely you will not live long enough to do so.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I will try, Amys.” She thought she managed a good approximation of meekness. Why did the woman not say what she wanted to hear? If Egwene could not go to <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span> alone, then Amys had to come, too, when she next met Elayne. Or it might be Nynaeve, next time.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Good. Do you have anything else to say?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“No, Amys.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The pause was longer this time; Egwene waited as patiently as she could, hands folded on her knees.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“So you can hold your demands inside when you wish,” Amys said at last, “even if it does make you twitch like a goat with the itch. Do I mistake the cause? I can give you an ointment. No? Very well. I will accompany you when you must meet your friends.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Thank you,” Egwene said primly. A goat with an itch indeed!</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“In case you did not listen when I first told you, learning will be neither easy nor short. You think you have worked these last days. Prepare to give real time and effort now.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Amys, I will learn as much as you can teach me, and I will work as hard as you want, but between Rand and the Darkfriends . . . . Time to learn may turn out to be a luxury, and my purse empty.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I know,” Amys said wearily. “He troubles us already. Come. You have wasted enough time with your childishness. There is women’s business to be discussed. Come. The others are waiting.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">For the first time Egwene realized Moiraine’s blankets were empty. She reached for her dress, but Amys said, “That will not be needed. We only go a short way. Throw a blanket around your shoulders and come. I have done a great deal of work for Rand al’Thor already, and I must do more when we are finished.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Shrugging a blanket around her doubtfully, Egwene followed the older woman into the night. It was <span class="calibre18">cold.</span> Skin turning to tight goose bumps, she hopped from bare foot to bare foot over stony ground that seemed little short of ice. After the heat of day, the night seemed as frigid as the heart of a Two Rivers winter. Her breath turned to thin mist in front of her mouth, absorbed immediately by the air. Cold or not, the air was still dry.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">At the rear of the Wise Ones’ camp stood a small tent she had not seen before, low like the others, but staked tightly down all around. To her surprise, Amys began stripping off her clothes, and motioned her to do the same. Clenching her teeth to keep them from chattering, she followed Amys’s example slowly. When the Aiel woman had shed down to her skin, she stood there just as if the night were not freezing, taking deep breaths and flailing herself with her arms before finally ducking inside. Egwene darted after her with alacrity.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Damp heat hit her like a stick between the eyes. Sweat popped out of every pore.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine was already there, and the other Wise Ones, and Aviendha, all bare-skinned and sweating, sitting around a large iron kettle full to the brim with sooty stones. Kettle and stones alike radiated heat. The Aes Sedai looked mostly recovered from her ordeal, though there was a tightness around her eyes that had not been there before.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">As Egwene was gingerly finding a place to sit—no layered rugs here; only rocky ground—Aviendha scooped a handful of water from a smaller kettle at her side and tossed it into the larger one. The water hissed to steam, leaving not even a damp spot on the stones. Aviendha had a sour look on her face. Egwene knew how she felt. Novices in the Tower were also given chores; she was not sure if she had hated scrubbing floors more than pots or the other way around. This task did not look nearly so onerous.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We must discuss what to do about Rand al’Thor,” Bair said when Amys was seated, too.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Do about him?” Egwene said, alarmed. “He has the signs. He is the one you have been looking for.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He is the one,” Melaine said grimly, brushing long strands of red-gold hair from her damp face. “We must try to see that as many of our people as possible survive his coming.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Just as importantly,” Seana said, “we must assure that he survives to fulfill the rest of the prophecy.” Melaine glared at her, and Seana added in a patient tone, “Else none of us will survive.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Rhuarc said he would set some of the Jindo for bodyguards,” Egwene said slowly. “Has he changed his mind?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Amys shook her head. “He has not. Rand al’Thor sleeps in the Jindo tents, with a hundred men awake to see he wakes as well. But men often see things differently than we. Rhuarc will follow him, perhaps oppose him in decisions he thinks are wrong, but he will not try to guide him.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Do you think he needs guiding?” Moiraine arched an eyebrow at that, but Egwene ignored it. “He has done what he had to without guidance so far.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Rand al’Thor does not know our ways,” Amys replied. “There are a hundred mistakes he could make to turn a chief or clan against him, to make them see a wetlander instead of He Who Comes With the Dawn. My husband is a good man and a fine chief, but he is no peacetalker, trained to guide angry men to ground their spears. We must have someone close to Rand al’Thor who can whisper in his ear when he seems ready to step wrongly.” She motioned Aviendha to throw more water on the hot rocks; the younger woman complied with a sullen grace.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“And we must watch him,” Melaine put in sharply. “We must have some idea of what he means to do before he does it. The fulfillment of the Prophecy of Rhuidean has begun—it cannot be halted short of its end, one way or another—but I mean to see that as many of our people survive as is possible. How that can be managed depends on what Rand al’Thor intends.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Bair leaned toward Egwene. She seemed to be all bone and sinew. “You have known him from childhood. Will he confide in you?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I doubt it,” Egwene told her. “He does not trust as he used to.” She avoided looking at Moiraine.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Would she tell us if he did confide?” Melaine demanded. “I raise no anger here, but Egwene and Moiraine are Aes Sedai. What they seek may not be what we seek.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We served Aes Sedai once,” Bair said simply. “We failed them then. Perhaps we are meant to serve again.” Melaine flushed with obvious embarrassment.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine gave no sign that she saw, or that she had heard the woman’s earlier words, for that matter. Except for that tightness around her eyes she looked as calm as ice. “I will help as I can,” she said coolly, “but I have little influence with Rand. For the present, he weaves the Pattern to his own design.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Then we must watch him closely and hope.” Bair sighed. “Aviendha, you will meet Rand al’Thor when he wakes each day and do not leave him until he goes to his blankets at night. You will stay as close to him as the hair on his head. Your training must come as we can manage, I fear; it will be a burden on you, doing both things, but it cannot be avoided. If you talk to him—and especially listen—you should have no trouble remaining near him. Few men will send away a pretty young woman who listens to them. Perhaps he will let something slip.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Aviendha grew stiffer by the word. When Bair finished, she spat, “I will not!” Dead silence fell, and every eye swung to her, but she stared back defiantly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Will not?” Bair said softly. “Will not.” She seemed to be tasting words strange in her mouth.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Aviendha,” Egwene said gently, “no one is asking you to betray Elayne, only to talk to him.” If anything, the former Maiden of the Spear looked even more eager to find herself a weapon.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Is this the discipline Maidens learn now?” Amys said sharply. “If it is, you will find we teach a harder. If there is some reason you cannot stay near to Rand al’Thor, speak it.” Aviendha’s defiance wilted a trifle, and she mumbled inaudibly. Amys’s voice took on a knife edge. “I said, speak it!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I do not like him!” Aviendha burst out. “I hate him! Hate him!” Had Egwene not known better, she would have thought her close to tears. The words shocked her, though; surely Aviendha could not mean it.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We are not asking you to love him, or take him to your bed,” Seana said acidly. “We are <span class="calibre18">telling</span> you to <span class="calibre18">listen</span> to the man, and you will obey!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Childishness!” Amys snorted. “What kind of young women is the world producing now? Do <span class="calibre18">none</span> of you grow up?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Bair and Melaine were even sharper, with the older woman threatening to tie Aviendha on Rand’s horse in place of his saddle—she sounded as if she meant it precisely—and Melaine suggesting that instead of sleep Aviendha should perhaps spend the night digging holes and filling them in to clear her head. The threats were not intended to coerce her, Egwene realized; these women expected and intended to be obeyed. Any useless labor Aviendha earned herself would be for being stubborn. That stubbornness seemed to be shrinking, with four sets of Wise Ones’ eyes boring at her—she settled into more of a defensive crouch, on her knees—but she was holding on.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene leaned over to put a hand on Aviendha’s shoulder. “You’ve told
me we are near-sisters, and I think we are. Will you do it for me? Think of it as looking after him for Elayne. You like her, too, I know. You can tell him she says she meant what she said in her letters. He will like hearing that.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Aviendha’s face spasmed. “I will do it,” she said, slumping. “I will watch him for Elayne. For Elayne.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Amys shook herself. “Foolishness. You will watch him because we told you to, girl. If you think you have another reason, you will find you are painfully mistaken. More water. The steam is fading.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Aviendha hurled another handful onto the rocks as though hurling a spear. Egwene was glad to see her spirit returning, but she thought she would caution her when they were alone. Spirit was all very well, but there were some women—these four Wise Ones, for example, and Siuan Sanche—with whom it was common sense to keep a check on your spirit. You could shout at the Women’s Circle all day, and you still ended up doing what they wanted anyway, wishing you had kept your mouth shut.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Now that that is settled,” Bair said, “let us enjoy the steam in silence while we can. There is much for some of us yet to do tonight, and for nights to come, if we are to bring a gathering to Alcair Dal for Rand al’Thor.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Men always find ways to make work for women,” Amys said. “Why should Rand al’Thor be different?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Quiet settled over the tent except for the hiss when Aviendha tossed more water on the hot rocks. The Wise Ones sat with hands on knees, breathing deeply. It was really quite pleasant, even relaxing, the damp heat, the slick, cleansing feel of sweat on the skin. Egwene thought it was worth missing a little sleep.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine did not look relaxed, though. She stared at the steaming kettle as if seeing something else, far off.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Was it bad?” Egwene said softly so as not to disturb the Wise Ones. “Rhuidean, I mean?” Aviendha looked up quickly, but said nothing.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The memories fade,” Moiraine said, just as quietly. She did not look away from her distant vision, and her voice was almost chill enough to take away the heat in the air. “Most are already gone. Some, I knew already. Others . . . . The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills, and we are only the thread of the Pattern. I have given my life to finding the Dragon Reborn, finding Rand, and seeing him ready to face the Last Battle. I will see that done, whatever it requires. Nothing and no one can be more important than that.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Shivering despite her sweat, Egwene closed her eyes. The Aes Sedai did not want comforting. She was a lump of ice, not a woman. Egwene settled herself to trying to recapture that pleasant feeling. She suspected such would be few and far between in the days to come.</span></div>
