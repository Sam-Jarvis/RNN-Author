<div class="subtitle-chapter"><span class="calibre2"><span class="calibre18">Doorways</span></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="calibre22">“<span class="calibre2">R</span>and al’Thor,” Moiraine told the air in a low, tight voice, “is a mule-headed, stone-willed fool of a . . . a . . . a man!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne lifted her chin angrily. Her childhood nurse, Lini, used to say you could weave silk from pig bristles before you could make a man anything but a man. But that was no excuse for Rand.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We breed them that way in the Two Rivers.” Nynaeve was suddenly all half-suppressed smiles and satisfaction. She seldom hid her dislike of the Aes Sedai half as well as she thought she did. “Two Rivers women never have any trouble with them.” From the startled look Egwene gave her, that was a lie big enough to warrant having her mouth washed out.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine’s brows drew down as if she were about to reply to Nynaeve in harder kind. Elayne stirred, but she could not find anything to say that would head off argument. Rand kept dancing through her head. He had no right! But what right did she have?</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene spoke instead. “What did he do, Moiraine?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Aes Sedai’s eyes swung to Egwene, a stare so hard that the younger woman stepped back and snapped her fan open, nervously fluttering it at her face. But Moiraine’s gaze settled on Joiya and Amico, the one watching her warily, the other bound and unaware of anything but the far wall.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne gave a small start at realizing Joiya was not bound. Hastily she checked the shield blocking the woman from the True Source. She hoped
none of the others had noticed her jump; Joiya frightened her nearly to death, but Egwene and Nynaeve were no more scared of the woman than Moiraine was. Sometimes it was difficult being as brave as the Daughter-Heir of Andor should be; she often found herself wishing she could manage as well as those two.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The guards,” Moiraine muttered as if to herself. “I saw them in the corridor still, and never thought.” She smoothed her dress, composing herself with an obvious effort. Elayne did not believe she had ever seen Moiraine so out of herself as tonight. But then, the Aes Sedai had cause. <span class="calibre18">No more than I do. Or do I?</span> She found herself trying not to meet Egwene’s eyes.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Had it been Egwene or Nynaeve or Elayne who was off balance, Joiya would surely have said something, subtle and of two meanings, calculated to upset them a little more. If they had been alone, at least. With Moiraine, she only watched uneasily, silently.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine walked the length of the table, her calm restored. Joiya was nearly a head the taller, but had she also been dressed in silks, there would have been no doubt which was in command of the situation. Joiya did not quite draw back, but her hands tightened on her skirts for a moment before she could master them.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I have made arrangements,” Moiraine said quietly. “In four days you will be taken upriver by ship, to Tar Valon and the Tower. There they are not so gentle as we have been. If you have not found the truth so far, find it before you reach Southharbor, or you will assuredly go to the gallows in the Traitors’ Court. I will not speak to you again unless you send word that you have something new to tell. And I do not want to hear a word from you—not one word—unless it <span class="calibre18">is</span> new. Believe me, it will save you pain in Tar Valon. Aviendha, will you tell the captain to bring in two of his men?” Elayne blinked as the Aiel woman unfolded herself and vanished through the doorway; sometimes Aviendha could be so still she seemed not to be there.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Joiya’s face worked as if she wanted to speak, but Moiraine stared up at her, and finally the Darkfriend turned her eyes away. They glittered like a raven’s, full of black murder, but she held her tongue.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">To Elayne’s eyes a golden-white glow suddenly surrounded Moiraine, the glow of a woman embracing <span class="calibre18">saidar</span>. Only another woman trained to channel could have seen it. The flows holding Amico unraveled more quickly than Elayne could have managed. She was stronger than Moiraine, potentially, at least. In the Tower, the women teaching her had been almost unbelieving at her potential, and at Egwene’s and Nynaeve’s. Nynaeve was
the strongest of them all—when she could manage to channel. But Moiraine had the experience. What they were still learning to do, Moiraine could do half asleep. Yet there were some things Elayne could do, and the other two, that the Aes Sedai could not. It was a small satisfaction in the face of how easily Moiraine cowed Joiya.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Freed, able to hear, Amico turned and became aware of Moiraine for the first time. With a squeak, she dropped a curtsy as deep as any new novice. Joiya was glaring at the door, avoiding anyone’s gaze. Nynaeve, arms crossed and knuckles white from gripping her braid, was giving Moiraine a stare almost as murderous as Joiya’s. Egwene fingered her skirt and glowered at Joiya; Elayne frowned, wishing she were as brave as Egwene, wishing she did not feel she was betraying her friend. Into that walked the captain with two more Defenders in black and gold on his heels. Aviendha was not with them; it seemed she had taken her opportunity to escape Aes Sedai.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The grizzled officer, two short white plumes on his rimmed helmet, shied as his eyes met Joiya’s, though she did not even seem to see him. His gaze skittered from woman to woman uncertainly. The mood of the room was trouble, and a wise man did not want any part of trouble among this sort of women. The two soldiers clutched their tall spears to their sides almost as if they feared they might have to defend themselves. Perhaps they did fear it.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You will take these two back to their cells,” Moiraine told the officer curtly. “Repeat your instructions. I want no mistakes.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Yes, Ae—” The captain’s throat seemed to seize. He gulped a breath. “Yes, my Lady,” he said, watching her anxiously to see if that would do. When she only continued to look at him, waiting, he gave an audible sigh of relief. “The prisoners are to talk to no one except myself, not even each other. Twenty men in the guardroom and two outside each cell at all times, four if a cell door has to be opened for any reason. I myself will watch their food prepared and take it to them. All as you have commanded, my Lady.” A hint of question tinged his voice. A hundred rumors floated through the Stone concerning the prisoners, and why two women needed to be guarded so heavily. And there were whispered stories about the Aes Sedai, each darker than the last.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Very good,” Moiraine said. “Take them.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">It was not clear who was more eager to leave the room, the prisoners or the guards. Even Joiya stepped quickly, as if she could not bear keeping silent near Moiraine for another moment.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne was certain she had kept her face calm since entering the room, but Egwene came to her, put an arm around her. “What is the matter, Elayne? You look about to cry.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The concern in her voice made Elayne feel like bursting into tears. <span class="calibre18">Light</span>! she thought. <span class="calibre18">I will not be that silly. I will not! “A weeping woman is a bucket with no bottom.”</span> Lini had been full of sayings like that.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Three times—” Nynaeve burst out at Moiraine, “only three!—you have consented to help us question them. This time you vanish before we begin, and now you calmly announce you are sending them off to Tar Valon! If you will not help, at least do not interfere!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Do not presume on the Amyrlin’s authority too far,” Moiraine said coolly. “She may have set you to chase Liandrin, but you are still only Accepted, and woefully ignorant, whatever letters you carry. Or did you mean to keep questioning them forever before reaching a decision? You Two Rivers people seem to work at avoiding decisions that must be made.” Nynaeve opened and closed her mouth, eyes bulging, as if wondering which accusation to answer first, but Moiraine turned to Egwene and Elayne. “Pull yourself together, Elayne. How you can carry out the Amyrlin’s orders if you think every land has the customs you were born to, I do not know. And I do not know why you are so upset. Do not let your feelings hurt others.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What do you mean?” Egwene said. “What customs? What are you talking about?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Berelain was in Rand’s chambers,” Elayne said in a small voice before she could stop herself. Her eyes flickered guiltily toward Egwene. Surely she had kept her own feelings hidden.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine gave her a reproachful look and sighed. “I would have spared you this if I could, Egwene. If Elayne had not let her disgust with Berelain overcome her sense. The customs of Mayene are not those either of you were born to. Egwene, I know what you feel for Rand, but you must realize by now that nothing can come of it. He belongs to the Pattern, and to history.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Seemingly ignoring the Aes Sedai, Egwene peered into Elayne’s eyes. Elayne wanted to look away, and could not. Suddenly Egwene leaned closer, whispering behind a cupped hand. “I love him. Like a brother. And you like a sister. I wish you well of him.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne’s eyes widened, a smile spreading slowly across her face. She answered Egwene’s hug with a fierce hug of her own. “Thank you,” she murmured softly. “I love you too, sister. Oh, thank you.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“She got it wrong,” Egwene said half to herself, a delighted grin blooming on her face. “Have you ever been in love, Moiraine?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">What a startling question. Elayne could not imagine the Aes Sedai in love. Moiraine was Blue Ajah, and it was said Blue sisters gave all their passions to causes.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The slender woman was not at all taken aback. For a long moment she looked levelly at the pair of them, each with an arm around the other. Finally she said, “I could wager I know the face of the man I will marry better than either of you knows that of your future husband.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene gaped in surprise.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Who?” Elayne gasped.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Aes Sedai appeared regretful of having spoken. “Perhaps I only meant we share an ignorance. Do not read too much into a few words.” She looked at Nynaeve consideringly. “Should I ever choose a man—should, I say—it will not be Lan. That much I will say.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">That was a sop to Nynaeve, but Nynaeve did not seem to like hearing it. Nynaeve had what Lini would have called “a hard patch to hoe,” loving not just a Warder but a man who tried to deny returning her love. Fool man that he was, he talked of the war against the Shadow he could not stop fighting and could never win, of refusing to dress Nynaeve in widow’s clothes for her wedding feast. Silly things of that sort. Elayne did not see how Nynaeve put up with it. She was not a very patient woman.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“If you are finished chatting about men,” Nynaeve said acidly, as though to prove just that, “perhaps we can go back to what is important?” Gripping her braid hard, she picked up speed and force as she went along, like a waterwheel with the gears disengaged. “How are we to decide whether Joiya is lying, or Amico, if you send them away? Or whether they both are? Or neither? I don’t relish dithering here, Moiraine, no matter what you think, but I have walked into too many traps to want to walk into another. And I don’t want to run after Jak-o’-the-Wisps, either. I . . . we . . . are the ones the Amyrlin sent after Liandrin and her cronies. Since you don’t seem to think they are important enough to spare more than a moment to help us, the least you can do is not crack our ankles with a broom!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She seemed about to rip that braid free and try to strangle the Aes Sedai with it, and Moiraine wore a dangerously cool crystalline calm that suggested she might be ready to teach again the lesson on holding her tongue that she had taught Joiya. It was, Elayne decided, time for her to stop moping. She did not know how she had fallen into the role of peacemaker
among these women—sometimes she wanted to take them all by the scruff of the neck and shake them—but her mother always said no good decision was ever made in anger. “You might add to your list of what you want to know,” she said, “why were we summoned to Rand? That is where Careen took us. He is all right, now, of course. Moiraine Healed him.” She could not repress a shudder, thinking of her brief glimpse inside his chamber, but the diversion worked a charm.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Healed!” Nynaeve gasped. “What happened to him?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He almost died,” the Aes Sedai said, as calmly as if she were saying he had a pot of tea.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne felt Egwene tremble as they listened to Moiraine’s dispassionate report, but perhaps some of the trembling was her own. Bubbles of evil drifting through the Pattern. Reflections leaping out of mirrors. Rand a mass of blood and wounds. Almost as an afterthought, Moiraine added that she was sure Perrin and Mat had experienced something of the same, but escaped unharmed. The woman must have ice instead of blood. <span class="calibre18">No, she was heated enough about Rand’s stubbornness. And she wasn’t cold when she spoke of marrying, however much she pretended to be</span>. But now she could have been discussing whether a bolt of silk was the right color for a dress.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“And these . . . these <span class="calibre18">things</span> will keep on?” Egwene said when Moiraine finished. “Is there nothing you can do to stop it? Or that Rand can do?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The small blue stone dangling from Moiraine’s hair swung as she shook her head. “Not until he learns to control his abilities. Perhaps not then. I do not know if even he will be strong enough to push the miasma away from himself. At the least, though, he will be better able to defend himself.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Can’t you do something to help him?” Nynaeve demanded. “You are the one of us who is supposed to know everything, or pretends to. Can’t you teach him? Some part of it, anyway? And don’t quote proverbs about birds teaching fish to fly.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You would know better,” Moiraine replied, “if you had taken the advantage of your studies that you should have. You should know better. You want to know how to use the Power, Nynaeve, but you do not care to learn <span class="calibre18">about</span> the Power. <span class="calibre18">Saidin</span> is not <span class="calibre18">saidar</span>. The flows are different, the ways of weaving are different. The bird has a better chance.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">This time Egwene took a turn at diffusing tension. “What is Rand being stubborn about, now?” Nynaeve opened her mouth, and she added, “He can be stubborn as a stone, sometimes.” Nynaeve shut her mouth with a snap; they all knew how true that was.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine eyed them, considering. At times, Elayne was not sure how much the Aes Sedai trusted them. Or anyone. “He must move,” the Aes Sedai said at last. “Instead, he sits here, and the Tairens already begin to lose their fear of him. He sits here, and the longer he sits, doing nothing, the more the Forsaken will see his inaction as a sign of weakness. The Pattern moves and flows; only the dead are still. He must act, or he will die. From a crossbow bolt in his back, or poison in his food, or the Forsaken banding together to rip his soul from his body. He must act or die.” Elayne winced at each danger on her list; that they were real only made it worse.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“And you know what he must do, don’t you?” Nynaeve said tightly. “You have this action planned.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine nodded. “Would you rather he go haring off alone once more? I dare not risk it. This time he might be dead, or worse, before I find him.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">That was true enough. Rand hardly knew what he was doing. And Elayne was sure Moiraine had no wish to lose the little guidance she still gave him. The little he allowed her to give.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Will you share your plan for him with us?” Egwene demanded. She was certainly not helping soothe the air now.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Yes, do,” Elayne said, surprising herself with a cool echo of Egwene’s tone. Confrontation was not her way when it could be avoided; her mother always said it was better to guide people than try to hammer them into line.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">If their manner irritated Moiraine, she gave no sign of it. “As long as you understand that you must keep it to yourselves. A plan revealed is a plan doomed to fail. Yes, I see you do understand.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne certainly did; the plan was dangerous, and Moiraine was not sure it would work.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Sammael is in Illian,” the Aes Sedai went on. “The Tairens are always as ripe for war with Illian as the other way around. They have been killing each other off and on for a thousand years, and they speak of their chance for it as other men speak of the next feastday. I doubt even knowing of Sammael’s presence would change that, not with the Dragon Reborn to lead them. Tear will follow Rand eagerly enough in that enterprise, and if he brings Sammael down, he—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Light!” Nynaeve exclaimed. “You not only want him to start a war, you want him to seek out one of the Forsaken! No wonder he is being stubborn. He is not a fool, for a man.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He must face the Dark One in the end,” Moiraine said calmly. “Do
you truly think he can avoid the Forsaken now? As for war, there are wars enough without him, and every one worse than useless.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Any war is useless,” Elayne began, then faltered as comprehension suddenly filled her. Sadness and regret had to show on her face, too, but certainly comprehension. Her mother had lectured her often on how a nation was led as well as how it was governed, two very different things, but both necessary. And sometimes things had to be done for both that were worse than unpleasant, although the price of not doing them was worse still.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine gave her a sympathetic look. “It is not always pleasant, is it? Your mother began when you were just old enough to understand, I suppose, teaching you what you will need to rule after her.” Moiraine had grown up in the Royal Palace in Cairhien, not destined to reign, but related to the ruling family and no doubt overhearing the same lectures. “Yet sometimes it seems ignorance would be better, to be a farm woman knowing nothing beyond the boundaries of her fields.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“More riddles?” Nynaeve said contemptuously. “War used to be something I heard about from peddlers, something far away that I didn’t really understand. I know what it is, now. Men killing men. Men behaving like animals, reduced to animals. Villages burned, farms and fields burned. Hunger, disease and death, for the innocent as the guilty. What makes this war of yours better, Moiraine? What makes it cleaner?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Elayne?” Moiraine said quietly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She shook her head—she did not want to be the one to explain this—but she was not sure even her mother sitting on the Lion Throne could have kept silent under Moiraine’s compelling, dark-eyed stare. “War will come whether Rand begins it or not,” she said reluctantly. Egwene stepped back a pace, staring at her in disbelief no sharper than that on Nynaeve’s face; the incredulity faded from both women as she continued. “The Forsaken will not stand idly and wait. Sammael cannot be the only one to have seized a nation’s reins, just the lone one we know. They will come after Rand eventually, in their own persons perhaps, but certainly with whatever armies they command. And the nations that are free of the Forsaken? How many will cry glory to the Dragon banner and follow him to Tarmon Gai’don, and how many will convince themselves the fall of the Stone is a lie and Rand only another false Dragon who must be put down, a false Dragon perhaps strong enough to threaten them if they do not move against him first? One way or another, war <span class="calibre18">will</span> come.” She cut off sharply. There was more to it, but she could not, would not, tell them that part.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine was not so reticent. “Very good,” she said, nodding, “yet incomplete.”
The look she gave Elayne said she knew Elayne had left out what she had on purpose. Hands folded calmly at her waist, she addressed Nynaeve and Egwene. “Nothing makes this war better, or cleaner. Except that it will cement the Tairens to him, and the Illianers will end up following him just as the Tairens do now. How could they not, once the Dragon banner flies over Illian? Just the news of his victory might decide the wars in Tarabon and Arad Doman in his favor; there are wars <span class="calibre18">ended</span> for you.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“In one stroke he will make himself so strong in terms of men and swords that only a coalition of every remaining nation from here to the Blight can defeat him, and with the same blow he shows the Forsaken that he is not a plump partridge on a limb for the netting. That will make them wary, and buy him time to learn to use his strength. He must move first, be the hammer, not the nail.” The Aes Sedai grimaced slightly, a hint of her earlier anger marring her calm. “He <span class="calibre18">must</span> move first. And what does he do? He reads. Reads himself into deeper trouble.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nynaeve looked shaken, as if she could see all the battles and death; Egwene’s dark eyes were large with horrified understanding. Their faces made Elayne shiver. One had watched Rand grow up, the other had grown up with him. And now they saw him starting wars. Not the Dragon Reborn, but Rand al’Thor.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene struggled visibly, latching onto the smallest part, the most inconsequential, of what Moiraine had said. “How can reading put him in trouble?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He has decided to find out for himself what the Prophecies of the Dragon say.” Moiraine’s face remained cool and smooth, but suddenly she sounded almost as tired as Elayne felt. “They may have been proscribed in Tear, but the Chief Librarian had nine different translations in a locked chest. Rand has them all, now. I pointed out the verse that applies here, and he quoted it to me, from an old Kandori translation.</span></div>
<br class="calibre8"/><div class="blocktext"><div class="p-br-blocktext"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">“ ‘Power of the Shadow made human flesh,</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">wakened to turmoil, strife and ruin.</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">The Reborn One, marked and bleeding,</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">dances the sword in dreams and mist,</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">chains the Shadowsworn to his will,</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">from the city, lost and forsaken,</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">leads the spears to war once more,</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">breaks the spears and makes them see,</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">truth long hidden in the ancient dream.’ ”</span></span></div></div><br class="calibre8"/>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She grimaced. “It applies to this as well as it does to anything. Illian under Sammael is surely a forsaken city. Lead the Tairen spears to war, chain Sammael, and he has fulfilled the verse. The ancient dream of the Dragon Reborn. But he will not see it. He even has a copy in the Old Tongue, as if he understood two words. He runs after shadows, and Sammael, or Rahvin, or Lanfear may have him by the throat before I can convince him of his mistake.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He is desperate.” Nynaeve’s gentle tone was not for Moiraine, Elayne was sure, but for Rand. “Desperate and trying to find his way.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“So am I desperate,” Moiraine said firmly. “I have dedicated my life to finding him, and I will not let him fail if I can prevent it. I am almost desperate enough to—” She broke off, pursing her lips. “Let it be enough that I will do what I must.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“But it isn’t enough,” Egwene said sharply. “What is it you’ll do?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You have other matters to concern you,” the Aes Sedai said. “The Black Ajah—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“No!’ Elayne’s voice was knife-edged and commanding, her knuckles a hard white where she gripped her soft blue skirts. “You keep many secrets, Moiraine, but tell us this. What do you mean to do to him?” An image flashed in her mind of seizing Moiraine and shaking the truth out of her if need be.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Do to him? Nothing. Oh, very well. There is no reason you should not know. You have seen what the Tairens call the Great Holding?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Oddly for a people that feared the Power so, the Tairens held in the Stone a collection of objects connected to the Power second only to that in the White Tower. Elayne, for one, thought it was because they had been forced to guard <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> so long, whether they wanted or not. Even the Sword That Is Not a Sword might seem less than what it was when it was one among many. But the Tairens had never been able to make themselves display their prizes. The Great Holding was kept in a filthy series of crowded rooms buried even deeper than the dungeons. When Elayne had first seen them the locks on the doors had long since rusted shut, where the doors had not simply collapsed from dry rot.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We spent an entire day down there,” Nynaeve said. “To see if Liandrin and her <span class="calibre18">friends</span> took anything. I don’t think they did. Everything was buried in dust and mold. It will take ten riverboats to transport all of it to the Tower. Perhaps they can make some sense of it there; I surely could not.” The temptation to prod Moiraine was apparently too great to avoid, for she added, “You would know all this if you had given us a little more of your time.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine took no notice. She seemed to be looking inward, examining her own thoughts, and she spoke almost to herself. “There is one particular <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal</span> in the Holding, a thing like a redstone doorframe, subtly twisted to the eye. If I cannot make him reach <span class="calibre18">some</span> decision, I may have to step through.” The small blue stone on her forehead trembled, sparkling. Apparently she was not eager to take that step.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">At the mention of <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal</span>, Egwene instinctively touched the bodice of her dress. She had sewn a small pocket there herself, to hide the stone ring it now held. That ring was a <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal</span>, powerful in its way if small, and Elayne was one of only three women who knew she had it. Moiraine was not one of the three.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">They were strange things, <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal</span>, fragments of the Age of Legends like <span class="calibre18">angreal</span> and <span class="calibre18">sa’angreal</span>, if more numerous. <span class="calibre18">Ter’angreal</span> used the One Power instead of magnifying it. Each had apparently been made to do one thing and one thing alone, but though some were used now, no one was sure if those uses were anything like what they had been made for. The Oath Rod, on which a woman took the Three Oaths on being raised Aes Sedai, was a <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal</span> that made those oaths a part of her flesh and bone. The last test a novice took on being raised to Accepted was inside another <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal</span> that ferreted out her most heartfelt fears and made them seem real—or perhaps took her to a place where they <span class="calibre18">were</span> real. Odd things could happen with <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal</span>. Aes Sedai had been burned out or killed, or had simply vanished, in studying them. And in using them.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I saw that doorway,” Elayne said. “In the last room at the end of the hall. My lamp went out, and I fell three times before I made it to the door.” A slight flush of embarrassment reddened her cheeks. “I was afraid to channel in there, even to relight the lamp. Much of it looks rubbish, to me—I think the Tairens simply grabbed anything that anyone hinted might be connected to the Power—but I thought if I channeled, I might accidentally empower something that wasn’t rubbish, and who knows what it might do.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“And if you had stumbled in the dark and fallen through the twisted doorway?” Moiraine said wryly. “That needs no channeling, only to step through.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“To what purpose?” Nynaeve asked.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“To gain answers. Three answers, each true, about past, present or future.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne’s first thought was for the children’s tale, <span class="calibre18">Bili Under the Hill</span>, but only because of the three answers. A second thought came on its heels, and
not to her alone. She spoke while Nynaeve and Egwene were still opening their mouths. “Moiraine, this solves our problem. We can ask whether Joiya or Amico is telling the truth. We can ask where Liandrin and the others are. The names of the Black Ajah still in the Tower—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We can ask what this thing is that is dangerous to Rand,” Egwene put in, and Nynaeve added, “Why haven’t you told us of this before? Why have you let us go on listening to the same tales day after day when we could have settled it all by now?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Aes Sedai winced and threw up her hands. “You three rush in blindly where Lan and a hundred Warders would tread warily. Why do you think I have not stepped through? Days ago I could have asked what Rand must do to survive and triumph, how he can defeat the Forsaken and the Dark One, how he can learn to control the Power and hold off madness long enough to do what he must.” She waited, hands on hips, while it sank in. None of them spoke. “There are rules,” she went on, “and dangers. No one may step through more than once. Only once. You may ask three questions, but you must ask all three and hear the answers before you may leave. Frivolous questions are punished, it seems, but it also seems what may be serious for one can be frivolous coming from another. Most importantly, questions touching the Shadow have dire consequences.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“If you asked about the Black Ajah, you might be returned dead, or come out a gibbering madwoman, if you came out at all. As for Rand . . . . I am not certain it is possible to ask a question about the Dragon Reborn that does not touch the Shadow in some way. You see? Sometimes there are reasons for caution.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“How do you know all this?” Nynaeve demanded. Planting fists on hips she confronted the Aes Sedai. “The High Lords surely never let Aes Sedai study anything in the Holding. From the filth down there, none of it has seen sunlight in a hundred years or more.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“More, I should think,” Moiraine told her calmly. “They ceased their collecting nearly three hundred years gone. It was just before they stopped completely that they acquired this <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal</span>. Up until then it was the possession of the Firsts of Mayene, who used its answers to help keep Mayene out of Tear’s grasp. And they allowed Aes Sedai to study it. In secret, of course; Mayene has never dared anger Tear too openly.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“If it was so important to Mayene,” Nynaeve said suspiciously, “why is it here, in the Stone?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Because Firsts have made bad decisions as well as good in trying to keep Mayene free of Tear. Three hundred years ago the High Lords were
planning to build a fleet to follow Mayener ships and find the oilfish shoals. Halvar, the then First, raised the price of Mayener lamp oil well above that of oil from Tear’s olives, and to further convince the High Lords that Mayene would always put its own interests behind those of Tear, made them a gift of the <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal</span>. He had already used it, so it was no further good to him, and he was almost as young as Berelain is now, apparently with a long reign ahead of him and many years of needing Tairen goodwill.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He was a fool,” Elayne muttered. “My mother would never make such a mistake.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Perhaps not,” Moiraine said. “But then, Andor is not a small nation cornered by a much larger and stronger. Halvar <span class="calibre18">was</span> a fool as it turned out—the High Lords had him assassinated the very next year—but his foolishness does present me with an opportunity, if I need it. A dangerous one, yet better than none.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nynaeve muttered to herself, perhaps disappointed that the Aes Sedai had not tripped herself up.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It leaves the rest of us right where we were.” Egwene sighed. “Not knowing who is lying, or whether they both are.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Question them again, if you wish,” Moiraine said. “You have until they are put on the ship, though I very much doubt either will change her tale now. My advice is to concentrate on Tanchico. If Joiya speaks truly, it will take Aes Sedai and Warders to guard Mazrim Taim, not just the three of you. I sent a warning to the Amyrlin by pigeon when I first heard Joiya’s story. In fact, I sent three pigeons, to make sure one reaches the Tower.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“So kind of you to keep us informed,” Elayne murmured coolly. The woman did go her own way. Just because they were only pretending to be full Aes Sedai was no reason for Moiraine to keep them in the dark. The Amyrlin had sent <span class="calibre18">them</span> out to hunt the Black Ajah.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine inclined her head briefly, as if accepting the thanks for real. “You are welcome. Remember that you are the hounds the Amyrlin set after the Black Ajah.” Her slight smile at Elayne’s start said she knew exactly what Elayne had been thinking. “The decision on where to course must be yours. You have pointed that out to me, as well,” she added drily. “I trust it will prove an easier decision than mine. And I trust you will sleep well, what sleep is left before daybreak. A good night to you.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“That woman . . .” Elayne muttered when the door had closed behind the Aes Sedai. “Sometimes I could almost strangle her.” She dropped into one of the chairs at the table and sat frowning at her hands in her lap.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nynaeve gave a grunt that might have been agreement as she went to
a narrow table against the wall where silver goblets and spice jars stood next to two pitchers. One pitcher, full of wine, rested in a gleaming bowl of now mostly melted ice, brought all the way from the Spine of the World packed in chests of sawdust. Ice in the summer to chill a High Lord’s drink; Elayne could barely imagine such a thing.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“A cool drink before bed will do us all good,” Nynaeve said, busying herself with wine and water and spices.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne lifted her head as Egwene took a seat next to her. “Did you mean what you said, Egwene? About Rand?” Egwene nodded, and Elayne sighed. “Do you remember what Min used to say, all her jokes about sharing him? I sometimes wondered if that was a viewing she did not tell us about. I thought she meant we both loved him, and she knew it. But you had the right to him, and I didn’t know what to do. I still don’t. Egwene, he loves you.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He will just have to be put straight,” Egwene said firmly. “When I marry, it will be because I want to, not just because a man expects me to love him. I will be gentle with him, Elayne, but before I am done, he will know he is free. Whether he wants to be or not. My mother says men are different from us. She says we want to be in love, but only with the one we want; a man needs to be in love, but he will love the first woman to tie a string to his heart.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“That is all very well,” Elayne said in a tight voice, “but Berelain was in his chambers.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene sniffed. “Whatever she intends, Berelain won’t keep her mind on one man long enough to make him love her. Two days ago she was casting eyes at Rhuarc. In two more, she’ll be smiling at someone else. She is like Else Grinwell. You remember her? The novice who spent all her time out at the practice yards fluttering her eyelashes at the Warders?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“She was not just fluttering her eyelashes, in his bedchamber at this hour. She was wearing even less than usual, if that is possible!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Do you mean to let her have him, then?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“No!” Elayne said it very fiercely, and she meant it, but in the next breath she was full of despair. “Oh, Egwene, I do not know what to do. I love him. I want to marry him. Light! What will mother say? I would rather spend a night in Joiya’s cell than listen to the lectures mother will give me.” Andoran nobles, even in royal families, married commoners often enough that it hardly occasioned comment—in Andor, at least—but Rand was not exactly the usual run of commoner. Her mother was quite capable of actually sending Lini to drag her home by her ear.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Morgase can hardly say much if Mat is to be believed,” Egwene said comfortingly. “Or even half believed. This Lord Gaebril your mother is mooning after hardly sounds the choice of a woman thinking with her head.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I am sure Mat exaggerated,” Elayne replied primly. Her mother was too shrewd to make herself a fool over any man. If Lord Gaebril—she had never even heard of him before Mat spoke his name—if this fellow dreamed he could gain power through Morgase, she would give him a rude awakening.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nynaeve brought three goblets of spiced wine to the table, beads of condensation running down their shining sides, and small green-and-gold woven straw mats to put them on so the damp would not mar the table’s polish. “So,” she said, taking a chair, “you’ve discovered you are in love with Rand, Elayne, and Egwene has discovered she isn’t.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The two younger women gaped at her, one dark, the other fair, yet a near mirror image of astonishment.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I have eyes,” Nynaeve said complacently. “And ears, when you don’t take the trouble to whisper.” She sipped at her wine, and her voice grew cold when she continued. “What do you mean to do about it? If that chit Berelain has her claws into him, it will not be easy to pry them loose. Are you sure you want to go to the effort? You know what he is. You know what lies ahead of him, even setting the Prophecies aside. Madness. Death. How long does he have? A year? Two? Or will it begin before summer’s end? He is a man who can channel.” She bit off each word in tones of iron. “Remember what you were taught. Remember what he is.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne held her head high and met Nynaeve stare for stare. “It does not matter. Perhaps it should, but it doesn’t. Perhaps I am being foolish. I do not care. I cannot change my heart to order, Nynaeve.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Suddenly Nynaeve smiled. “I had to be sure,” she said warmly. “You must be sure. It isn’t easy loving any man, but loving this man will be harder yet.” Her smile faded as she went on. “My first question still has to be answered. What do you mean to do about it? Berelain may look soft—she certainly makes men see her so!—but I do not think she is. She will fight for what she wants. And she’s the kind to hold hard to something she doesn’t particularly want, just because someone else does want it.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I would like to stuff her in a barrel,” Egwene said, gripping her goblet as if it were the First’s throat, “and ship her back to Mayene. In the bottom of the hold.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nynaeve’s braid swung as she shook her head. “All very well, but try to
offer advice that helps. If you cannot, keep silent and let her decide what she must do.” Egwene stared at her, and she added, “Rand is Elayne’s to deal with, now, not yours. You have stepped aside, remember.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The remark should have made Elayne smile, but it did not. “This was all supposed to be different.” She sighed. “I thought I would meet a man, learn to know him over months or years, and slowly I would come to realize I loved him. That is the way I always thought it would be. I hardly know Rand. I’ve talked with him no more than half a dozen times in the space of a year. But I knew I loved him five minutes after I first set eyes on him.” Now that <span class="calibre18">was</span> foolish. Only, it was true, and she did not care if it was foolish. She would tell her mother the same to her face, and Lini. Well, perhaps not Lini. Lini had drastic ways of dealing with foolishness, and she seemed to think Elayne had not aged beyond ten. “As matters stand, though, I don’t even have the right to be angry with him. Or Berelain.” But she was. <span class="calibre18">I would like to slap his face till his ears ring for a year! I’d like to switch her all the way to the ship that takes her back to Mayene!</span> Only, she did <span class="calibre18">not</span> have the right, and that made it all the worse. Infuriatingly, a plaintive tone touched her voice. “What can I do? He has never looked at me twice.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“In the Two Rivers,” Egwene said slowly, “if a woman wants a man to know she is interested in him, she puts flowers in his hair at Bel Time or Sunday. Or she might embroider a feastday shirt for him any time. Or make a point of asking him to dance and no one else.” Elayne gave her an incredulous look, and she hastened to add, “I am not suggesting you embroider a shirt, but there are ways to let him know how you feel.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Mayeners believe in speaking out.” Elayne’s voice held a brittle edge. “Perhaps that is the best way. Just tell him right out. At least he’ll know how I feel, then. At least I’ll have some right to—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She snatched her spiced wine and tilted her head back, drinking. Speak out? Like some <span class="calibre18">Mayener</span> hussy! Setting the empty goblet back on the small mat, she drew a deep breath and murmured, “What <span class="calibre18">will</span> Mother say?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What’s more important,” Nynaeve said gently, “is what you will do when we have to leave here. Whether it’s Tanchico, or the Tower, or somewhere else, we will have to go. What will you do when you’ve just told him you love him, and you must leave him behind? If he asks you to stay with him? If you want to?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I will go.” There was no hesitation in Elayne’s reply, but a touch of asperity. The other woman should not have had to ask. “If I must accept him being the Dragon Reborn, he must accept that I am what I am, that I have duties. I want to be Aes Sedai, Nynaeve. It isn’t some idle amusement.
Neither is the work we three have to do. Could you really think I would abandon you and Egwene?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene hurried to assure her that the thought had never crossed her mind; Nynaeve did the same, but slowly enough to give herself the lie.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne looked from one to the other of them. “In truth, I feared you might tell me I was foolish, fretting over a thing like this when we have the Black Ajah to worry about.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">A slight flicker of Egwene’s eyes said the thought had occurred to her, but Nynaeve said, “Rand is not the only one who might die next year, or next month, We might, too. Times are not what they were, and we cannot be, either. If you sit and wish for what you want, you may not see it this side of the grave.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">It was a chilling sort of reassurance, but Elayne nodded. She was <span class="calibre18">not</span> being silly. If only the Black Ajah could be settled so easily. She pressed her empty silver goblet to her forehead for the coolness. What were they to do?</span></div>
