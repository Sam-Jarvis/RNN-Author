<p class="chapterOpenerText">Shallan’s fears were confirmed as Jasnah looked straight at her, then lowered her safehand to her side in a mark of frustration. “So you <span class="italic1">are</span> here.”</p>
<p class="para">Shallan cringed. “The servants told you, then?”</p>
<p class="para">“You didn’t think that they would leave someone in my alcove and not warn me?” Behind Jasnah, a small group of parshmen hesitated in the hallway, each carrying an armload of books.</p>
<p class="para">“Brightness Kholin,” Shallan said. “I just—”</p>
<p class="para">“I have wasted enough time on you already,” Jasnah said, eyes furious. “You will withdraw, Miss Davar. And I will not see you again during my time here. Am I <span class="italic1">understood</span>?”</p>
<p class="para">Shallan’s hopes crumbled. She shrank back. There was a gravity to Jasnah Kholin. One did not disobey her. One need only look into those eyes to understand.</p>
<p class="para">“I’m sorry to have bothered you,” Shallan whispered, clutching her satchel and leaving with as much dignity as she could manage. She barely kept the tears of embarrassment and disappointment from her eyes as she hastened down the hallway, feeling like a complete fool.</p>
<p class="para">She reached the porter’s shaft, though they had already returned below after bringing up Jasnah. Shallan didn’t pull the bell to summon them. Instead she placed her back to the wall and sank down to the floor, knees up against her chest, satchel in her lap. She wrapped her arms around her legs, freehand clasping her safehand through the fabric of her cuff, breathing quietly.</p>
<p class="para">Angry people unsettled her. She couldn’t help but think of her father in one of his tirades, couldn’t help but hear screams, bellows, and whimpers. Was she weak because confrontation unsettled her so? She felt that she was.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Foolish, idiot girl,</span> she thought, a few painspren crawling out of the wall near her head. <span class="italic1">What made you think you could do this? You’ve only set foot off your family grounds a half-dozen times during your life. Idiot, idiot,</span> idiot!</p>
<p class="para">She had persuaded her brothers to trust her, to put hope in her ridiculous plan. And now what had she done? Wasted six months during which their enemies circled closer.</p>
<p class="para">“Brightness Davar?” asked a hesitant voice.</p>
<p class="para">Shallan looked up, realizing she’d been so wrapped in her misery that she hadn’t seen the servant approach. He was a younger man, wearing an all black uniform, no emblem on the breast. Not a master-servant, but perhaps one in training.</p>
<p class="para">“Brightness Kholin would like to speak with you.” The young man gestured back down the hallway.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">To berate me further?</span> Shallan thought with a grimace. But a highlady like Jasnah got what she wanted. Shallan forced herself to stop shaking, then stood. At least she’d been able to keep the tears away; she hadn’t ruined her makeup. She followed the servant back to the lit alcove, satchel clutched before her like a shield on the battlefield.</p>
<p class="para">Jasnah Kholin sat in the chair Shallan had been using, stacks of books on the table. Jasnah was rubbing her forehead with her freehand. The Soulcaster rested against the back of her skin, the smokestone dark and cracked. Though Jasnah looked fatigued, she sat with perfect posture, her fine silk dress covering her feet, her safehand held across her lap.</p>
<p class="para">Jasnah focused on Shallan, lowering her freehand. “I should not have treated you with such anger, Miss Davar,” she said in a tired voice. “You were simply showing persistence, a trait I normally encourage. Storms alight, I’ve oft been guilty of stubbornness myself. Sometimes we find it hardest to accept in others that which we cling to in ourselves. My only excuse can be that I have put myself under an unusual amount of strain lately.”</p>
<p class="para">Shallan nodded in gratitude, though she felt terribly awkward.</p>
<p class="para">Jasnah turned to look out of the balcony into the dark space of the Veil. “I know what people say of me. I should hope that I am not as harsh as some say, though a woman could have far worse than a reputation for sternness. It can serve one well.”</p>
<p class="para">Shallan had to forcibly keep herself from fidgeting. Should she withdraw?</p>
<p class="para">Jasnah shook her head to herself, though Shallan could not guess what thoughts had caused the unconscious gesture. Finally, she turned back to Shallan and waved toward the large, gobletlike bowl on the desk. It held a dozen of Shallan’s spheres.</p>
<p class="para">Shallan raised her freehand to her lips in shock. She’d completely forgotten the money. She bowed to Jasnah in thanks, then hurriedly collected the spheres. “Brightness, lest I forget, I should mention that an ardent—Brother Kabsal—came to see you while I waited here. He wished me to pass on his desire to speak with you.”</p>
<p class="para">“Not surprising,” Jasnah said. “You seem surprised about the spheres, Miss Davar. I assumed that you were waiting outside to recover them. Is that not why you were so close?”</p>
<p class="para">“No, Brightness. I was just settling my nerves.”</p>
<p class="para">“Ah.”</p>
<p class="para">Shallan bit her lip. The princess appeared to have gotten past her initial tirade. Perhaps…“Brightness,” Shallan said, cringing at her brashness, “what did you think of my letter?”</p>
<p class="para">“Letter?”</p>
<p class="para">“I…” Shallan glanced at the desk. “Beneath that stack of books, Brightness.”</p>
<p class="para">A servant quickly moved aside the stack of books; the parshman must have set it on the paper without noticing. Jasnah picked up the letter, raising an eyebrow, and Shallan hurriedly undid her satchel and placed the spheres in her money pouch. Then she cursed herself for being so quick, as now she had nothing to do but stand and wait for Jasnah to finish reading.</p>
<p class="para">“This is true?” Jasnah looking up from the paper. “You are self-trained?”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, Brightness.”</p>
<p class="para">“That is remarkable.”</p>
<p class="para">“Thank you, Brightness.”</p>
<p class="para">“And this letter was a clever maneuver. You correctly assumed that I would respond to a written plea. This shows me your skill with words, and the rhetoric of the letter gives proof that you can think logically and make a good argument.”</p>
<p class="para">“Thank you, Brightness,” Shallan said, feeling another surge of hope, mixed with fatigue. Her emotions had been jerked back and forth like a rope being used for a tugging contest.</p>
<p class="para">“You should have left the note for me, and withdrawn before I returned.”</p>
<p class="para">“But then the note would have been lost beneath that stack of books.”</p>

<p class="para">Jasnah raised an eyebrow at her, as if to show that she did not appreciate being corrected. “Very well. The context of a person’s life <span class="italic1">is</span> important. Your circumstances do not excuse your lack of education in history and philosophy, but leniency is in order. I will allow you to petition me again at a later date, a privilege I have never given any aspiring ward. Once you have a sufficient groundwork in those two subjects, come to me again. If you have improved suitably, I will accept you.”</p>
<p class="para">Shallan’s emotions sank. Jasnah’s offer <span class="italic1">was</span> kindly, but it would take years of study to accomplish what she asked. House Davar would have fallen by then, her family’s lands divided among its creditors, her brothers and herself stripped of title and perhaps enslaved.</p>
<p class="para">“Thank you, Brightness,” Shallan said, bowing her head.</p>
<p class="para">Jasnah nodded, as if considering the matter closed. Shallan withdrew, walking quietly down the hallway and pulling the cord to ring for the porters.</p>
<p class="para">Jasnah had all but promised to accept her at a later date. For most, that would be a great victory. Being trained by Jasnah Kholin—thought by some to be the finest living scholar—would have ensured a bright future. Shallan would have married extremely well, likely to the son of a highprince, and would have found new social circles open to her. Indeed, if Shallan had possessed the time to train under Jasnah, the sheer prestige of a Kholin affiliation might have been enough to save her house.</p>
<p class="para">If only.</p>
<p class="para">Eventually, Shallan made her way out of the Conclave; there were no gates on the front, just pillars set before the open maw. She was surprised to discover how dim it was outside. She trailed down the large steps, then took a smaller, more cultivated side path where she would be out of the way. Small shelves of ornamental shalebark had been grown along this walkway, and several species had let out fanlike tendrils to wave in the evening breeze. A few lazy lifespren—like specks of glowing green dust—flitted from one frond to the next.</p>
<p class="para">Shallan leaned back against the stonelike plant, the tendrils pulling in and hiding. From this vantage, she could look down at Kharbranth, lights glowing beneath her like a cascade of fire streaming down the cliff face. The only other option for her and her brothers was to run. To abandon the family estates in Jah Keved and seek asylum. But where? Were there old allies her father <span class="italic1">hadn’t</span> alienated?</p>
<p class="para">There was that matter of the strange collection of maps they’d found in his study. What did they mean? He’d rarely spoken of his plans to his children. Even her father’s advisors knew very little. Helaran—her eldest brother—had known more, but he had vanished over a year ago, and her father had proclaimed him dead.</p>

<p class="para">As always, thinking of her father made her feel ill, and the pain started to constrict her chest. She raised her freehand to her head, suddenly overwhelmed by the weight of House Davar’s situation, her part in it, and the secret she now carried, hidden ten heartbeats away.</p>
<p class="para">“Ho, young miss!” a voice called. She turned, shocked to see Yalb standing up on a rocky shelf a short distance from the Conclave entrance. A group of men in guard uniforms sat on the rock around him.</p>
<p class="para">“Yalb?” she said, aghast. He should have returned to his ship hours ago. She hurried over to stand below the short stone outcropping. “Why are you still here?”</p>
<p class="para">“Oh,” he said, grinning, “I found myself a game of kabers here with these fine, upstanding gentlemen of the city guard. Figured officers of the law were right unlikely to cheat me, so we entered into a friendly-type game while I waited.”</p>
<p class="para">“But you didn’t <span class="italic1">need</span> to wait.”</p>
<p class="para">“Didn’t need to win eighty chips off these fellows neither,” Yalb said with a laugh. “But I did both!”</p>
<p class="para">The men sitting around him looked far less enthusiastic. Their uniforms were orange tabards tied about the middle with white sashes.</p>
<p class="para">“Well, I suppose I should be leading you back to the ship, then,” Yalb said, reluctantly gathering up the spheres in the pile at his feet. They glowed with a variety of hues. Their light was small—each was only a chip—but it was impressive winnings.</p>
<p class="para">Shallan stepped back as Yalb hopped off the rock shelf. His companions protested his departure, but he gestured to Shallan. “You’d have me leave a lighteyed woman of her stature to walk back to the ship on her own? I figured you for men of honor!”</p>
<p class="para">That quieted their protests.</p>
<p class="para">Yalb chuckled to himself, bowing to Shallan and leading her away down the path. He had a twinkle to his eyes. “Stormfather, but it’s fun to win against lawmen. I’ll have free drinks at the docks once this gets around.”</p>
<p class="para">“You shouldn’t gamble,” Shallan said. “You shouldn’t try to guess the future. I didn’t give you that sphere so you could waste it on such practices.”</p>
<p class="para">Yalb laughed. “It ain’t gambling if you know you’re going to win, young miss.”</p>
<p class="para">“You <span class="italic1">cheated</span>?” she hissed, horrified. She glanced back at the guardsmen, who had settled down to continue their game, lit by the spheres on the stones before them.</p>
<p class="para">“Not so loud!” Yalb said in a low voice. However, he seemed very pleased with himself. “Cheating four guardsmen, now that’s a trick. Hardly believe I managed it!”</p>
<p class="para">“I’m disappointed in you. This is <span class="italic1">not</span> proper behavior.”</p>

<p class="para">“It is if you’re a sailor, young miss.” He shrugged. “It’s what they right expected from me. Watched me like handlers of poisonous skyeels, they did. The game wasn’t about the cards—it was about them trying to figure how I was cheating and me trying to figure how to keep them from hauling me off. I think I might not have managed to walk away with my skin if you hadn’t arrived!” That didn’t seem to worry him much.</p>
<p class="para">The roadway down to the docks was not nearly as busy as it had been earlier, but there were still a surprisingly large number of people about. The street was lit by oil lanterns—spheres would just have ended up in someone’s pouch—but many of the people about carried sphere lanterns, casting a rainbow of colored light on the roadway. The people were almost like spren, each a different hue, moving this way or that.</p>
<p class="para">“So, young miss,” Yalb said, leading her carefully through the traffic. “You really want to go back? I just said what I did so I could extract myself from that game there.”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, I do want to go back, please.”</p>
<p class="para">“And your princess?”</p>
<p class="para">Shallan grimaced. “The meeting was…unproductive.”</p>
<p class="para">“She didn’t take you? What’s wrong with her?”</p>
<p class="para">“Chronic competence, I should guess. She’s been so successful in life that she has unrealistic expectations of others.”</p>
<p class="para">Yalb frowned, guiding Shallan around a group of revelers stumbling drunkenly up the roadway. Wasn’t it a little early for that sort of thing? Yalb got a few steps ahead, turning and walking backward, looking at her. “That doesn’t make sense, young miss. What more could she want than you?”</p>
<p class="para">“Much more, apparently.”</p>
<p class="para">“But you’re perfect! Pardon my forwardness.”</p>
<p class="para">“You’re walking backward.”</p>
<p class="para">“Pardon my backwardness, then. You look good from any side, young miss, that you do.”</p>
<p class="para">She found herself smiling. Tozbek’s sailors had far too high an opinion of her.</p>
<p class="para">“You’d make an ideal ward,” he continued. “Genteel, pretty, refined and such. Don’t much like your opinion on gambling, but that’s to be expected. Wouldn’t be right for a proper woman not to scold a fellow for gambling. It’d be like the sun refusing to rise or the sea turning white.”</p>
<p class="para">“Or Jasnah Kholin smiling.”</p>
<p class="para">“Exactly! Anyway, you’re perfect.”</p>
<p class="para">“It’s kind of you to say so.”</p>
<p class="para">“Well, it’s true,” he said, putting hands on hips, stopping. “So that’s it? You’re going to give up?”</p>
<p class="para">She gave him a perplexed stare. He stood there on the busy roadway, lit from above by a lantern burning yellow-orange, hands on his hips, white Thaylen eyebrows drooping along the sides of his face, bare-chested under his open vest. That was a posture no citizen, no matter how high ranked, had ever taken at her father’s mansion.</p>
<p class="para">“I <span class="italic1">did</span> try to persuade her,” Shallan said, blushing. “I went to her a second time, and she rejected me again.”</p>
<p class="para">“Two times, eh? In cards, you always got to try a third hand. It wins the most often.”</p>
<p class="para">Shallan frowned. “But that’s not really true. The laws of probability and statistics—”</p>
<p class="para">“Don’t know much blustering math,” Yalb said, folding his arms. “But I do know the Passions. You win when you need it most, you see.”</p>
<p class="para">The Passions. Pagan superstition. Of course, Jasnah had referred to glyphwards as superstition too, so perhaps it all came down to perspective.</p>
<p class="para">Try a third time…Shallan shivered to consider Jasnah’s wrath if Shallan bothered her yet again. She’d surely withdraw the offer to come study with her in the future.</p>
<p class="para">But Shallan would never get to take that offer. It was like a glass sphere with no gemstone at the center. Pretty, but worthless. Was it not better to take one last chance at getting the position she needed <span class="italic1">now</span>?</p>
<p class="para">It wouldn’t work. Jasnah had made it quite clear that Shallan was not yet educated enough.</p>
<p class="para">Not yet educated enough…</p>
<p class="para">An idea sparked in Shallan’s head. She raised her safehand to her breast, standing on that roadway, considering the audacity of it. She’d likely get herself thrown from the city at Jasnah’s demand.</p>
<p class="para">Yet if she returned home without trying every avenue, could she face her brothers? They depended on her. For once in her life, someone <span class="italic1">needed</span> Shallan. That responsibility excited her. And terrified her.</p>
<p class="para">“I need a book merchant,” she found herself saying, voice wavering slightly.</p>
<p class="para">Yalb raised an eyebrow at her.</p>
<p class="para">“Third hand wins the most. Do you think you can find me a book merchant who is open at this hour?”</p>
<p class="para">“Kharbranth is a major port, young miss,” he said with a laugh. “Stores stay open late. Just wait here.” He dashed off into the evening crowd, leaving her with an anxious protest on her lips.</p>
<p class="para">She sighed, then seated herself in a demure posture on the stone base of a lantern pole. It should be safe. She saw other lighteyed women passing on the street, though they were often carried in palanquins or those small, hand-pulled vehicles. She even saw the occasional real carriage, though only the very wealthy could afford to keep horses.</p>

<p class="para">A few minutes later, Yalb popped out of the crowd as if from nowhere and waved for her to follow. She rose and hurried to him.</p>
<p class="para">“Should we get a porter?” she asked as he led her to a large side street that ran laterally across the city’s hill. She stepped carefully; her skirt was long enough that she worried about tearing the hem on the stone. The strip at the bottom was designed to be easily replaced, but Shallan could hardly afford to waste spheres on such things.</p>
<p class="para">“Nah,” Yalb said. “It’s right here.” He pointed along another cross street. This one had a row of shops climbing up the steep slope, each with a sign hanging out front bearing the glyphpair for <span class="italic1">book</span>, and those glyphs were often styled into the shape of a book. Illiterate servants who might be sent to a shop had to be able to recognize them.</p>
<p class="para">“Merchants of the same type like to clump together,” Yalb said, rubbing his chin. “Seems dumb to me, but I guess merchants are like fish. Where you find one, you’ll find others.”</p>
<p class="para">“The same could be said of ideas,” Shallan said, counting. Six different shops. All were lit with Stormlight in the windows, cool and even.</p>
<p class="para">“Third one on the left,” Yalb said, pointing. “Merchant’s name is Artmyrn. My sources say he’s the best.” It was a Thaylen name. Likely Yalb had asked others from his homeland, and they had pointed him here.</p>
<p class="para">She nodded to Yalb and they climbed up the steep stone street to the shop. Yalb didn’t enter with her; she’d noticed that many men were uncomfortable around books and reading, even those who weren’t Vorin.</p>
<p class="para">She pushed through the door—stout wood set with two crystal panels—and stepped into a warm room, uncertain what to expect. She’d never gone into a store to purchase anything; she’d either sent servants, or the merchants had come to her.</p>
<p class="para">The room inside looked very inviting, with large, comfortable easy chairs beside a hearth. Flamespren danced on burning logs there, and the floor was wood. Seamless wood; it had probably been Soulcast that way directly from the stone beneath. Lavish indeed.</p>
<p class="para">A woman stood behind a counter at the back of the room. She wore an embroidered skirt and blouse, rather than the sleek, silk, one-piece havah that Shallan wore. She was darkeyed, but she was obviously affluent. In Vorin kingdoms, she’d likely be of the first or second nahn. Thaylens had their own system of ranks. At least they weren’t completely pagan—they respected eye color, and the woman wore a glove on her safehand.</p>
<p class="para">There weren’t many books in the place. A few on the counter, one on a stand beside the chairs. A clock ticked on the wall, its underside hung with a dozen shimmering silver bells. This looked more like a person’s home than a shop.</p>
<p class="para">The woman slid a marker into her book, smiling at Shallan. It was a smooth, eager smile. Almost predatory. “Please, Brightness, sit,” she said, waving toward the chairs. The woman had curled her long, white Thaylen eyebrows so they hung down the sides of her face like locks from her bangs.</p>
<p class="para">Shallan sat hesitantly as the woman rang a bell on the underside of the counter. Soon, a portly man waddled into the room wearing a vest that seemed ready to burst from the stress of holding in his girth. His hair was greying, and he kept his eyebrows combed back, over his ears.</p>
<p class="para">“Ah,” he said, clapping ample hands, “dear young woman. Are you in the market for a nice novel? Some leisure reading to pass the cruel hours while you are separated from a lost love? Or perhaps a book on geography, with details of exotic locations?” He had a slightly condescending tone and spoke in her native Veden.</p>
<p class="para">“I—No, thank you. I need an extensive set of books on history and three on philosophy.” She thought back, trying to recall the names Jasnah had used. “Something by Placini, Gabrathin, Yustara, Manaline, or Shauka-daughter-Hasweth.”</p>
<p class="para">“Heavy reading for one so young,” the man said, nodding to the woman, who was probably his wife. She ducked into the back room. He’d use her for reading; even if he could read himself, he wouldn’t want to offend customers by doing so in their presence. He would handle the money; commerce was a masculine art in most situations.</p>
<p class="para">“Now, why is a young flower like yourself bothering herself with such topics?” the merchant said, easing himself down into the chair across from her. “Can’t I interest you in a nice romantic novel? They are my specialty, you see. Young women from across the city come to me, and I always carry the best.”</p>
<p class="para">His tone set her on edge. It was galling enough to <span class="italic1">know</span> she was a sheltered child. Was it really necessary to remind her of it? “A romantic novel,” she said, holding her satchel close to her chest. “Yes, perhaps that would be nice. Do you by chance have a copy of <span class="italic1">Nearer the Flame</span>?”</p>
<p class="para">The merchant blinked. <span class="italic1">Nearer the Flame</span> was written from the viewpoint of a man who slowly descended into madness after watching his children starve.</p>
<p class="para">“Are you certain you want something so, er, ambitious?” the man asked.</p>
<p class="para">“Is ambition such an unseemly attribute in a young woman?”</p>
<p class="para">“Well, no, I suppose not.” He smiled again—the thick, toothy smile of a merchant trying to put someone at ease. “I can see you are a woman of discriminating taste.”</p>
<p class="para">“I am,” Shallan said, voice firm though her heart fluttered. Was she destined to get into an argument with everyone she met? “I <span class="italic1">do</span> like my meals prepared very carefully, as my palate is quite delicate.”</p>
<p class="para">“Pardon. I meant that you have discriminating taste <span class="italic1">in books</span>.”</p>

<p class="para">“I’ve never eaten one, actually.”</p>
<p class="para">“Brightness, I believe you are having sport with me.”</p>
<p class="para">“Not yet I’m not. I haven’t even really begun.”</p>
<p class="para">“I—”</p>
<p class="para">“Now,” she said, “you were right to compare the mind and the stomach.”</p>
<p class="para">“But—”</p>
<p class="para">“Too many of us,” she said, “take great pains with what we ingest through our mouths, and far less with what we partake of through our ears and eyes. Wouldn’t you say?”</p>
<p class="para">He nodded, perhaps not trusting her to let him speak without interrupting. Shallan knew, somewhere in the back of her mind, that she was letting herself go too far—that she was tense and frustrated after her interactions with Jasnah.</p>
<p class="para">She didn’t care at the moment. “Discriminating,” she said, testing the world. “I’m not certain I agree with your choice of words. To discriminate is to maintain prejudice against. To be exclusive. Can a person afford to be exclusive with what they ingest? Whether we speak of food or of thoughts?”</p>
<p class="para">“I think they must be,” the merchant said. “Isn’t that what you just said?”</p>
<p class="para">“I said we should take thought for what we read or eat. Not that we should be exclusive. Tell me, what do you think would happen to a person who ate only sweets?”</p>
<p class="para">“I know well,” the man said. “I have a sister-in-law who periodically upsets her stomach by doing that.”</p>
<p class="para">“See, she was <span class="italic1">too</span> discriminating. The body needs many different foods to remain healthy. And the mind needs many different ideas to remain sharp. Wouldn’t you agree? And so if I were to read only these silly romances you presume that my ambition can handle, my mind would grow sick as surely as your sister-in-law’s stomach. Yes, I should think that the metaphor is a solid one. You are quite clever, Master Artmyrn.”</p>
<p class="para">His smile returned.</p>
<p class="para">“Of course,” she noted, not smiling back, “being talked down to upsets both the mind <span class="italic1">and</span> the stomach. So nice of you to give a poignant object lesson to accompany your brilliant metaphor. Do you treat all of your customers this way?”</p>
<p class="para">“Brightness…I believe you stray into sarcasm.”</p>
<p class="para">“Funny. I thought I’d run straight into it, screaming at the top of my lungs.”</p>
<p class="para">He blushed and stood. “I’ll go help my wife.” He hurriedly withdrew.</p>
<p class="para">She sat back, and realized she was annoyed at herself for letting her frustration boil out. It was just what her nurses had warned her about. A young woman had to mind her words. Her father’s intemperate tongue had earned their house a regrettable reputation; would she add to it?</p>

<p class="para">She calmed herself, enjoying the warmth and watching the dancing flamespren until the merchant and his wife returned, bearing several stacks of books. The merchant took his seat again, and his wife pulled over a stool, setting the tomes on the floor and then showing them one at a time as her husband spoke.</p>
<p class="para">“For history, we have two choices,” the merchant said, condescension—and friendliness—gone. “<span class="italic1">Times and Passage,</span> by Rencalt, is a single volume survey of Rosharan history since the Hierocracy.” His wife held up a red, cloth-bound volume. “I told my wife that you would likely be insulted by such a shallow option, but she insisted.”</p>
<p class="para">“Thank you,” Shallan said. “I am not insulted, but I do require something more detailed.”</p>
<p class="para">“Then perhaps <span class="italic1">Eternathis</span> will serve you,” he said as his wife held up a blue-grey set of four volumes. “It is a philosophical work which examines the same time period by focusing only on the interactions of the five Vorin kingdoms. As you can see, the treatment is exhaustive.”</p>
<p class="para">The four volumes were thick. The <span class="italic1">five</span> Vorin kingdoms? She’d thought there were four. Jah Keved, Alethkar, Kharbranth, and Natanatan. United by religion, they had been strong allies during the years following the Recreance. What was the fifth kingdom?</p>
<p class="para">The volumes intrigued her. “I will take them.”</p>
<p class="para">“Excellent,” the merchant said, a bit of the gleam returning to his eye. “Of the philosophical works you listed, we didn’t have anything by Yustara. We have one each of works by Placini and Manaline; both are collections of excerpts from their most famous writings. I’ve had the Placini book read to me; it’s quite good.”</p>
<p class="para">Shallan nodded.</p>
<p class="para">“As for Gabrathin,” he said, “we have four different volumes. My, but he was a prolific one! Oh, and we have a single book by Shauka-daughter-Hasweth.” The wife held up a thin green volume. “I have to admit, I’ve never had any of her work read to me. I didn’t realize that there were any Shin philosophers of note.”</p>
<p class="para">Shallan looked at the four books by Gabrathin. She had no idea which one she should take, so she avoided the question, pointing at the two collections he had mentioned first and the single volume by Shauka-daughter-Hasweth. A philosopher from distant Shin, where people lived in mud and worshipped rocks? The man who had killed Jasnah’s father nearly six years before—prompting the war against the Parshendi in Natanatan—had been Shin. The Assassin in White, they called him.</p>
<p class="para">“I will take those three,” Shallan said, “along with the histories.”</p>
<p class="para">“Excellent!” the merchant repeated. “For buying so many, I will give you a fair discount. Let us say, ten emerald broams?”</p>

<p class="para">Shallan nearly choked. An emerald broam was the largest denomination of sphere, worth a thousand diamond chips. Ten of them was more than her trip to Kharbranth had cost by several magnitudes!</p>
<p class="para">She opened her satchel, looking in at her money pouch. She had around eight emerald broams left. She’d have to take fewer of the books, obviously, but which ones?</p>
<p class="para">Suddenly, the door slammed open. Shallan jumped and was surprised to see Yalb standing there, holding his cap in his hands, nervous. He rushed to her chair, going down on one knee. She was too stunned to say anything. Why was he so worried?</p>
<p class="para">“Brightness,” he said, bowing his head. “My master bids you return. He’s reconsidered his offer. Truly, we can take the price you offered.”</p>
<p class="para">Shallan opened her mouth, but found herself stupefied.</p>
<p class="para">Yalb glanced at the merchant. “Brightness, don’t buy from this man. He’s a liar and a cheat. My master will sell you much finer books at a better price.”</p>
<p class="para">“Now, what’s this?” Artmyrn said, standing. “How dare you! Who is your master?”</p>
<p class="para">“Barmest,” Yalb said defensively.</p>
<p class="para">“That rat. He sends a boy into <span class="italic1">my</span> shop trying to steal <span class="italic1">my</span> customer? Outrageous!”</p>
<p class="para">“She came to our shop first!” Yalb said.</p>
<p class="para">Shallan finally recovered her wits. <span class="italic1">Stormfather! He’s quite the actor.</span> “You had your chance,” she said to Yalb. “Run along and tell your master that I refuse to be swindled. I will visit every bookshop in the city if that is what it takes to find someone reasonable.”</p>
<p class="para">“Artmyrn isn’t reasonable,” Yalb said, spitting to the side. The merchant’s eyes opened wide with rage.</p>
<p class="para">“We shall see,” Shallan said.</p>
<p class="para">“Brightness,” Artmyrn said, red faced. “Surely you don’t believe these allegations!”</p>
<p class="para">“And how much were you going to charge her?” Yalb asked.</p>
<p class="para">“Ten emerald broams,” Shallan said. “For those seven books.”</p>
<p class="para">Yalb laughed. “And you didn’t stand up and walk right out! You practically had my master’s ears, and he offered you a better deal than that! Please, Brightness, return with me. We’re ready to—”</p>
<p class="para">“Ten was just an opening figure,” Artmyrn said. “I didn’t expect her to take them.” He looked at Shallan. “Of course, <span class="italic1">eight</span>….”</p>
<p class="para">Yalb laughed again. “I’m sure we have those same books, Brightness. I’ll bet my master gives them to you for two.”</p>
<p class="para">Artmyrn grew even more red-faced, muttering. “Brightness, surely you wouldn’t patronize someone so <span class="italic1">crass</span> as to send a servant into someone else’s shop to steal his customers!”</p>
<p class="para">“Perhaps I would,” Shallan said. “At least he didn’t insult my intelligence.”</p>
<p class="para">Artmyrn’s wife glared at her husband, and the man grew even more red in the face. “Two emerald, three sapphire. That is as low as I can go. If you want cheaper than that, then buy from that scoundrel Barmest. The books will probably be missing pages, though.”</p>
<p class="para">Shallan hesitated, glancing at Yalb; he was caught up in his role, bowing and scraping. She caught his eyes, and he just kind of gave a shrug.</p>
<p class="para">“I’ll do it,” she said to Artmyrn, prompting a groan from Yalb. He slunk away with a curse from Artmyrn’s wife. Shallan rose and counted out the spheres; the emerald broams she retrieved from her safepouch.</p>
<p class="para">Soon, she walked from the shop bearing a heavy canvas bag. She walked down the steep street, and found Yalb lounging beside a lamppost. She smiled as he took the bag from her. “How did you know what a fair price for a book was?” she asked.</p>
<p class="para">“Fair price?” he said, slinging the bag over his shoulder. “For a book? I’ve no idea. I just figured he’d be trying to take you for as much as he could. That’s why I asked around for who his biggest rival was and came back to help get him to be more reasonable.”</p>
<p class="para">“It was that obvious I’d let myself be swindled?” she asked with a blush, the two of them walking out of the side street.</p>
<p class="para">Yalb chuckled. “Just a little. Anyway, conning men like him is almost as much fun as cheating guards. You probably could have gotten him down further by actually leaving with me, then coming back later to give him another chance.”</p>
<p class="para">“That sounds complicated.”</p>
<p class="para">“Merchants is like mercenaries, my gammer always said. Only difference is that merchants will take your head off, then pretend to be your friend all the same.”</p>
<p class="para">This from a man who had just spent the evening cheating a group of guards at cards. “Well, you have my thanks, anyway.”</p>
<p class="para">“Wasn’t nothing. It was fun, though I can’t believe you paid what you did. It’s just a bunch of wood. I could find some driftwood and put some funny marks on it. Would you pay me pure spheres for that too?”</p>
<p class="para">“I can’t offer that,” she said, fishing in her satchel. She took out the picture she’d drawn of Yalb and the porter. “But please, take this, with my thanks.”</p>
<p class="para">Yalb took the picture and stepped up beneath a nearby lantern to get a look. He laughed, cocking his head, smiling broadly. “Stormfather! Ain’t that something? Looks like I’m seeing myself in a polished plate, it does. I can’t take this, Brightness!”</p>
<p class="para">“Please. I insist.” She did, however, blink her eyes, taking a Memory of him standing there, one hand on his chin as he studied the picture of himself. She’d redraw him later. After what he’d done for her, she dearly wanted him in her collection.</p>
<p class="para">Yalb carefully tucked the picture between the pages of a book, then hefted the bag and continued. They stepped back onto the main roadway. Nomon—the middle moon—had begun to rise, bathing the city in pale blue light. Staying up this late had been a rare privilege for her in her father’s house, but these city people around them barely seemed to notice the late hour. What a strange place this city was.</p>
<p class="para">“Back to the ship now?” Yalb asked.</p>
<p class="para">“No,” Shallan said, taking a deep breath. “Back to the Conclave.”</p>
<p class="para">He raised an eyebrow, but led her back. Once there, she bid Yalb farewell, reminding him to take his picture. He did so, wishing her luck before hastening from the Conclave, probably worried about meeting the guardsmen he’d cheated earlier.</p>
<p class="para">Shallan had a servant carry her books, and made her way down the hallway back to the Veil. Just inside the ornate iron doors, she caught the attention of a master-servant.</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, Brightness?” the man asked. Most of the alcoves were now dim, and patient servants were returning tomes to their safe place beyond the crystal walls.</p>
<p class="para">Shaking off her fatigue, Shallan counted up the rows. There was still a light in Jasnah’s alcove. “I’d like to use the alcove there,” she said, pointing to the next balcony over.</p>
<p class="para">“Do you have a chit of admittance?”</p>
<p class="para">“I’m afraid not.”</p>
<p class="para">“Then you’ll have to rent the space if you wish to use it regularly. Two skymarks.”</p>
<p class="para">Wincing at the price, Shallan dug out the proper spheres and paid. Her money pouches were looking depressingly flat. She let the parshman porters haul her up to the appropriate level, then she quietly walked to her alcove. There, she used all her remaining spheres to fill the oversized goblet lamp. To get enough light, she was forced to use spheres of all nine colors and all three sizes, so the illumination was patchy and varied.</p>
<p class="para">Shallan peeked over the side of her alcove, out at the next balcony over. Jasnah sat studying, heedless of the hour, her goblet filled to the brim with pure diamond broams. They were best for light, but less useful in Soulcasting, so weren’t as valuable.</p>
<p class="para">Shallan ducked back around. There was a place at the very edge of the alcove’s table where she could sit, hidden by the wall from Jasnah, so she sat there. Perhaps she should have chosen an alcove on another level, but she wanted to keep an eye on the woman. Hopefully Jasnah would spend weeks here studying. Enough time for Shallan to dedicate herself to some fierce cramming. Her ability to memorize pictures and scenes didn’t work as well on text, but she could learn lists and facts at a rate that her tutors had found remarkable.</p>
<p class="para">She settled herself in the chair, pulling out the books and arranging them. She rubbed her eyes. It was really quite late, but there wasn’t time to waste. Jasnah had said that Shallan could make another petition when the gaps in her knowledge were filled. Well, Shallan intended to fill those gaps in record time, then present herself again. She’d do it when Jasnah was ready to leave Kharbranth.</p>
<p class="para">It was a last, desperate hope, so frail that a strong gust of circumstance seemed likely to topple it. Taking a deep breath, Shallan opened the first of the history books.</p>
<p class="para">“I’m never going to be rid of you, am I?” a soft, feminine voice asked.</p>
<p class="para">Shallan jumped up, nearly knocking over her books as she spun toward the doorway. Jasnah Kholin stood there, deep blue dress embroidered in silver, its silken sheen reflecting the light of Shallan’s spheres. The Soulcaster was covered by a fingerless black glove to block the bright gemstones.</p>
<p class="para">“Brightness,” Shallan said, rising and curtsying in an awkward rush. “I didn’t mean to disturb you. I—”</p>
<p class="para">Jasnah quieted her with a wave of the hand. She stepped aside as a parshman entered Shallan’s alcove, carrying a chair. He placed it beside Shallan’s desk, and Jasnah glided over and sat.</p>
<p class="para">Shallan tried to judge Jasnah’s mood, but the older woman’s emotions were impossible to read. “I honestly didn’t want to disturb you.”</p>
<p class="para">“I bribed the servants to tell me if you returned to the Veil,” Jasnah said idly, picking up one of Shallan’s tomes, reading the title. “I didn’t want to be interrupted again.”</p>
<p class="para">“I—” Shallan looked down, blushing furiously.</p>
<p class="para">“Don’t bother apologizing,” Jasnah said. She looked tired; more tired than Shallan felt. Jasnah picked through the books. “A fine selection. You chose well.”</p>
<p class="para">“It wasn’t really much of a choice,” Shallan said. “It was just about all the merchant had.”</p>
<p class="para">“You intended to study their contents quickly, I assume?” Jasnah said musingly. “Try to impress me one last time before I left Kharbranth?”</p>
<p class="para">Shallan hesitated, then nodded.</p>
<p class="para">“A clever ploy. I should have put a time restriction on your reapplication.” She looked at Shallan, glancing her over. “You are very determined. That is good. And I know why you wish so desperately to be my ward.”</p>
<p class="para">Shallan started. She <span class="italic1">knew</span>?</p>
<p class="para">“Your house has many enemies,” Jasnah continued, “and your father is reclusive. It will be difficult for you to marry well without a tactically sound alliance.”</p>
<p class="para">Shallan relaxed, though she tried to keep it from showing.</p>
<p class="para">“Let me see your satchel,” Jasnah said.</p>
<p class="para">Shallan frowned, resisting the urge to pull it close. “Brightness?”</p>
<p class="para">Jasnah held out her hand. “You recall what I said about repeating myself?”</p>
<p class="para">Reluctantly, Shallan handed it over. Jasnah carefully removed its contents, neatly lining up the brushes, pencils, pens, jar of lacquer, ink, and solvent. She placed the stacks of paper, the notebooks, and the finished pictures in a line. Then she got out Shallan’s money pouches, noting their emptiness. She glanced at the goblet lamp, counting its contents. She raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="para">Next, she began to look through Shallan’s pictures. First the loose-leaf ones, where she lingered on Shallan’s picture of Jasnah herself. Shallan watched the woman’s face. Was she pleased? Surprised? Displeased at how much time Shallan spent sketching sailors and serving women?</p>
<p class="para">Finally, Jasnah moved on to the sketchbook filled with drawings of plants and animals Shallan had observed during her trip. Jasnah spent the longest on this, reading through each notation. “Why have you made these sketches?” Jasnah asked at the end.</p>
<p class="para">“Why, Brightness? Well, because I wanted to.” She grimaced. Should she have said something profound instead?</p>
<p class="para">Jasnah nodded slowly. Then she rose. “I have rooms in the Conclave, granted to me by the king. Gather your things and go there. You look exhausted.”</p>
<p class="para">“Brightness?” Shallan asked, rising, a thrill of excitement running through her.</p>
<p class="para">Jasnah hesitated at the doorway. “At first meeting, I took you for a rural opportunist, seeking only to ride my name to greater wealth.”</p>
<p class="para">“You’ve changed your mind?”</p>
<p class="para">“No,” Jasnah said, “there is undoubtedly some of that in you. But we are each many different people, and you can tell much about a person by what they carry with them. If that notebook is any indication, you pursue scholarship in your free time for its own sake. That is encouraging. It is, perhaps, the best argument you could make on your own behalf.</p>
<p class="para">“If I cannot be rid of you, then I might as well make use of you. Go and sleep. Tomorrow we will begin early, and you will divide your time between your education and helping me with my studies.”</p>

<p class="para">With that, Jasnah withdrew.</p>
<p class="para">Shallan sat, bemused, blinking tired eyes. She got out a sheet of paper and wrote a quick prayer of thanks, which she’d burn later. Then she hurriedly gathered up her books and went looking for a servant to send to the <span class="italic1">Wind’s Pleasure</span> for her trunk.</p>
<p class="para">It had been a very, <span class="italic1">very</span> long day. But she’d won. The first step had been completed.</p>
<p class="para">Now her real task began.</p>
