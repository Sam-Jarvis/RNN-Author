<h2 class="h2b4">A Box Opens</h2>
<p class="para1">“So this is one of the Shadowsouled,” Sorilea said. The white-haired Wise One circled around the prisoner, looking thoughtfully at Semirhage. Of course, Cadsuane had not expected fear from one such as Sorilea. The Aiel woman was a rugged creature, like a statue that had weathered storm after storm, patient before the winds. Among the Aiel, this Wise One was a particular specimen of strength. She had arrived at the manor house only recently, coming with those who had brought al’Thor a report from Bandar Eban.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Cadsuane had anticipated finding many things among the Aiel who followed Rand al’Thor: fierce warriors, strange ways, honor and loyalty, inexperience with subtlety and politics. She had been right. One thing she had certainly <em class="calibre4">not</em> expected to find, however, was an equal. Certainly not in a Wise One who could barely channel. And <a id="page_305" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>yet, oddly, that was how she regarded the leathery-faced Aiel woman.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Not that she trusted Sorilea. The Wise One had her own goals, and they might not completely coincide with Cadsuane’s. However, she <em class="calibre4">did</em> find Sorilea capable, and there were blessed few people in the world these days who deserved that word.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Semirhage flinched suddenly, and Sorilea cocked her head. The Forsaken was not floating this time; she stood upright, wearing the stiff brown dress, her short, dark hair tangled from lack of brushing. She still projected superiority and control. Just as Cadsuane herself would have in a similar situation.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“What are these weaves?” Sorilea asked, gesturing. The weaves in question were the source of Semirhage’s occasional flinching.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“A personal trick of mine,” Cadsuane said, undoing the weaves and remaking them to show how they were done. “They ring a sound in your subjects’ ears every few minutes and flash a light in their eyes, keeping them from sleep.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“You hope to make her so fatigued that she will talk,” Sorilea said, studying the Forsaken again.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Semirhage was warded to keep her from hearing them, of course. Despite two days without decent sleep, the woman wore a serene expression, eyes open but blocked by glowing lights. She had likely mastered some kind of mental trick to help her stave off exhaustion.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“I doubt it will break her,” Cadsuane admitted. “Phaw! It barely even makes her flinch.” She, Sorilea and Bair—an aged Wise One with no channeling ability—were the only ones in the room. The Aes Sedai maintaining Semirhage’s shield sat in their places outside.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_306" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>Sorilea nodded. “One of the Shadowsouled will not be manipulated so easily. Still, you are wise to try, considering your . . . limitations.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“We could speak to the <em class="calibre4">Car’a’carn</em>,” Bair said. “Convince him to turn this one over to us for a time. A few days of . . . delicate Aiel questioning and she would speak whatever you wish.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Cadsuane smiled noncommittally. As if she would let another handle the questioning! This woman’s secrets were too valuable to risk, even in the hands of allies. “Well, you are welcome to ask,” she said, “but I doubt al’Thor will listen. You know how the fool boy can be when it comes to hurting women.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Bair sighed. It was odd to think of this grandmotherly lady engaging in “delicate Aiel questioning.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Yes,” she said. “You are right, I suspect. Rand al’Thor is twice as stubborn as any clan chief I’ve known. And twice as arrogant too. To presume that women cannot bear pain as well as men!”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Cadsuane snorted at that. “To be honest, I considered having this one strung up and whipped, al’Thor’s prohibitions be blackened! But I don’t think it would work. Phaw! We’ll need to find something other than pain to break this one.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Sorilea was still regarding Semirhage. “I would speak with her.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Cadsuane made a motion, dismissing the weaves that kept Semirhage from hearing, seeing or speaking. The woman blinked—just once—to clear her vision, then turned to Sorilea and Bair. “Ah,” she said. “Aiel. You were such good servants, once. Tell me, how strongly does it bite, knowing how you betrayed your oaths? Your ancestors <a id="page_307" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>would cry for punishment if they knew how many deaths lay at the hands of their descendants.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Sorilea gave no reaction. Cadsuane knew some tidbits of what al’Thor had revealed about the Aiel, things that had been said at second or third hand. Al’Thor claimed that the Aiel had once followed the Way of the Leaf, sworn not to do harm, before betraying their oaths. Cadsuane had been interested to learn of these rumors, and she was more interested to hear Semirhage corroborating them.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“She seems so much more human than I had anticipated,” Sorilea said to Bair. “Her expressions, her tone, her accent, while strange, are easy to understand. I had not expected that.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Semirhage’s eyes narrowed for just a moment at that comment. Odd. That was a stronger reaction than virtually any of the punishments had produced. The flashes of light and sound prompted only slight involuntary twitches. This comment of Sorilea’s, however, seemed to affect Semirhage on an emotional level. Would the Wise Ones actually succeed so easily where Cadsuane had long failed?</p>
<p class="indent-para">“I think this is what we need to remember,” Bair said. “A woman is just a woman, no matter how old, no matter what secrets she remembers. Flesh can be cut, blood can be spilled, bones can be broken.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“In truth, I feel almost disappointed, Cadsuane Melaidhrin,” Sorilea said, shaking a white-haired head. “This monster has very small fangs.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Semirhage reacted no further. Her control was back, her face serene, her eyes imperious. “I have heard some little of you new, oathless Aiel and your interpretations of honor. I will very much enjoy investigating how much pain and suffering it will require before members of your <a id="page_308" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>clans will shame themselves. Tell me, how far do you think I would have to push before one of you would kill a blacksmith and dine on his flesh?”</p>
<p class="indent-para">She knew more than “some little” if she understood the near-sacred nature of blacksmiths among the Aiel. Sorilea stiffened at the comment, but let it go. She rewove the ward against listening, then paused, and placed the globes of light in front of Semirhage’s eyes as well. Yes, she was weak in the Power, but she was a very quick learner.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Is it wise to keep her like this?” Sorilea asked, her tone implying that of any other she would have made a demand. For Cadsuane, she softened her words, and it almost brought a smile to Cadsuane’s lips. They were like two aged hawks, Sorilea and she, accustomed to roosting and reigning, now forced to nest in neighboring trees. Deference did not come easily to either one of them.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“If I were to choose,” Sorilea continued, “I think that I would have her throat slit and her corpse laid out on the dust to dry. Keeping her alive is like keeping a snapwood blacklance as a pet.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Phaw!” Cadsuane said, grimacing. “You’re right about the danger, but killing her now would be worse. Al’Thor cannot—or will not—give me an accurate count of the number of Forsaken he has slain, but he implies that at least half of them still live. They’ll be there to fight at the Last Battle, and each weave we learn from Semirhage is one fewer they can use to surprise us.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Sorilea did not seem convinced, but she pressed the issue no further. “And the item?” she asked. “May I see it?”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Cadsuane almost snapped a no. But . . . Sorilea had taught Cadsuane Traveling, an incredibly powerful tool. That had been an offering, a hand extended. Cadsuane needed to work with these women, Sorilea most of all. <a id="page_309" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>Al’Thor was a bigger project than one woman could handle.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Come with me,” Cadsuane said, leaving the wooden room. The Wise Ones followed. Outside, Cadsuane instructed the sisters—Daigian and Sarene—to make certain that Semirhage was kept awake, eyes open. It was unlikely to work, but it was the best strategy Cadsuane had at the moment.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Though . . . she <em class="calibre4">did</em> also have Semirhage’s momentary look, that hint of anger, displayed at Sorilea’s comment. When you could control a person’s anger, you could control their other emotions as well. That was why she had focused so hard on teaching al’Thor to rein in his temper.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Control and anger. What was it that Sorilea had said to get the reaction? That Semirhage seemed disappointingly human. It was as if Sorilea had come expecting one of the Forsaken to be as twisted as a Myrddraal or Draghkar. And why not? The Forsaken had been figures of legend for three thousand years, looming shadows of darkness and mystery. It could be disappointing to discover that they were, in many ways, the most human of the Dark One’s followers: petty, destructive and argumentative. At least, that was how al’Thor claimed they acted. He was so strangely familiar with them.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Semirhage saw herself as more than human, though. That poise, that control of her surroundings, was a source of strength for her.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Cadsuane shook her head. Too many problems and far too little time. The wooden hallway itself was another reminder of the al’Thor boy’s foolishness; Cadsuane could still smell smoke, strong enough to be unpleasant. The gaping hole in the front of the manor—draped only with a cloth—let in chill air during the spring nights. They <a id="page_310" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>should have moved, but he claimed that he would not be chased away.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Al’Thor seemed almost eager for the Last Battle. Or perhaps just resigned. To get there he felt he had to force his way through the petty squabbles of people like a midnight traveler pushing through banks of snow to arrive at the inn. The problem was, al’Thor wasn’t ready for the Last Battle. Cadsuane could feel it in the way he spoke, the way he acted. The way he regarded the world with that dark, nearly dazed expression. If the man he was now faced the Dark One to decide the fate of the world, Cadsuane feared for all people.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Cadsuane and the two Wise Ones reached her chamber in the manor, a sturdy undamaged room with a good view of the trampled green and camp out front. She made few demands in the way of decoration: a stout bed, a lockable trunk, a mirror and stand. She was too old and impatient to bother with anything else.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The trunk was a decoy; she kept some gold and other relatively worthless items in it. Her most precious possessions she either wore—in the form of her <em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em> ornaments—or kept locked in a dingy-looking document box that sat on her mirror stand. Of worn oak, the stain uneven, the box had enough dings and dents to look used—but wasn’t so shabby as to be out of place with her other things. As Sorilea closed the door behind the three of them, Cadsuane disarmed the box’s traps.</p>
<p class="indent-para">It was strange to her how few Aes Sedai learned to innovate with the One Power. They memorized time-tested and traditional weaves, but gave barely a thought for what else they could do. True, experimenting with the One Power could be disastrous, but many simple extrapolations could be made without danger. Her weave for this box was <a id="page_311" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>one such. Until recently, she’d used a standard weave of Fire, Spirit and Air to destroy any documents in the box if an intruder opened it. Effective, if a bit unimaginative.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Her new weave was much more versatile. It didn’t destroy the items in the box—Cadsuane wasn’t certain if they could be destroyed. Instead, the weaves—inverted to be invisible—sprang out in twisting threads of Air and captured anyone in the room when the box was opened. Then another weave set out a large sound, imitating a hundred trumpets playing while lights flashed in the air to give the alarm. The weaves would also go off if anyone opened the box, moved it, or barely touched it with the most delicate thread of the One Power.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Cadsuane flipped up the lid. The extreme precaution was necessary. For inside this box were two items that presented very serious danger.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Sorilea walked over, looking in at the contents. One was a figurine of a wise, bearded man holding aloft a sphere, about a foot tall. The other was a black metallic collar and two bracelets: an <em class="calibre4">a’dam</em> made for a man. With this <em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em>, a woman could turn a man who could channel into her slave, controlling his ability to touch the One Power. Perhaps controlling him completely. They had not tested the collar. Al’Thor had forbidden it.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Sorilea hissed quietly, ignoring the statue and focusing on the bracelets and collar. “This thing is evil.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Yes,” Cadsuane said. Rarely would she have called a simple object “evil,” but this one was. “Nynaeve al’Meara claims some familiarity with this thing. Though I have not been able to press out of the girl <em class="calibre4">how</em> she knows these things, she claims to know that there was only one male <em class="calibre4">a’dam</em>, and that she’d arranged for its disposal in the ocean. She also admits, however, that she didn’t see it destroyed <a id="page_312" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>personally. It may have been used as a pattern by the Seanchan.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“This is unsettling to see,” Sorilea said. “If one of the Shadowsouled, or even one of the Seanchan, captured him with this. . . .”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Light protect us all,” Bair whispered.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“And the people who have these are the same people with whom al’Thor wishes to make peace?” Sorilea shook her head. “Creation of these abominations alone should warrant a blood feud. I heard that there were others like it. What of those?”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Stored elsewhere,” Cadsuane said, shutting the lid. “Along with the female <em class="calibre4">a’dam</em> we took. Some acquaintances of mine—Aes Sedai who have retired from the world—are testing them trying to discover their weakness.” They also had <em class="calibre4">Callandor</em>. Cadsuane was loath to let it out of her sight, but she felt that the sword still held secrets that could be teased out.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“I keep this one here because I intend to find a way to test it on a man,” she said. “That would be the best way to discover its weaknesses. Al’Thor won’t allow any of his Asha’man to be leashed by it, however. Not for the shortest time.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">This made Bair uncomfortable. “A little like testing a spear’s strength by stabbing it into someone,” she muttered.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Sorilea, however, nodded in agreement. She understood.</p>
<p class="indent-para">One of the first things Cadsuane had done after capturing those female <em class="calibre4">a’dam</em> was put one on and practice ways to escape from it. She’d done so under carefully controlled circumstances, of course, with women she trusted to help her escape. They’d eventually had to do that. Cadsuane had been able to discover no way out on her own.</p>
<p class="indent-para">But if your enemy was planning to do something to you, <a id="page_313" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>you had to discover how to counter it. Even if that meant leashing yourself. Al’Thor couldn’t see this. When she asked, he simply muttered about “that bloody box” and being beaten.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“We have to do something about that man,” Sorilea said, meeting Cadsuane’s eyes. “He has grown worse since we last met.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“He has,” Cadsuane said. “He’s surprisingly accomplished at ignoring my training.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Then let us discuss,” Sorilea said, pulling over a stool. “A plan must be arranged. For the good of all.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“For the good of all,” Cadsuane agreed. “Al’Thor himself most of all.”</p>
