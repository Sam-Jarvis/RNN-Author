<p class="ct"><span class="epub-i">Your Neck in a Cord</span></p>
<p class="tni">The Tarasin Palace of Ebou Dar was <span class="epub-i1">far</span> from the most difficult place that Mat had broken into. He told himself that over and over again as he dangled outside a balcony three stories above the gardens.</p>
<p class="tx">He clung to a marble ledge with one hand while holding his hat on his head with the other, his <span class="epub-i1">ashandarei</span> strapped to his back. He’d stowed his bundle in the gardens below. The night air was cool against the sweat running down the sides of his face.</p>
<p class="tx">Above, a pair of Deathwatch Guards clanked as they moved on the balcony. Blood and bloody ashes. Did those fellows never take off their armor? They looked like beetles. He could barely make them out. The balcony was surrounded by an ironwork screen to keep people from looking in at the occupants from below, but Mat was close enough to see the guards moving inside through it.</p>
<p class="tx">Light, they were spending a long time in there. Mat’s arm started to ache. The two men murmured to one another. Perhaps they were going to sit down and have some tea. Pull out a book, start reading into the night. Tuon really needed to dismiss these two. Why were they having a leisurely conversation on a balcony? There could be assassins out here!</p>
<p class="tx">Eventually, thank the Light, the two moved on. Mat tried to count to ten before swinging up, but only lasted to seven. He pushed open one of the unlatched screens, and scrambled over the balcony railing.</p>
<p class="tx">Mat exhaled softly, arms aching. This palace—those two guards notwithstanding—was nowhere near as impregnable as the Stone had been, and Mat had gotten in there. He had another advantage here, of course: He had lived in this palace, free to come and go. For the most part. He scratched at his neck, and the scarf he wore there. For a moment it felt like a ribbon that felt like a chain.</p>
<p class="tx">Mat’s father had an adage: Always know which way you are going to ride. There never was a man as honest as Abell Cauthon, and everyone knew it, but some folk—like those up in Taren Ferry—could not be trusted farther than they could spit. In trading horses, Abell had always said, you needed to be ready to ride, and you always had to know which way you were going to go.</p>
<p class="tx">In his two months living in this palace, Mat had learned every way out—every crack and passage, every loose window. Which balcony screens were easy to open, which were usually locked tight. If you could sneak out, you could sneak in. He rested a moment on the balcony, but did not enter the room it was attached to. He was on the third floor, where guests stayed. He might have been able to sneak in this way, but the guts of a building were always better guarded than the skin. Best to go up the outside.</p>
<p class="tx">Doing so involved a lot of <span class="epub-i1">not</span> looking down. Fortunately, the side of the building was not difficult to scale. Stonework and wood with plenty of handholds. He remembered chastising Tylin about that once.</p>
<p class="tx">Sweat crept down Mat’s brow like ants down a hill as he crawled out onto the screen, pulled himself upward and started toward the fourth level. The <span class="epub-i1">ashandarei</span> occasionally banged his legs from behind. He could smell the sea on the breeze. Things always smelled better when one was up high. Perhaps that was because heads smelled better than feet did.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Stupid thought, that,</span> Mat told himself. Anything to keep from thinking about the height. He pulled himself up onto a piece of stonework, slipping with one foot below and lurching. He breathed in and out, panting, then continued on.</p>
<p class="tx">There. Above, he could see Tylin’s balcony. Her quarters had several, of course; he went for the one at her bedroom, not the one attached to her sitting room. That one was on the Mol Hara Square, and climbing there, he would be as obvious as a fly in a white pudding.</p>
<p class="tx">He looked up again at the arabesque-covered iron balcony. He had always wondered if he could climb to it. He had certainly considered climbing <span class="epub-i1">out</span> of it.</p>
<p class="tx">Well, he would not be a fool and try this sort of thing again, that was for certain. Just this once, and grudgingly. Matrim Cauthon knew to look out for his own neck. He had not survived this long by taking fool chances, luck or no luck. If Tuon wanted to live in a city where the head of her armies was trying to have her assassinated, that was her choice.</p>
<p class="tx">He nodded to himself. He would climb up, explain to her in very rational tones that she needed to leave the city and that this General Galgan was betraying her. Then he could saunter on his way and find himself some games of dice. That was why he had come to the city, after all. If Rand was up north, where all the Trollocs were, then Mat wanted to be as far from the man as possible. He felt bad for Rand, but any sane person would see that Mat’s choice was the only one. The swirl of colors started to form, but Mat suppressed it.</p>
<p class="tx">Rational. He would be very rational.</p>
<p class="tx">Sweating, cursing, his hands aching, Mat pulled himself up to the balcony on the fourth floor. One of the screen latches was loose here, as it had been when he lived in the palace. Quick work with a small wire hook was all he needed to get in. He entered the enclosed balcony, took off the <span class="epub-i1">ashandarei</span>, then lay down on his back, panting as if he had just run all the way from Andor to Tear.</p>
<p class="tx">After a few minutes of that, he hauled himself to his feet, then looked out the unlatched screen down four stories. Mat felt pretty good about that climb.</p>
<p class="tx">He picked up the <span class="epub-i1">ashandarei</span> and went to the balcony doors. Tuon would undoubtedly have moved in here, to Tylin’s rooms. They were the finest in the palace. Mat cracked the doors open. He would just peek and—</p>
<p class="tx">Something shot from the shadows before him and slammed into the door just above his head.</p>
<p class="tx">Mat dropped, rolling, pulling out a knife with one hand and holding the <span class="epub-i1">ashandarei</span> with the other. The door creaked open from the force of the crossbow bolt lodged in its wood.</p>
<p class="tx">Selucia looked out a moment later. She had the right side of her head shaven clean, the other side covered in cloth. Her skin was the color of cream, but any man who thought her soft would soon learn otherwise. Selucia could teach sandpaper a thing or two about being tough.</p>
<p class="tx">She leveled a small crossbow at him, and Mat found himself smiling. “I knew it!” he exclaimed. “You’re a bodyguard. You always were.”</p>
<p class="tx">Selucia scowled. “What are you doing here, you fool?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Oh, just going for a stroll,” Mat said, picking himself up and sheathing his knife. “The night air is said to be good for a fellow. The sea breeze. That sort of thing.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Did you <span class="epub-i1">climb</span> up here?” Selucia asked, glancing over the side of the balcony, as if looking for a rope or ladder.</p>
<p class="tx">“What? You don’t climb up normally? It’s very good for the arms. Improves grip.”</p>
<p class="tx">She gave him a suffering look, and Mat found himself grinning. If Selucia was on the lookout for assassins, then Tuon was probably all right. He nodded toward the crossbow, which was still leveled toward him. “Are you going to…”</p>
<p class="tx">She paused, then sighed and lowered it.</p>
<p class="tx">“Many thanks,” Mat said. “You could put a man’s eye out with that thing, and normally I wouldn’t mind, but I’m running short on eyes these days.”</p>
<p class="tx">“What did you do?” Selucia asked dryly. “Go dicing with a bear?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Selucia!” Mat said, walking past her to enter the rooms. “That was quite near to a joke. I should think that, with a little effort, we might be able to grow you a sense of humor. That would be so unexpected, we could put you in a menagerie and charge money to see you. ‘Come see the marvelous laughing <span class="epub-i1">so’jhin</span>. Two coppers only, tonight…’ ”</p>
<p class="tx">“You bet the eye on something, didn’t you?”</p>
<p class="tx">Mat stumbled, pushing open the door. He chuckled. Light! That was strangely close to the truth. “Very cute.”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">It’s a bet I won,</span> he thought, <span class="epub-i1">no matter how it may seem.</span> Matrim Cauthon was the only man to have diced with the fate of the world itself in the prize pouch. Of course, next time, they could find some fool hero to take his place. Like Rand or Perrin. Those two were so full of heroism, it was practically dripping out their mouths and down their chins. He suppressed the images that tried to form. Light! He had to stop thinking of those two.</p>
<p class="tx">“Where is she?” Mat asked, looking about the bedchamber. The sheets of the bed were disturbed—he earnestly did not imagine pink ribbons tied to that headboard—but Tuon was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p class="tx">“Out,” Selucia said.</p>
<p class="tx">“<span class="epub-i1">Out?</span> It’s the middle of the night!”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes. A time when only assassins would visit. You are lucky that my aim was off, Matrim Cauthon.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Never you bloody mind that,” Mat said. “You’re her bodyguard.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t know what you mean,” Selucia said, making the little crossbow vanish into her robes. “I am <span class="epub-i1">so’jhin</span> to the Empress, may she live forever. I am her Voice and her Truthspeaker.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Lovely,” Mat said, glancing at the bed. “You’re decoying for her, aren’t you? Lying in her bed? With a crossbow ready, should assassins try to sneak in?”</p>
<p class="tx">Selucia said nothing.</p>
<p class="tx">“Well, where is she?” Mat demanded. “Bloody ashes, woman! This is serious. General Galgan himself has hired men to kill her!”</p>
<p class="tx">“That?” Selucia asked. “You’re worried about <span class="epub-i1">that</span>?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Bloody right, I am.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Galgan is nothing to worry about,” Selucia said. “He’s too good a soldier to jeopardize our current stabilization efforts. Krisa is the one you should be worried about. She has brought in three assassins from Seanchan.” Selucia glanced at the balcony doorway. Mat noticed for the first time a stain on the floor that might have been blood. “I have caught two so far. Pity. I assumed you were the third.” She eyed him, as if considering that he might—against all logic—somehow be that assassin.</p>
<p class="tx">“You’re bloody insane,” Mat said, tugging on his hat and fetching his <span class="epub-i1">ashandarei</span>. “I’m going to Tuon.”</p>
<p class="tx">“That is no longer her name, may she live forever. She is known as Fortuona; you should not address her by either name, but instead as ‘Highest One’ or ‘Greatest One.’ ”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’ll call her what I bloody well please,” Mat said. “Where is she?”</p>
<p class="tx">Selucia studied him.</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m <span class="epub-i1">not</span> an assassin,” he said.</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t believe that you are. I am trying to decide if she would like me to tell you her location.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m her husband, am I not?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Hush,” Selucia said. “You just tried to convince me you weren’t an assassin, now you bring up that? Fool man. She is in the palace gardens.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It’s the—”</p>
<p class="tx">“—middle of the night,” Selucia said. “Yes, I know. She does not always … listen to logic.” He caught a hint of exasperation in her tone. “She has an entire squad of the Deathwatch Guard with her.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t care if she has the Creator himself with her,” Mat snapped, walking back toward the balcony. “I’m going to go sit her down and explain some things to her.”</p>
<p class="tx">Selucia followed and leaned against the doorway, raising a skeptical gaze to him.</p>
<p class="tx">“Well, maybe I won’t sit her down, really,” Mat said, looking through the open screen at the gardens below. “But I will explain to her—logically—why she can’t just go wandering in the night like this. At least, I’ll mention it to her. Blood and bloody ashes. We really are high up, aren’t we?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Normal people use stairs.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Every soldier in the city is looking for me,” Mat said. “I think Galgan is trying to make me vanish.”</p>
<p class="tx">Selucia pursed her lips.</p>
<p class="tx">“You didn’t know about this?” Mat asked.</p>
<p class="tx">She hesitated, then shook her head. “It’s not impossible that Galgan would be on the watch for you. The Prince of the Ravens would be competition, under normal circumstances. He is general of our armies, but that is a task often assigned to the Prince of the Ravens.”</p>
<p class="tx">Prince of the Ravens. “Don’t bloody remind me,” Mat said. “I thought that was my title when I was married to the Daughter of the Nine Moons. It hasn’t changed at her elevation?”</p>
<p class="tx">“No,” Selucia said. “Not yet.”</p>
<p class="tx">Mat nodded, then sighed as he looked at the climb ahead of him. He lifted one leg up onto the railing.</p>
<p class="tx">“There is another way,” Selucia said. “Come before you break your fool neck. I do not know yet what she wants with you, but I doubt it involves you falling to your death.”</p>
<p class="tx">Mat gratefully hopped off the balcony railing, following Selucia into the room. She opened a wardrobe, and then opened the back into a dark passageway enclosed in the wood and stone of the palace.</p>
<p class="tx">“Blood and bloody ashes,” Mat said, sticking his head in. “This was here all along?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="tx">“This might be how it got in,” Mat murmured. “You need to board this thing up, Selucia.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’ve done better. When the Empress sleeps—may she live forever—she sleeps in the attic. She never slumbers in this room. We have not forgotten how easily Tylin was taken.”</p>
<p class="tx">“That’s good,” Mat said. He shuddered. “I found the thing that did that. He won’t be ripping out any more throats. Tylin and Nalesean can have a little dance together about that. Farewell, Selucia. Thank you.”</p>
<p class="tx">“For the passageway?” she asked. “Or for failing to kill you with the crossbow?”</p>
<p class="tx">“For not bloody calling me Highness like Musenge and the others,” Mat muttered, entering the passage. He found a lantern hung on the wall, and lit it with his flint and tinder.</p>
<p class="tx">Behind him, Selucia laughed. “If that bothers you, Cauthon, you have a very irritating life ahead of you. There is only one way to stop being the Prince of the Ravens, and that is to find your neck in a cord.” She closed the door to the wardrobe.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">What a pleasant woman she is,</span> Mat thought. He almost preferred the days when she would not talk to him. Shaking his head, he started down the passage, realizing she had never told him exactly where it led.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Rand strode through Elayne’s camp at the eastern edge of Braem Wood, accompanied by a pair of Maidens. The camp was dark, evening upon them, but few slept. They were making preparations to break camp and move the army east toward Cairhien the next morning.</p>
<p class="tx">Only two guards for Rand tonight. He felt almost <span class="epub-i1">exposed</span> with two guards, though once he had thought any number of guards at all to be excessive. The inevitable turning of the Wheel had changed his perception as surely as it changed the seasons.</p>
<p class="tx">He walked a lantern-lit pathway that had obviously once been a game trail. This camp hadn’t been here long enough to have pathways otherwise. Soft noises broke the nights calm: supplies being loaded on to carts, sword blades being ground on whetstones, meals being distributed to hungry soldiers.</p>
<p class="tx">The men did not call to one another. Not only was it night, but the Shadow’s forces were near in the forest, and Trollocs had good ears. Best to be in the habit of speaking softly, not shouting from one side of the camp to another. The lanterns had shields to give only a soft light, and cook fires were kept to a minimum.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand left the trail, carrying his long bundle, passing through rustling high grass in the clearing on his way to Tam’s tent. This would be a quick trip. He nodded to those soldiers who saluted as he passed on the path. They were shocked to see him, but not surprised that he walked the camp. Elayne had made her armies aware of his earlier visit.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">I lead these armies,</span> she had said as they parted last time, <span class="epub-i1">but you are their heart. You gathered them, Rand. They fight for you. Please let them see you when you come.</span></p>
<p class="tx">And so he did. He wished he could protect them better, but he would simply have to carry that burden. The secret, it turned out, had not been to harden himself to the point of breaking. It had not been to become numb. It had been to walk in pain, like the pain of the wounds at his side, and accept that pain as part of him.</p>
<p class="tx">Two men from Emond’s Field guarded Tam’s tent. Rand nodded to them as they straightened up, saluting. Ban al’Seen and Dav al’Thone—once, he would never have thought to see them salute. They did it well, too.</p>
<p class="tx">“You have a solemn task, men,” Rand said to them. “As important as any on this battlefield.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Defending Andor, my Lord?” Dav asked, confused.</p>
<p class="tx">“No,” Rand said. “Watching over my father. Take care you do it well.” He pushed into the tent, leaving the Maidens outside.</p>
<p class="tx">Tam stood over a travel table, inspecting maps. Rand smiled. It was the same look Tam had worn when inspecting a sheep that had gotten caught in the thicket.</p>
<p class="tx">“You seem to think I’ll need watching,” Tam said.</p>
<p class="tx">Responding to that comment, Rand decided, would be like walking up to an archer’s nest and daring anyone inside to hit him. Instead, he set his bundle down on the table. Tam regarded the long, cloth-wrapped bundle, then tugged at its covering. The cloth came off, revealing a majestic sword with a black-lacquered sheath painted with entwined dragons of red and gold.</p>
<p class="tx">Tam looked up with a question in his eyes.</p>
<p class="tx">“You gave me your sword,” Rand said. “And I wasn’t able to return it. This is a replacement.”</p>
<p class="tx">Tam slid the sword from its sheath, and his eyes widened. “This is too fine a gift, son.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Nothing is too fine for you,” Rand whispered. “Nothing.”</p>
<p class="tx">Tam shook his head, slipping the blade back into the sheath. “It will just end up in a trunk, forgotten like the last one. I should never have brought that thing home. You put too much care into that blade.” He moved to hand the sword back.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand put his hand over Tam’s. “Please. A blademaster deserves a fitting weapon. Take it—that will ease my conscience. Light knows, any burden I can lighten now will help in the days to come.”</p>
<p class="tx">Tam grimaced. “That’s a dirty trick, Rand.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I know. I’ve been spending my time with all kinds of unsavory types lately. Kings, clerks, lords and ladies.”</p>
<p class="tx">Tam reluctantly took the sword back.</p>
<p class="tx">“Think of it as a thank-you,” Rand said, “from all the world to you. If you had not taught me of the flame and the void all those years ago … Light, Father. I wouldn’t be here right now. I’d be dead, I’m sure of that.” Rand looked down at the sword. “To think. If you hadn’t wanted me to be a good archer, I’d have never learned the thing that kept me sane through the rough times.”</p>
<p class="tx">Tam sniffed. “The flame and the void aren’t about archery.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes, I know. They are a swordsman’s technique.”</p>
<p class="tx">“They’re not about swords either,” Tam said, strapping the sword onto his belt.</p>
<p class="tx">“But—”</p>
<p class="tx">“The flame and the void are about center,” Tam said. “And about peace. I would teach it to each and every person in this land, soldier or not, if I could.” His expression softened. “But, Light, what am I doing? Lecturing you? Tell me, where did you get this weapon?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I found it.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It’s as fine a blade as I’ve ever seen.” Tam pulled it out again, looking at the folds of the metal. “It’s ancient. And used. Well-used. Cared for, certainly, but this didn’t just sit in some warlord’s trophy case. Men have swung this blade. Killed with it.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It belonged … to a kindred soul.”</p>
<p class="tx">Tam looked at him, searching his eyes. “Well, I suppose I should try it out, then. Come on.”</p>
<p class="tx">“In the night?”</p>
<p class="tx">“It’s early evening still,” Tam said. “This is a good time. The practice grounds won’t be clogged.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand raised an eyebrow, but stepped aside as Tam rounded the table and left the tent. Rand followed, the Maidens falling in behind them, and trailed his father to the nearby practice grounds, where a few Warders sparred, lit by glowing lanterns on poles.</p>
<p class="tx">Near the rack of wooden practice weapons, Tam took the new sword out and moved into a few forms. Though his hair was gray, his face creased around the eyes, Tam al’Thor moved like a ribbon of silk in the wind. Rand had never seen his father fight, not even spar. In truth, a piece of him had had trouble imagining gentle Tam al’Thor killing anything other than a grouse for the firepit.</p>
<p class="tx">Now he saw. Lit by flickering lantern light, Tam al’Thor slipped into the sword forms like a comfortable pair of boots. Oddly, Rand found himself jealous. Not of his father specifically, but of any who could know the peace of sword practice. Rand held up his hand, then the stump of the other. Many of the forms required two hands. To fight as Tam did was not the same as fighting with shortsword and shield, as many men in the infantry did. This was something else. Rand might still be able to fight, but he could never do <span class="epub-i1">this</span>. No more than a man missing one foot could dance.</p>
<p class="tx">Tam completed Hare Finds Its Hole, sliding the weapon into its sheath in one smooth motion. Orange lantern light reflected off of the blade as it slipped into its cover. “Beautiful,” Tam said. “Light, the weight, the construction … Is it Power-forged?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I believe it to be,” Rand said.</p>
<p class="tx">He’d never had a chance to fight with it.</p>
<p class="tx">Tam took a cup of water from a serving boy. A few newer recruits ran through pike formations in the distance, working late into the night. Every moment of training was precious, particularly for those who were not often on the front lines.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">New recruits,</span> Rand thought, watching them. <span class="epub-i1">These, too, are my burden. Every man who fights.</span></p>
<p class="tx">He would find a way to defeat the Dark One. If he did not, these men fought in vain.</p>
<p class="tx">“You’re worried, son,” Tam said, handing the cup back to the serving boy.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand calmed himself, finding peace, turning to Tam. He remembered, from his old memories, something from a book. <span class="epub-i1">The key to leadership is in the rippling waves.</span> You could not find stillness on a body of water if there was turmoil underneath. Likewise, you could not find peace and focus in a group unless the leader himself had peace within.</p>
<p class="tx">Tam eyed him, but did not challenge Rand on the sudden mask of control that he had adopted. Instead, Tam reached to the side and took one of the balanced wooden practice swords from the rack. He tossed it to Rand, who caught it, standing with his other arm folded behind his back.</p>
<p class="tx">“Father,” Rand said warningly as his father picked up another sparring sword. “This is not a good idea.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’ve heard you became quite the swordsman,” Tam said, taking a few swipes with the practice sword to test its balance. “I’d like to see what you can do. Call it a father’s pride.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand sighed, holding up his other arm, displaying the stump. People’s eyes tended to slide off it, as if they were seeing a Gray Man. They didn’t like the idea that their Dragon Reborn was flawed.</p>
<p class="tx">He never let them know how tired he felt, inside. His body was worn, like a millstone that had worked for generations. He was still tough enough to do his job, and he <span class="epub-i1">would</span>, but Light, he felt tired sometimes. Carrying the hopes of millions was heavier than lifting any mountain.</p>
<p class="tx">Tam didn’t pay any heed to the stump. He took out a handkerchief and wrapped it around one of his hands, then tied it tight using his teeth. “I won’t be able to grip a thing with my off hand,” he said, swinging the sword again. “It will be a fair fight. Come on, son.”</p>
<p class="tx">Tam’s voice carried authority—the authority of a father. It was the same tone he had once used to get Rand out of bed to go muck the milking shed.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand couldn’t disobey that voice, not Tam’s. It was just built into him. He sighed, stepping forward. “I don’t need the sword to fight any longer. I have the One Power.”</p>
<p class="tx">“That would be important,” Tam said, “if sparring right now had anything to do with fighting.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand frowned. What—</p>
<p class="tx">Tam came at him.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand parried with a halfhearted swing. Tam moved into Feathers in the Wind, spinning his sword and delivering a second blow. Rand stepped back, parrying again. Something stirred inside of him, an eagerness. As Tam attacked a second time, Rand lifted the sword and—by instinct—brought his hands together.</p>
<p class="tx">Only, he didn’t have his other hand to grip the bottom of the sword. That left his grip weak, and when Tam hit again, it nearly twisted the sword out of Rand’s grip.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand set his teeth, stepping back. What would Lan say, if he’d seen this shoddy performance by one of his students? <span class="epub-i1">What would he say? He’d say, “Rand, don’t get into swordfights. You can’t win them. Not any longer.”</span></p>
<p class="tx">Tam’s next attack feinted right, then came around and hit Rand on the thigh with a solid thump. Rand danced backward, smarting. Tam had actually <span class="epub-i1">hit</span> him, and hard. The man certainly wasn’t holding back.</p>
<p class="tx">How long had it been since Rand had sparred with someone who was actually willing to hurt him? Too many treated him like glass. Lan had never done that.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand threw himself into the fight, trying Boar Rushes Down the Mountain. He beat at Tam for a few moments, but then a slap from Tam’s weapon almost twisted the sword from Rand’s hand again. The long swords, designed for swordmasters, were difficult to stabilize correctly without a second hand.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand growled, again trying to fall into a two-handed stance, again failing. He’d learned, by now, to deal with what he had lost—in normal life, at least. He hadn’t spent time sparring since the physical loss, although he’d intended to.</p>
<p class="tx">He felt like a chair that was missing one of its legs. He could balance, with effort, but not very well. He fought, he tried form after form, but he barely held on against Tam’s attacks.</p>
<p class="tx">He couldn’t do it. Not well, so why was he bothering? In this activity, he was defective. Sparring made no sense. He turned, sweat streaming from his brow, and threw his coat aside. He tried again, stepping carefully on the trampled grass, but again Tam got the better of him, nearly knocking his feet out from under him.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">This is pointless! Why fight one-handed? Why not find another way? Why</span> … </p>
<p class="tx">Tam was doing it.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand continued to fight, defensive, but he directed his attention to Tam. His father must have practiced fighting one-handed; Rand could read it in his movements, the way he didn’t try—by instinct—to keep grabbing the hilt with his bound hand. Upon consideration, Rand probably should have practiced sparring one-handed. Many wounds could hurt the hand, and some forms focused on arm attacks. Lan had told him to practice reversing his grips. Perhaps fighting with one hand would have come next.</p>
<p class="tx">“Let go, son,” Tam said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Let go of what?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Everything.” Tam came rushing in, throwing shadows in the lantern light, and Rand sought the void. All emotion went into the flame, leaving him empty and whole at once.</p>
<p class="tx">The next attack nearly cracked his head. Rand cursed, coming into Heron in the Reeds as Lan had taught him, sword up to block the next blow. Again, that missing hand of his tried to grip the hilt. One could not unlearn years of training in an evening!</p>
<p class="tx">Let go.</p>
<p class="tx">Wind blew through across the field, carrying with it the scents of a dying land. Moss, mold, rot.</p>
<p class="tx">Moss lived. Mold was a living thing. For a tree to rot, life had to progress.</p>
<p class="tx">A man with one hand was still a man, and if that hand held a sword, he was still dangerous.</p>
<p class="tx">Tam fell into Hawk Spots the Hare, a very aggressive form. He charged Rand, swinging. Rand saw the next few moments before they happened. He saw himself raising his sword in the proper form to block—a form that required him to expose his sword to bad balance, now that he had no second hand. He saw Tam slicing down on the sword to twist it in Rand’s grip. He saw the next attack coming back and taking Rand at the neck.</p>
<p class="tx">Tam would freeze before hitting. Rand would lose the spar.</p>
<p class="tx">Let go.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand shifted his grip on the sword. He didn’t think about why; he did what felt right. When Tam came near, Rand flung his left arm up to stabilize his hand while pivoting his sword to the side. Tam connected, weapon sliding off Rand’s sword, but not unhanding it.</p>
<p class="tx">Tam’s backswing came as expected, but hit Rand’s elbow, the elbow of the useless arm. Not so useless after all. It blocked the sword effectively, though the <span class="epub-i1">crack</span> of it hitting sent a shiver of pain down Rand’s arm.</p>
<p class="tx">Tam froze, eyes widening—first in surprise that he’d been blocked, then in apparent worry over connecting with a solid blow on Rand’s arm. He had probably fractured the bone.</p>
<p class="tx">“Rand,” Tam said, “I…”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand stepped back, folded his wounded arm behind his back, and lifted his sword. He breathed in the deep scents of a world wounded, but not dead.</p>
<p class="tx">He attacked. Kingfisher Strikes in the Nettles. Rand didn’t choose it; it happened. Perhaps it was his posture, sword out, other arm folded behind his back. That led him easily into the offensive form.</p>
<p class="tx">Tam blocked, wary, stepping to the side in the brown grass. Rand swung to the side, flowing into his next form. He stopped trying to turn off his instincts, and his body adapted to the challenge. Safe within the void, he didn’t need to wonder how.</p>
<p class="tx">The contest continued in earnest, now. Swords clacking with sharp blows, Rand keeping his hand behind his back and <span class="epub-i1">feeling</span> what his next strike should be. He did not fight as well as he once had. He could not; some forms were impossible for him, and he could not strike with as much force as he once could.</p>
<p class="tx">He did match Tam. To an extent. Any swordsman could tell who was the better as they fought. Or, at least, they could tell who had the advantage. Tam had it here. Rand was younger and stronger, but Tam was just so <span class="epub-i1">solid</span>. He <span class="epub-i1">had</span> practiced fighting with one hand. Rand was certain of it.</p>
<p class="tx">He did not care. This focus … he had missed this focus. With so much to worry about, so much to carry, he had not been able to dedicate himself to something as simple as a duel. He found it now, and poured himself into it.</p>
<p class="tx">For a time, he wasn’t the Dragon Reborn. He wasn’t even a son with his father. He was a student with his master.</p>
<p class="tx">In this, he remembered that no matter how good he had become, no matter how much he now remembered, there was still much he could learn.</p>
<p class="tx">They continued to spar. Rand did not count who had won which exchange; he just fought and enjoyed the peace of it. Eventually, he found himself exhausted in the good way—not in the worn-down way he had begun to feel lately. It was the exhaustion of good work done.</p>
<p class="tx">Sweating, Rand raised his practice sword to Tam, indicating that he was through. Tam stepped back, raising his own sword. The older man wore a grin.</p>
<p class="tx">Nearby, standing near the lanterns, a handful of Warders began clapping. Not a large audience—only six men—but Rand had not noticed them. The Maidens lifted their spears in salute.</p>
<p class="tx">“It has been quite a weight, hasn’t it?” Tam asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“What weight?” Rand replied.</p>
<p class="tx">“That lost hand you’ve been carrying.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand looked down at his stump. “Yes. I believe it has been at that.”</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Tylin’s secret passage led to the gardens, opening up in a very narrow hole not far from where Mat had begun his climb. He crawled out, brushing the dust off of his shoulders and knees, then craned his neck back and looked up to the balcony far above. He had ascended to the building’s heights, then crawled out through its bowels. Maybe there was a lesson in that somewhere. Maybe it was that Matrim Cauthon should look for secret passages before deciding to scale a bloody four-story building.</p>
<p class="tx">He stepped softly into the gardens. The plants were not doing well. These ferns should have far more fronds, and the trees were as bare as a Maiden in the sweat tent. Not surprising. The entire land wilted faster than a boy at Bel Tine with no dancing partners. Mat was pretty sure Rand was to blame. Rand or the Dark One. Mat could trace every bloody problem in his life to one or the other. Those flaming colors…</p>
<p class="tx">Moss still lived. Mat had not ever heard of moss being used in a garden, but he could have sworn that here it had been made to grow on rocks in patterns. Perhaps, when everything died off, the gardeners used what they could find.</p>
<p class="tx">It took him some searching, poking through dried shrubs and past dead flower beds, to find Tuon. He had expected to find her sitting peacefully in thought, but he should have known better.</p>
<p class="tx">Mat crouched beside a fern, unseen by the dozen or so Deathwatch Guards who stood in a ring around Tuon as she went through a series of fighting stances. She was lit by a pair of lanterns that gave off a strange, steady blue glow. Something burned within them, but it was not a regular flame.</p>
<p class="tx">The light shone on her soft, smooth skin, which was the shade of good earth. She wore a pale <span class="epub-i1">a’solma</span>, a gown that was split at the sides, showing blue leggings underneath. Tuon had a slight frame; he had once made the mistake of assuming that meant she was frail. Not so.</p>
<p class="tx">She had shaved her head again properly, now that she was no longer hiding. Baldness looked good on her, strange though it was. She moved in the blue glow, running through a sequence of hand combat forms, her eyes closed. She seemed to be sparring with her own shadow.</p>
<p class="tx">Mat preferred a good knife—or, better, his <span class="epub-i1">ashandarei</span>—to fighting with his hands. The more space he had between himself and a fellow trying to kill him, the better. Tuon did not seem to need either. Watching her, he realized how fortunate he had been the night he had taken her. Unarmed, she was deadly.</p>
<p class="tx">She slowed, waving her hands in front of her in a gentle pattern, then thrusting them quickly to the side. She breathed in and brought her arms to the other side, her entire body twisting.</p>
<p class="tx">Did he love her?</p>
<p class="tx">The question made Mat uncomfortable. It had been scratching at the edges of his mind for weeks now, like a rat trying to have at the grain. It was not the sort of question Matrim Cauthon was supposed to have to ask. Matrim Cauthon worried only about the girl on his knee and the next toss of the dice. Questions about matters like love were best left to Ogier who had time to sit and watch trees grow.</p>
<p class="tx">He had married her. That was an accident, was it not? The bloody snakes had told him he would. She had married him back. He still did not know why. Something to do with those omens she talked about? Their courtship had been more of a game than a romance. Mat liked games, and he always played to win. Tuon’s hand had been the prize. Now that he had it, what did he do with it?</p>
<p class="tx">She continued her forms, moving like a reed in the wind. A tilt this way, then a wave of motion that way. The Aiel called fighting a dance. What would they think of this? Tuon moved as gracefully as any Aiel. If battle were a dance, most of it was done to the music of a rowdy barroom. This was done to the swaying melody of a master singer.</p>
<p class="tx">Something moved over Tuon’s shoulder. Mat tensed, peering into that darkness. Ah, it was just a gardener. An ordinary-looking fellow with a cap on his head and freckled cheeks. Barely worth noticing. Mat put him out of his mind and leaned forward to take a better look at Tuon. He smiled at her beauty.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Why would a gardener be out at this time?</span> he thought. <span class="epub-i1">Must be a strange type of fellow.</span></p>
<p class="tx">Mat glanced at the man again, but had trouble picking him out. The gardener stepped between two members of the Deathwatch Guard. They did not seem to care. Mat should not either. They must trust the man … </p>
<p class="tx">Mat reached into his sleeve and freed a knife. He raised it without letting himself think about why. In doing so, his hand brushed one of the branches ever so softly.</p>
<p class="tx">Tuon’s eyes snapped open, and despite the dim light, she focused directly on Mat. She saw the knife in his hand, ready to throw.</p>
<p class="tx">Then she looked over her shoulder.</p>
<p class="tx">Mat threw, the knife reflecting blue light as it spun. It passed less than a finger’s width from Tuon’s chin, hitting the gardener in the shoulder as he raised a knife of his own. The man gasped, stumbling back. Mat would have preferred to take him in the throat, but he had not wanted to risk hitting Tuon.</p>
<p class="tx">Rather than doing the sensible thing and moving away, Tuon leaped for the man, hands shooting toward his throat. That made Mat smile. Unfortunately, the man had just enough time—and she was just enough off-balance—that he managed to push backward and scramble between the baffled Deathwatch Guards. Mat’s second dagger hit the ground behind the assassin’s heel as he vanished into the night.</p>
<p class="tx">A second later, three men—each weighing roughly the same as a small building—crashed down on top of Mat, slamming his face against the dry ground. One stepped on his wrist, and another ripped his <span class="epub-i1">ashandarei</span> away from him.</p>
<p class="tx">“Stop!” Tuon barked. “Release him! Go after the other one, you fools!”</p>
<p class="tx">“Other one, Majesty?” one of the guards asked. “There was no other one.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Then to whom does that blood belong?” Tuon asked, pointing at the dark stain on the ground that the assassin had left behind. “The Prince of the Ravens saw what you did not. Search the area!”</p>
<p class="tx">The Deathwatch Guards slowly climbed off Mat. He let out a groan. What did they feed these men? Bricks? He did not like being called “Highness,” but a little respect would have been nice here. If it had prevented him from being sat upon, that was.</p>
<p class="tx">He climbed to his feet, then held out his hand to a sheepish Deathwatch Guard. The fellow’s face had more scars than skin. He handed Mat the <span class="epub-i1">ashandarei</span>, then went off to help search the garden.</p>
<p class="tx">Tuon folded her arms, obviously unshaken. “You have chosen to delay your return to me, Matrim.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Delay my … I came to bloody warn you, not ‘return to’ you. I’m my own man.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You may pretend whatever you wish,” Tuon said, looking over her shoulder as the Deathwatch Guards beat at the shrubbery. “But you must not stay away. You are important to the Empire, and I have use for you.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Sounds delightful,” Mat grumbled.</p>
<p class="tx">“What was it?” Tuon asked softly. “I did not see the man until you drew attention. These guards are the best of the Empire. I have seen Daruo there catch an arrow in flight with his bare hand, and Barrin once stopped a man from breathing on me because he suspected an assassin whose mouth was filled with poisons. He was right.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It’s called a Gray Man,” Mat said, shivering. “There’s something freakishly ordinary about them—they’re hard to notice, hard to fixate upon.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Gray Man,” Tuon said idly. “More myths come to life. Like your Trollocs.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Trollocs are real, Tuon. Bloody—”</p>
<p class="tx">“Of course Trollocs are real,” she said. “Why wouldn’t I believe that they are?” She looked at him defiantly, as if daring him to mention the times she had called them myths. “This Gray Man appears to be real as well. There is no other explanation for why my guards let him pass.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I trust the Deathwatch Guards well enough,” Mat said, rubbing his shoulder where one of them had placed his knee. “But I don’t know, Tuon. General Galgan is trying to have you killed; he could be working with the enemy.”</p>
<p class="tx">“He’s not serious about having me killed,” Tuon said indifferently.</p>
<p class="tx">“Are you bloody insane?” Mat asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“Are you bloody stupid?” she asked. “He hired assassins from this land only, not true killers.”</p>
<p class="tx">“That Gray Man is from this land,” Mat pointed out.</p>
<p class="tx">That quieted her. “With whom did you gamble away that eye?”</p>
<p class="tx">Light! Was everyone going to ask him about it that way? “I went through a rough patch,” he said. “I made it through alive, which is all that matters.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Hmm. And did you save her? The one you went to rescue?”</p>
<p class="tx">“How did you know about that?”</p>
<p class="tx">She did not reply. “I have decided not to be jealous. You are fortunate. The missing eye suits you. Before, you were too pretty.”</p>
<p class="tx">Too pretty? Light. What did that mean?</p>
<p class="tx">“Good to see you, by the way,” Mat said. He waited a few moments. “Usually, when a fellow says something like that, it’s customary to tell them that you’re happy to see them as well.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I am the Empress now,” Tuon said. “I do not wait upon others, and do not find it ‘good’ that someone has returned. Their return is expected, as they serve me.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You know how to make a fellow feel loved. Well, I know how you feel about me.”</p>
<p class="tx">“And how is that?”</p>
<p class="tx">“You looked over your shoulder.”</p>
<p class="tx">She shook her head. “I had forgotten that you are supremely good at saying that which has no meaning, Matrim.”</p>
<p class="tx">“When you saw me,” Mat explained, “with a dagger in hand—as if to throw at you—you didn’t call for your guards. You didn’t fear I was here to kill you. You looked over your shoulder to see what I was aiming at. That’s the most loving gesture I think a man could receive from a woman. Unless you’d like to sit on my knee for a little while…”</p>
<p class="tx">She did not reply. Light, but she seemed cold. Was it all going to be different, now that she was the Empress? He could not have lost her already, could he?</p>
<p class="tx">Furyk Karede, the captain of the Deathwatch Guard, soon arrived with Musenge walking behind him. Karede looked like he had just found his house on fire. The other Deathwatch Guards saluted him and seemed to wither before him.</p>
<p class="tx">“Empress, my eyes are lowered,” Karede said, going down on his belly before her. “I will join those who failed you in spilling our lives before you as soon as a new squad has arrived to see to your protection.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Your lives are mine,” Tuon said, “and you do not end them unless I give you leave. This assassin was not of natural birth, but a creation of the Shadow. Your eyes are not lowered. The Prince of the Ravens will teach you how to spot this kind of creature, so you will not be so surprised again.”</p>
<p class="tx">Mat was fairly certain that Gray Men <span class="epub-i1">were</span> of natural birth, but then, so were Trollocs and Fades. It did not seem appropriate to point this out to Tuon. Besides, something else in her orders drew his attention.</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m going to do what, now?” Mat asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“Teach them,” Tuon said softly. “You are Prince of the Ravens. This will be part of your duties.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We need to talk about that,” Mat said. “Everyone calling me ‘Highness’ is not going to do, Tuon. It just won’t.”</p>
<p class="tx">She did not reply. She waited as the search proceeded, and made no move to retreat to the palace.</p>
<p class="tx">Finally, Karede approached again. “Highest One, there is no sign of the thing in the gardens, but one of my men has found blood on the wall. I suspect the assassin fled into the city.”</p>
<p class="tx">“He is unlikely to try again tonight,” Tuon said, “while we are alerted. Do not spread news of this to the common soldiers or guards. Inform my Voice that our ruse has stopped being effective, and that we will need to consider a new one.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes, Empress,” Karede said, bowing low again.</p>
<p class="tx">“For now,” Tuon said, “clear out and secure the perimeter. I will be spending time with my consort, who has requested that I ‘make him feel loved.’ ”</p>
<p class="tx">“That’s not exactly—” Mat said as the members of the Deathwatch Guard faded into the darkness.</p>
<p class="tx">Tuon studied Mat for a moment, then began to disrobe.</p>
<p class="tx">“Light!” Mat said. “You <span class="epub-i1">meant</span> it?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m not going to sit on your knee,” Tuon said, pulling one arm out of her robe, exposing her breasts, “though I may allow you to sit on mine. Tonight, you have saved my life. That will earn you special privilege. It—”</p>
<p class="tx">She cut off as Mat grabbed her and kissed her. She was tense with surprise. <span class="epub-i1">In the bloody garden,</span> he thought. <span class="epub-i1">With soldiers standing all about, well within earshot.</span> Well, if she expected Matrim Cauthon to be shy, she had a surprise coming.</p>
<p class="tx">He released her lips from the kiss. Her body was pressed against his, and he was pleased to find her breathless.</p>
<p class="tx">“I won’t be your toy,” Mat said sternly. “I won’t have it, Tuon. If you intend it to be that way, I will leave. Mark me. Sometimes, I do play the fool. With Tylin, I did for sure. I won’t have that with you.”</p>
<p class="tx">She reached up and touched his face, surprisingly tender. “I would not have said the words I did if I had found in you only a toy. A man missing an eye is no toy anyway. You have known battle; everyone who sees you now will know that. They will not mistake you for a fool, and I have no use for a toy. I shall have a prince instead.”</p>
<p class="tx">“And do you love me?” he asked, forcing the words out.</p>
<p class="tx">“An empress does not love,” she said. “I am sorry. I am with you because the omens state it so, and so with you I will bring the Seanchan an heir.”</p>
<p class="tx">Mat had a sinking feeling.</p>
<p class="tx">“However,” Tuon said. “Perhaps I can admit that it is … good to see you.”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Well,</span> Mat thought, <span class="epub-i1">guess I can take that. For now.</span></p>
<p class="tx">He kissed her again.</p>
