<p class="ct"><span class="epub-i">A Practiced Grin</span></p>
<p class="tni">Olver missed Wind. Bela—the stout, shaggy mare he now rode—wasn’t bad, really. She was just slow. Olver knew this because he kept trying to nudge her forward, but she continued plodding along behind the other horses. Nothing he did could make her go any faster. Olver wanted to ride like a storm. Instead, he rode like a sturdy log in a placid river.</p>
<p class="tx">He wiped his brow. The Blight was pretty scary, and the others—most of them didn’t have horses—walked as if each step was going to bring a thousand Trollocs down on them. The rest of the caravan spoke in hushed voices, and they looked at the hillsides with suspicion.</p>
<p class="tx">They passed a group of withered trees, with sap leaking from open sores in the bark. That sap looked too red. Almost like blood. Nearby, one of the caravan drivers stepped up to inspect it.</p>
<p class="tx">Vines snapped down from the limbs above—vines that looked brown and dead, yet moved like snakes. Before Olver could scream, the caravan driver was hanging, dead, from the upper branches of the tree.</p>
<p class="tx">The entire line of people froze in place, horrified. Above, the tree actually <span class="epub-i1">pulled</span> the dead man into itself through a split in the bark. Ingesting him. Maybe that sap <span class="epub-i1">was</span> blood.</p>
<p class="tx">Olver looked on, horrified.</p>
<p class="tx">“Steady,” Lady Faile said, a slight tremor in her voice. “I’ve told you, don’t draw close to plants! Don’t touch anything.”</p>
<p class="tx">They moved on, a solemn bunch. Sandip, riding nearby, muttered to himself. “That’s the fifteenth one. Fifteen men, dead in a few days. Light! We’re never going to survive this!”</p>
<p class="tx">If only it were Trollocs! Olver couldn’t fight trees and insects. Who could? But Trollocs, those he’d be able to fight. Olver had his knife, and he’d learned a few things about using it from Harnan and Silvic. Olver wasn’t that tall, but he figured that would make Trollocs underestimate him. He could lunge low and go for their vitals before they knew what was happening.</p>
<p class="tx">He told himself this to keep his hands from shaking as he kicked Bela, hoping to move up by Lady Faile. In the distance, he heard a screeching sound, like something dying in a horrible way. Olver shivered. He’d heard that same sound earlier in the day. Did it sound closer now?</p>
<p class="tx">Setalle gave him a worried glance as he neared the front. The others tried everything they could to keep him from danger. He steeled himself, ignoring that horrid screeching off in the distance. Everyone thought Olver was fragile, but he wasn’t. They hadn’t seen what he had, growing up. In truth, he didn’t like thinking about those times. It seemed as if he’d lived three lives. One before his parents died, one when he’d been alone and now this one.</p>
<p class="tx">Anyway, he was used to fighting people bigger than he was. It was the Last Battle. They kept saying everyone would be needed. Well, why not him? When the Trollocs came, the first thing he’d do was climb down off this slow mount. He could <span class="epub-i1">stroll</span> faster than this animal could gallop! Well, the Aiel didn’t need horses. Olver hadn’t gone to train with them yet, but he would. He had it planned out. He hated all Aiel, but mostly the Shaido, and he would need to learn their secrets if he was going to kill them.</p>
<p class="tx">He’d go among them and demand to be trained. They’d take him in, and would treat him poorly, but eventually they’d respect him and let him train with their warriors. There were stories about that. It was how things happened.</p>
<p class="tx">After he knew their secrets, he’d go to the Snakes and Foxes and receive answers on how to locate the Shaido who had murdered his father. From there, tracking and killing them would be a quest worthy of its own story.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">I’ll take Noal,</span> he thought. <span class="epub-i1">He’s been everywhere. He can be my guide. He … </span></p>
<p class="tx">Noal was dead.</p>
<p class="tx">Sweat crawled down the side of Olver’s face as he stared at the rocky path ahead. They passed more of those terrible trees, and now everyone gave them a wide berth. Beside the path, though, one of the men pointed out a large patch of that killing mud. It looked brown and thick, and Olver spotted several bones peeking out.</p>
<p class="tx">This place was horrible!</p>
<p class="tx">He wished Noal were here. Noal had gone everywhere, seen everything. He’d know how to get them out of this place. But Noal was gone. Olver had only heard the news recently, filtered through things that the Lady Moiraine had shared about what happened at the Tower of Ghenjei.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Everyone’s dying,</span> Olver thought, eyes still forward. <span class="epub-i1">Everyone … </span></p>
<p class="tx">Mat had run off to the Seanchan, Talmanes to fight alongside Queen Elayne. One by one, everyone in this group was being eaten by trees, mud or monsters.</p>
<p class="tx">Why did they all leave Olver alone?</p>
<p class="tx">He rubbed at his bracelet. Noal had given it to him, shortly before leaving. Woven of rough fibers, it was of a type warriors wore in a faraway land, so Noal had told him. It was the mark of a man who had seen battle and lived.</p>
<p class="tx">Noal … dead. Would Mat die, too?</p>
<p class="tx">Olver felt hot, tired and very frightened. He nudged Bela forward, and fortunately she obeyed, trotting a little faster up the slope so Olver moved up the line. They’d abandoned the wagons, then left for some place called the Blasted Lands, which required them to climb some foothills. In the morning, they’d entered a pass between the mountains. Though he felt warm, the air <span class="epub-i1">was</span> getting cooler as they climbed. He didn’t mind that at all. It still smelled awful, though. Like rotting corpses.</p>
<p class="tx">Their group had started with fifty soldiers and almost half as many wagon drivers and workers. There were also a handful of others like Olver, Setalle and the half-dozen members of Lady Faile’s bodyguard.</p>
<p class="tx">So far, they’d lost fifteen people to hazards of the Blight, including five killed by some horrible three-eyed things that had attacked the camp yesterday morning. He’d overheard Lady Faile saying that she considered them lucky to have lost only fifteen so far, that it could have been worse.</p>
<p class="tx">It didn’t seem lucky to Olver. This place was awful and he wanted to be out of it. The Waste wouldn’t be as bad as this, would it? <span class="epub-i1">Cha Faile’s</span> men and women acted like Aiel. A little bit like Aiel. Maybe they’d done as Olver wanted to, and trained in the Waste. He’d have to ask them.</p>
<p class="tx">He rode on for another half-hour or so. Eventually, he coaxed Bela up to the front of the line. Lady Faile’s brilliant black mare looked fast. Why couldn’t Olver have been given a horse like that one?</p>
<p class="tx">Faile had Mat’s chest tied to the back of her horse. At first, Olver had been pleased with that, as he figured Mat would want that tabac pretty badly. Mat always complained about not having good tabac. Then Olver had heard Faile explaining to someone else that the chest had simply been a convenient place to stow some of her things. Had she thrown away the tabac? Mat wouldn’t like that.</p>
<p class="tx">Faile looked at him, and Olver grinned, giving it as much confidence as he could. It wouldn’t do for her to see how scared he was.</p>
<p class="tx">Most women liked his grin. He’d been practicing it, though he didn’t use Mat’s grin as a model. Mat’s always made him look guilty. You learned grins when you were forced to fend for yourself, and Olver needed one that made him seem innocent. And he <span class="epub-i1">was</span> innocent. Mostly.</p>
<p class="tx">Faile did not smile back. Olver figured that she was pretty good to look at, despite that nose. She wasn’t very soft, though. Bloody ashes, but she had a glare that could rust good iron.</p>
<p class="tx">Faile rode between Aravine and Vanin. Though they spoke softly, Olver could hear what they were saying. He made sure to stare in the other direction, so they’d think he wasn’t eavesdropping. And he wasn’t. He just wanted to be out of the trail dust of the other horses.</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes,” Vanin was whispering. “It may not seem it, but we’re close to the Blasted Lands. Burn my own mother, I can’t believe we’re going there. But do you feel the air? It’s getting cooler. We haven’t seen anything <span class="epub-i1">really</span> nasty since those three-eyed things yesterday morning.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We are close,” Aravine agreed. “Soon, we will be near the Dark One, in a land where nothing grows, corrupted or not, where there is no life, not even the nastier things from the Blight.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I suppose that should be a comfort.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Not really,” Vanin said, wiping his brow. “Because the Shadowspawn up here are more dangerous. If we survive, it will be because there’s a bloody war going on. The Shadowspawn are all locked in battle. If we’re lucky, the Blasted Lands, except right around Shayol Ghul, will be as empty as a man’s purse after a deal with the bloody Sea Folk. Pardon my language, my Lady.”</p>
<p class="tx">Olver squinted at the approaching mountain peak.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">That’s where the bloody Dark One lives,</span> Olver thought. <span class="epub-i1">And that’s probably where Mat is, not Merrilor.</span> Mat talked about staying away from danger, but he always found his way to it anyway. Olver figured that Mat was just trying to be humble, but was bad at it. Why else would you say you don’t want to be a hero, then always bloody end up charging right into danger?</p>
<p class="tx">“And this path?” Faile asked Vanin. “You said there might have been traffic here recently. Wouldn’t that indicate that this place is far from as empty as you so colorfully described?”</p>
<p class="tx">Vanin grunted. “It does look used.”</p>
<p class="tx">“So someone has been moving wagons through the area,” Aravine said. “I don’t know if that is a good sign or a bad one.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t think there are <span class="epub-i1">any</span> good signs up here,” Vanin said. “Maybe we should just pick someplace nearby and hole up, waiting.” He sighed, wiping his brow again, though Olver didn’t see why. It was growing pretty cold—he could tell, even through the course of the day. And there seemed to be fewer plants, too. He was just fine with that.</p>
<p class="tx">He glanced over his shoulder at the stand of trees that had taken that poor man’s life. There didn’t seem to be any others like it nearby, particularly not ahead of them along the path.</p>
<p class="tx">“We can’t afford to wait, Vanin,” Faile said. “I intend to get back to Merrilor, one way or another. The Dragon Reborn will be fighting at Thakan’dar. That’s where we need to go to get out of this forsaken place.”</p>
<p class="tx">Vanin groaned, but Olver smiled. He <span class="epub-i1">would</span> find his way to Mat, and show how dangerous he could be in battle. Then … </p>
<p class="tx">Well, then maybe Mat wouldn’t leave him like the others had. That would be good, as Olver was going to need Mat’s help tracking down those Shaido. After all he’d learned training with the Band, he was certain nobody would push him around. And nobody would take those he loved from him ever again.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">“There are accounts in the archives that explain what we saw.” Cadsuane picked up her cup of tea to warm her hands.</p>
<p class="tx">The Aiel girl, Aviendha, sat on the floor of the tent. <span class="epub-i1">What I wouldn’t give to have that one in the Tower,</span> Cadsuane thought. These Wise Ones … they had fight to them. Real bite, like the best of the women in the White Tower.</p>
<p class="tx">Cadsuane was increasingly convinced that the Shadow for years had been carrying out a complex plan to undermine the White Tower. It went deeper than Siuan Sanche’s unfortunate unseating and Elaida’s reign. It might be decades, centuries, before they understood the extent of the Shadow’s planning. However, the sheer number of Black sisters—hundreds, not the few dozen Cadsuane had guessed—shouted of what had happened.</p>
<p class="tx">For now, Cadsuane had to work with what she had. That included these Wise Ones, poorly trained in using weaves but never lacking in grit. Useful. Like Sorilea, despite her weakness in the One Power, who sat farther back in the tent, watching.</p>
<p class="tx">“I have made some inquiries, child,” Cadsuane said to Aviendha. “What this woman does is <span class="epub-i1">indeed</span> Traveling. However, the only fragments of documents mentioning it date back to the War of Power.”</p>
<p class="tx">Aviendha frowned. “I saw no weaves, Cadsuane Sedai.”</p>
<p class="tx">Cadsuane masked a smile at the respectful tone. The al’Thor boy had put this girl in command—and, in truth, better her than some others. However, he <span class="epub-i1">should</span> have chosen Cadsuane, and Aviendha likely knew it.</p>
<p class="tx">“That is because the woman was not weaving the One Power,” Cadsuane replied.</p>
<p class="tx">“What else would it be?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Do you know why the Dark One was originally freed?”</p>
<p class="tx">Aviendha looked as if remembering something. “Ah … yes. Then they are channeling the Dark One’s power?”</p>
<p class="tx">“It is called the True Power,” Cadsuane said. “The accounts say that Traveling by True Power works in the way you have seen this woman move. Few saw it happen. The Dark One was miserly with his essence during the War of Power, and only the most favored were granted access. I surmise from this fact that this is <span class="epub-i1">most definitely</span> one of the Forsaken. From your description of what she did to poor Sarene, I would suspect it is Graendal.”</p>
<p class="tx">“The stories never mentioned Graendal being so ugly,” Sorilea said softly.</p>
<p class="tx">“If you were one of the Forsaken, easily recognized by description, would you not wish to change your appearance to remain unknown?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Perhaps,” Sorilea said. “But then I would not use this … True Power, as you name it. That would defeat the purpose of my disguise.”</p>
<p class="tx">“From what Aviendha has told us,” Cadsuane noted, “the woman did not have much of a choice. She had to escape quickly.”</p>
<p class="tx">Cadsuane and Sorilea met eyes, and each nodded in agreement. They would hunt this Forsaken, the two of them.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">I won’t have you dying on me now, boy,</span> Cadsuane thought, glancing over her shoulder toward where al’Thor, Nynaeve and Moiraine continued their work. Every channeler in the camp could feel that pulsing. <span class="epub-i1">At least, not until you’ve done what you need to do.</span> Cadsuane had expected the Forsaken to be here. It was why she’d come to this battlefront.</p>
<p class="tx">Wind shook the tent, chilling Cadsuane down deep. This place was awful, even when the battle slowed. The dread that hung here was like that of a funeral for a child. It stifled laughter, killed smiles. The Dark One watched. Light, but it would be good to leave this place.</p>
<p class="tx">Aviendha drank her tea. The woman still looked haunted, although she had obviously lost allies in battle before.</p>
<p class="tx">“I left them to die,” she whispered.</p>
<p class="tx">“Phaw,” Cadsuane said to her. “You are not to blame for what one of the Forsaken did, child.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You don’t understand,” Aviendha said. “We were in a circle, and they tried to break free—I felt them—but I didn’t know what was happening. I held on to their Power, and so they couldn’t fight her. I left them helpless.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Well, from now on don’t leave those in your circle behind,” Cadsuane said briskly. “You could not have known what would happen.”</p>
<p class="tx">“If you suspect this one is nearby, Aviendha,” Sorilea said, “you will send word to Cadsuane, me or Amys. There is no shame in admitting that another is too strong to face alone. We will defeat this woman together and protect the <span class="epub-i1">Car’a’carn</span>.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Very well,” Aviendha said. “But you will do the same for me. All of you.”</p>
<p class="tx">She waited. Cadsuane reluctantly agreed, as did Sorilea.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Faile crouched in a dark tent. The air had grown even colder, now that they were close to Thakan’dar. She ran her thumb along the hilt of her knife, breathing in slowly and evenly, then releasing the breath in the same manner. She stared at the tent flaps, unblinking.</p>
<p class="tx">She’d placed the Horn’s chest there with one corner sticking out into the night. She felt more alone here on the border of the Blasted Lands—surrounded by supposed allies—than she had in the Shaido camp.</p>
<p class="tx">Two nights ago, she’d been called out of her tent to inspect some odd tracks that had worried the men. They hadn’t lost anyone since drawing so close to the Blasted Lands—that part of the plan was working—but tensions were still high. She’d been gone only a few minutes, but when she’d returned, the Horn’s chest in her tent had been moved just slightly.</p>
<p class="tx">Someone had tried to open it. <span class="epub-i1">Light</span>. Fortunately, they hadn’t managed to break the lock, and the Horn had still been there when she’d looked.</p>
<p class="tx">The traitor could be anyone. One of the Redarms, a wagon driver, a member of <span class="epub-i1">Cha Faile</span>. Faile had spent the past two nights being extra—even obviously—vigilant with the chest to frustrate the thief. Then, tonight, she’d complained of a headache and allowed Setalle to fix her some tea to help her sleep. She’d brought the tea back to her tent, had not taken a sip and now crouched, waiting.</p>
<p class="tx">The chest’s corner would be obvious, poking out into the night. Would they try again? As a precaution, she’d removed the Horn from the chest and taken it when she went out to answer the call of nature. She’d hidden it there in a cubby of rock and, upon returning, had put <span class="epub-i1">Cha Faile</span> on patrol duty for the night, away from her tent. They had not liked leaving her unguarded, but Faile had made it clear that she was worried about tensions among the men.</p>
<p class="tx">That would be enough. Light, let it be enough.</p>
<p class="tx">Hours passed with Faile crouched in that same position, ready to leap up and call the alarm the moment someone tried to enter her tent. Surely they would try again tonight, when she was supposedly ill.</p>
<p class="tx">Nothing. Her muscles ached, but she didn’t move. The thief could be out there, in the dark, waiting. Wondering if this was the right moment to strike, to grab the Horn and run off to his or her masters. It—</p>
<p class="tx">A scream shattered the night.</p>
<p class="tx">Faile wavered. A distraction?</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">That scream,</span> she thought, judging the direction. <span class="epub-i1">It came … from just west of here.</span></p>
<p class="tx">Near where she’d hidden the Horn. Faile cursed, making a snap decision. The chest was empty. If she took the bait and it really was just a distraction, then she would not lose anything. If, on the other hand, the thief had anticipated her … She darted from the tent as others scrambled from bedrolls. Members of <span class="epub-i1">Cha Faile</span> raced through the camp. The yell came again.</p>
<p class="tx">It was accompanied by a haunting screech, a type that had been following them in the distance.</p>
<p class="tx">She crashed through some thin, Blight-stained weeds. Running through them was a foolish move in a place where a twig could kill, but she was not thinking clearly.</p>
<p class="tx">She arrived first on the scene, reaching the area where she’d hidden the Horn. There stood not only Vanin, but Harnan as well. Vanin clutched the Horn of Valere in thick arms while Harnan fought against some kind of beast with dark fur, shouting and swinging his sword.</p>
<p class="tx">Vanin looked at Faile and grew as pale as a Whitecloak’s shirt.</p>
<p class="tx">“Thief!” Faile shouted. “Stop him! He has stolen the Horn of Valere!”</p>
<p class="tx">Vanin cried out, tossing the Horn as if it had bitten him, then dashing away. Light, but he could move quickly for one of his bulk! He grabbed Harnan by the shoulder, pulling him to the side as the beast screamed that haunting wail.</p>
<p class="tx">Other roars came in the distance. Faile skidded to the ground, grabbing the Horn and clutching it close. These men were no common thieves. They had not only seen through her plan, but anticipated exactly where she’d hidden the Horn. She felt like a farmgirl who had just fallen for a townsman’s three-cup scam.</p>
<p class="tx">Those who had come running with her stood stunned, either by the sight of the Horn or the monster. The creature screeched—it looked like some kind of bear with too many arms, though it was larger than any bear Faile had seen. She stumbled to her feet. There was no time to look for the thieves as the beast smashed its way into Faile’s guards. It ripped the head off a member of <span class="epub-i1">Cha Faile,</span> screeching.</p>
<p class="tx">Faile shouted, flinging a knife at the thing as Arrela hacked at one of its shoulders with her sword. Just then, a <span class="epub-i1">second</span> beast came lumbering over the rocks next to Faile.</p>
<p class="tx">She cursed, leaping away, flinging a knife. She hit it—or, at least, the thing cried out in what sounded like anger and pain. As Mandevwin rode up on horseback, bearing a torch, the light revealed that the horrible things had faces like those of insects, with a multitude of fanglike teeth. Faile’s knife protruded from one bulblike eye.</p>
<p class="tx">“Protect the lady!” Mandevwin yelled, throwing spears to nearby Redarms, who rammed them at the first monster, pushing it back from Arrela—who scrambled away, bleeding. The woman hadn’t lost her sword, though.</p>
<p class="tx">Faile fell back as <span class="epub-i1">Cha Faile</span> organized around her, then looked down at what she held. The Horn of Valere itself, pulled from the sack in which she’d hidden it. She could blow it … </p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">No,</span> she thought. <span class="epub-i1">It is bound to Cauthon.</span> To her, it would be just an ordinary horn.</p>
<p class="tx">“Steady!” Mandevwin said, dancing his warhorse back as one of the beasts lunged at it. “Verdin, Laandon, we need more spears! Go! The things fight like boars. Draw them forward, impale them!”</p>
<p class="tx">The tactic worked on one of the monsters, but as Mandevwin yelled, the other one charged at him and grabbed his horse by the neck. The beast brushed aside soldiers who tried to strike, and Mandevwin crashed to the ground, groaning.</p>
<p class="tx">Still clutching the Horn, Faile dashed past where a group of Redarms had managed to skewer the other beast. She grabbed a freshly lit torch and threw it at the other monster, lighting the fur on its back. The thing bellowed as fire raced up its spine, the fur burning like dry tinder. It dropped Mandevwin’s dead horse, the head ripped nearly free, as it thrashed, yelling and howling.</p>
<p class="tx">“Grab the wounded!” Faile ordered. She took a member of the Band by the arm. “See to Mandevwin!”</p>
<p class="tx">The man looked down at the Horn she held, eyes wide, then shook himself and nodded, calling for two others to help him lift the man.</p>
<p class="tx">“My Lady?” Aravine asked, standing near the bushes behind. “What is happening?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Two Redarms tried to steal what I have been carrying,” Faile said. “Now we’re going to ride away into the night.”</p>
<p class="tx">“But—”</p>
<p class="tx">“Listen!” Faile said, pointing into the darkness.</p>
<p class="tx">Distantly, a dozen different screeches sounded, responding to the cries of the dying beast.</p>
<p class="tx">“The screams will draw further horrors, as will the scent of spilled blood. We go. If we can get deeply enough into the Blasted Lands tonight, we might be safe. Rouse the camp and get the wounded onto horses. Prepare everyone else for a forced quick march. Quickly!”</p>
<p class="tx">Aravine nodded, scrambling off. Faile spared a glance in the direction Harnan and Vanin had gone. She longed to hunt them down, but tracking them in the night would require them to move slowly, and that would mean death this night. Besides, who knew what resources a pair of Darkfriends had access to?</p>
<p class="tx">They would flee. And Light, she hoped that she hadn’t been deceived more than it seemed. If Vanin had somehow known to prepare a dummy Horn, a replica to drop and leave for Faile to “rescue” as he fled … </p>
<p class="tx">She’d never know. She’d reach the Last Battle with a fake Horn, and perhaps doom them all. That possibility haunted her as the caravan’s members hastily moved into the darkness, hoping in Light and luck to escape the dangers of the night.</p>
