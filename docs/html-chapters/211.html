<p class="para10"><strong class="calibre2">A Note on Dates in This Glossary</strong>. Three systems of recording dates have been in general use since the Breaking of the World. The first recorded years After the Breaking (AB). Since the years of the Breaking and immediately after were years of almost total chaos, and since this calendar was adopted a good hundred years after the end of the Breaking, its starting point was arbitrarily assigned. At the end of the Trolloc Wars many records had been lost, so much so that there was argument about the exact year under the old system. A new calendar was therefore established, dating from the end of the Wars and celebrating the supposed freedom of the world from the Trolloc threat. This second calendar recorded each year as Free Year (FY). After the disruption, death, and destruction caused by the War of the Hundred Years, a third calendar came into being. This calendar, of the New Era (NE), is currently in use.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Accepted, the:</strong> Young women in training to be Aes Sedai who have reached a certain level of power and passed certain tests. It normally takes five to ten years to be raised from novice to the Accepted. Accepted are somewhat less confined by rules than novices, and are allowed to choose their own areas of study, within limits. An Accepted has the right to wear a Great Serpent ring, but only on the third finger of her left hand. When an Accepted is raised to Aes Sedai, she chooses <a id="page_588" class="calibre3"/>her Ajah, gains the right to wear the shawl, and may wear the ring on any finger or not at all if circumstances warrant.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Aes Sedai</strong> (EYEZ seh-DEYE): Wielders of the One Power. Since the Time of Madness, all surviving Aes Sedai are women. Widely distrusted and feared, even hated, they are blamed by many for the Breaking of the World, and are thought to meddle in the affairs of nations. At the same time, few rulers will be without an Aes Sedai advisor, even in lands where the existence of such a connection must be kept secret. After some years of channeling the One Power, Aes Sedai take on an ageless quality, so that an Aes Sedai who is old enough to be a grandmother may show no signs of age except perhaps a few gray hairs. <strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">See also</em></strong> Ajah; Amyrlin Seat; Time of Madness.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Age of Legends:</strong> The Age ended by the War of the Shadow and the Breaking of the World. A time when Aes Sedai performed wonders now only dreamed of. <strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">See also</em></strong> Wheel of Time; Breaking of the World; War of the Shadow.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Aiel</strong> (eye-EEL): The people of the Aiel Waste. Fierce and hardy. Also called Aielmen. They veil their faces before they kill, giving rise to the saying “acting like a black-veiled Aiel” to describe someone who is being violent. Deadly warriors with any weapon or with nothing but their bare hands, they will not touch a sword. Their pipers play them into battle with the music of dances, and Aielmen call battle “the dance,” and “the dance of spears.” <strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">See also</em></strong> Aiel warrior societies; Aiel Waste.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Aiel War, the:</strong> (976–78 NE) When King Laman of Cairhien cut down Avendoraldera, several clans of the Aiel crossed the Spine of the World. They looted and burned the capital city of Cairhien as well as many other cities and towns, and the conflict extended into Andor and Tear. The conventional view is that the Aiel were finally defeated at the Battle of the Shining Walls, before Tar Valon, but in fact, Laman was killed in that battle, and having done what they had come for, the Aiel recrossed the Spine. <strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">See also</em></strong> <em class="calibre18">Avendoraldera</em>; Cairhien.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Aiel warrior societies:</strong> Aiel warriors are all members of one of the warrior societies, such as the Stone Dogs (<em class="calibre18">Shae’en M’taal</em>), the Red Shields (<em class="calibre18">Aethan Dor</em>), or the Maidens of the Spear (<em class="calibre18">Far Dareis Mai</em>). Each society has its own customs, and sometimes specific duties. For example, Red Shields act as police. Stone Dogs often vow not to retreat once battle has been joined, and will die to the last man if necessary to fulfill this vow. The clans of the Aiel—among them the Goshien, Reyn, Shaarad, and Taardad Aiel—frequently fight among themselves, but members of the <a id="page_589" class="calibre3"/>same society will not fight each other even if their clans are doing so. In this way, there are always lines of contact between the clans even when they are in open warfare. <strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">See also</em></strong> Aiel; Aiel Waste; <em class="calibre18">Far Dareis Mai</em>.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Aiel Waste:</strong> The harsh, rugged, and all-but-waterless land east of the Spine of the World. Called the Three-fold Land by the Aiel. Few outsiders go there, not only because water is almost impossible to find for one not born there, but because the Aiel consider themselves at war with all other peoples and do not welcome strangers. Only peddlers, gleemen, and the Tuatha’an are allowed safe entry, and contact even with them is limited. No maps of the Waste itself are known to exist.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Ajah</strong> (AH-jah): Societies among the Aes Sedai to which all Aes Sedai except the Amyrlin Seat belong. They are designated by colors: Blue, Red, White, Green, Brown, Yellow, and Gray. Each follows a specific philosophy of the use of the One Power and the purposes of the Aes Sedai. For example, the Red Ajah bends all its energies to finding men who are attempting to wield the Power, and to gentling them. The Brown Ajah, on the other hand, forsakes involvement with the mundane world and dedicates itself to seeking knowledge, while the White Ajah, largely eschewing both the world and the value of worldly knowledge, devotes itself to questions of philosophy and truth. The Green Ajah (called the Battle Ajah during the Trolloc Wars) holds itself ready to counter any new Dreadlords when Tarmon Gai’don comes. There are rumors of a Black Ajah, dedicated to serving the Dark One.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Alanna Mosvani</strong> (ah-LAN-nah mos-VANH-nie): An Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Amyrlin Seat</strong> (AHM-ehr-lin SEAT): (1) Leader of the Aes Sedai. Elected for life by the Hall of the Tower, the highest council of the Aes Sedai, which consists of three representatives (called Sitters, as in “a Sitter for the Green”) from each of the seven Ajahs. The Amyrlin Seat has, theoretically at least, almost supreme authority among the Aes Sedai, and <a id="page_590" class="calibre3"/>ranks socially as the equal of a king or queen. A slightly less formal usage is simply the Amyrlin. (2) The throne on which the leader of the Aes Sedai sits.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Anaiya</strong> (ah-NYE-yah): An Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Breaking of the World, the:</strong> During the Time of Madness, male Aes Sedai who had gone insane, and who could wield the One Power to a degree now unknown, changed the face of the earth. They caused great earthquakes, leveled old mountain ranges and raised new mountains, lifted dry land where seas had been and made the ocean rush in where dry land had been. Many parts of the world were completely depopulated, and the survivors were scattered like dust on the wind. This destruction is remembered in stories, legends, and history as the Breaking of the World. <strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">See also</em></strong> Time of Madness; Hundred Companions, the.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Byar, Jaret</strong> (BY-ahr, JAH-ret): An officer of the Children of the Light.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Cairhien</strong> (KEYE-ree-EHN): Both a nation along the Spine of the World and the capital city of that nation. The city was burned and looted during the Aiel War, as were many other towns and villages. The consequent abandonment of farmland near the Spine of the World made necessary the importation of great quantities of grain. The assassination of King Galldrian (998 NE) has resulted in a civil war among the noble Houses for succession to the Sun Throne, in the disruption of grain shipments, and in famine. The sign of Cairhien is a many-rayed golden sun rising from the bottom of a field of sky blue.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">Callandor</em></strong> (CAH-lahn-DOOR): The Sword That Is Not a Sword, the Sword That Cannot Be Touched. A crystal sword held in the Stone of Tear, in the chamber called the Heart of the Stone. No hand can touch it except that of the Dragon Reborn. According to the Prophecies of the Dragon, one of the major signs of the Dragon’s Rebirth and the approach of Tarmon Gai’don will be that the Dragon Reborn has taken <em class="calibre18">Callandor</em>.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Cauthon, Mat</strong> (CAW-thon, MAT): A young man from Emond’s Field in the Two Rivers. Full name: Matrim (MAT-trim) Cauthon.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Children of the Light:</strong> A society holding strict ascetic beliefs, dedicated to the defeat of the Dark One and the destruction of all Darkfriends. Founded during the War of the Hundred Years by Lothair Mantelar (LOH-thayr MAHN-tee-LAHR) to proselytize against an increase in <a id="page_592" class="calibre3"/>the numbers of Darkfriends, they evolved during the war into a completely military organization. They are extremely rigid in their beliefs, and certain that only they know the truth and the right. They hate Aes Sedai, considering them, and any who support or befriend them, Darkfriends. They are known disparagingly as Whitecloaks. Their sign is a golden sunburst on a field of white. <strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">See also</em></strong> Questioners.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Chronicles, Keeper of the:</strong> Second in authority to the Amyrlin Seat among the Aes Sedai, she also acts as secretary to the Amyrlin. Chosen for life by the Hall of the Tower, and usually of the same Ajah as the Amyrlin. <strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">See also</em></strong> Amyrlin Seat; Ajah.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Council of Nine:</strong> In Illian, a council of nine Lords who are supposed to advise the King, but who historically contend with him for power. Both the King and the Nine often must contend with the Assemblage, as well.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">cuendillar</em></strong> (CWAIN-deh-yar): <em class="calibre18">See</em> heartstone.</p>
<p class="para10"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">Daes Dae’mar</em></strong> (DAH-ess day-MAR): The Great Game, also known as the Game of Houses. Name given the scheming, plots, and manipulations for advantage by the noble Houses. Great value is given to subtlety, to aiming at one thing while seeming to aim at another, and to achieving ends with the least visible effort.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Damodred, Lord Galadedrid</strong> (DAHM-oh-drehd, gah-LAHD-eh-drihd): Half brother to Elayne and Gawyn. His sign is a winged silver sword, point down.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Darkfriends:</strong> Those who follow the Dark One and believe they will gain great power and rewards, and even immortality, when he is freed from his prison.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Darkhounds:</strong> <em class="calibre18">See</em> Wild Hunt.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Dark One:</strong> Most common name, used in every land, for Shai’tan. The source of evil, antithesis of the Creator. Imprisoned by the Creator in Shayol Ghul at the moment of Creation. The attempt to free him from that prison brought about the War of the Shadow, the tainting of <em class="calibre18">saidin</em>, the Breaking of the World, and the end of the Age of Legends.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Dark One, naming the:</strong> Saying the true name of the Dark One (Shai’tan) draws his attention, inevitably bringing ill fortune at best, disaster at worst. For that reason, many euphemisms are used, among them the Dark One, Father of Lies, Sightblinder, Lord of the Grave, Shepherd of the Night, Hearstbane, Soulsbane, Heartfang, Old Grim, Grassburner, and Leafblighter. Darkfriends call him the Great Lord of the Dark. <a id="page_593" class="calibre3"/>Someone who seems to be inviting ill fortune is often said to be “naming the Dark One.”</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Daughter-Heir:</strong> Title of the heir to the throne of Andor. The eldest daughter of the Queen succeeds her mother on the throne. Without a surviving daughter, the throne goes to the nearest female blood relation of the Queen.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Daughter of the Night:</strong> <em class="calibre18">See</em> Lanfear.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Dragon, false:</strong> Occasionally men claim to be the Dragon Reborn, and sometimes one of these men gains following enough to require an army to put it down. Some have begun wars that involved many nations. Over the centuries most of these have been men unable to channel the One Power, but a few could do so. All, however, either disappeared or were captured or killed without fulfilling any of the Prophecies concerning the Rebirth of the Dragon. These men are called false Dragons. Among those who could channel, the most powerful were Raolin Darksbane (335–36 AB), Yurian Stonebow (circa 1300–1308 AB), Davian (FY 351), Guaire Amalasan (FY 939–43), and Logain (997 NE). <strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">See also</em></strong> Dragon Reborn.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Dragon, Prophecies of the:</strong> Little known and seldom spoken of, the Prophecies, given in <em class="calibre18">The Karaethon Cycle</em>, foretell that the Dark One will be freed again to touch the world. And that Lews Therin Telamon, the Dragon, Breaker of the World, will be reborn to fight Tarmon Gai’don, the Last Battle against the Shadow. <strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">See also</em></strong> Dragon, the.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Dragon, the:</strong> The name by which Lews Therin Telamon was known during the War of the Shadow. In the madness that overtook all male Aes Sedai, Lews Therin killed every living person who carried any of his blood, as well as everyone he loved, thus earning the name Kinslayer. <strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">See also</em></strong> Dragon Reborn; Dragon, Prophecies of the.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Dragon Reborn:</strong> According to prophecy and legend the Dragon will be born again at mankind’s greatest hour of need to save the world. This is not something people look forward to, both because the Prophecies say the Dragon Reborn will bring a new Breaking to the world and because Lews Therin Kinslayer, the Dragon, is a name to make men shudder, even more than three thousand years after his death. <strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">See also</em></strong> Dragon, the; Dragon, false; Dragon, Prophecies of the.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Dreadlords:</strong> Men and women able to channel the One Power, who went over to the Shadow during the Trolloc Wars, acting as commanders of the Trolloc forces. Occasionally confused with the Forsaken by the less well educated.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para2"><a id="page_594" class="calibre3"/><strong class="calibre2">Elaida</strong> (eh-LY-da): An Aes Sedai of the Red Ajah. Former advisor to Queen Morgase of Andor. She sometimes has the Foretelling.</p>

<p class="para10"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">Far Dareis Mai</em></strong> (FAHR DAH-rize MY): Literally “Maidens of the Spear.” A warrior society of the Aiel, which, unlike any of the others, admits women and only women. A Maiden may not marry and remain in the society, nor may she fight while carrying a child. Any child born to a Maiden is given to another woman to raise, in such a way that no one knows who the child’s mother was. (“You may belong to no man, nor may any man belong to you, nor any child. The spear is your lover, your child, and your life.”) These children are treasured, for it is prophesied that a child born of a Maiden will unite the clans and return the Aiel to the greatness they knew during the Age of Legends. <strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">See also</em></strong> Aiel; Aiel warrior societies.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Fetches:</strong> <em class="calibre18">See</em> Myrddraal.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Five Powers, the:</strong> There are threads to the One Power, and anyone who can channel can usually grasp some threads better than others. These threads are named according to the sorts of things that can be done using them—Earth, Air (sometimes called Wind), Fire, Water, and Spirit—and are called the Five Powers. Any wielder of the Power will have a greater degree of strength with one, or possibly two, of these, and lesser strength in the others. Some few may have great strength with three, but since the Age of Legends no one has had great strength with all five. Even then this was extremely rare. The degree of strength can vary greatly between individuals. Performing certain acts with the One Power requires the ability to weave flows in one or more of the Five Powers. For example, starting or controlling a fire requires Fire, and affecting the weather requires Air and Water, while Healing requires Air, Water and Spirit. While Spirit was found equally in men and in women, great ability with Earth and/or Fire was found much more often among men; with Water and/or Air among women. There were exceptions, but it was so often so that Earth and Fire came to be regarded as male Powers, Air and Water as female. Generally, no ability is considered stronger than any other, though there is a saying among Aes Sedai: “There is no rock so strong that water and wind cannot wear it away, no fire so fierce that water cannot quench it or wind snuff it out.” It should be noted that any equivalent saying among male Aes Sedai is long lost.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><a id="page_595" class="calibre3"/><strong class="calibre2">Flame of Tar Valon:</strong> Symbol of Tar Valon, the Amyrlin Seat, and the Aes Sedai. A stylized representation of a flame; a white teardrop with the point upward.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Forsaken, the:</strong> Name given to thirteen of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends, which made them among the most powerful ever known, who went over to the Dark One during the War of the Shadow in return for the promise of immortality. According to both legend and fragmentary records, they were imprisoned along with the Dark One when his prison was resealed. Their names—among them Lanfear, Be’lal, Sammael, Asmodean, Rahvin, and Ishamael—are still used to frighten children.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Fortress of the Light:</strong> The great fortress of the Children of the Light, located in Amador (AH-mah-door), the capital of Amadicia (AH-mah-DEE-cee-ah). There is a King of Amadicia, but the Children rule in all but name. <strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">See also</em></strong> Children of the Light.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">gentling:</strong> The act, performed by Aes Sedai, of shutting off a male who can channel from the One Power. This is necessary because any man who learns to channel will go insane from the taint on <em class="calibre18">saidin</em> and will almost certainly do horrible things with the Power in his madness. A man who has been gentled can still sense the True Source, but he cannot touch it. Whatever madness has come before gentling is arrested by the act of gentling, but not cured by it, and if it is done soon enough death can be averted. <strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">See also</em></strong> One Power, the; stilling.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">gleeman:</strong> A traveling storyteller, musician, juggler, tumbler, and all-around entertainer. Known by their trademark cloaks of many-colored patches, gleemen perform mainly in the villages and smaller towns.</p>

Gray Men are so ordinary in appearance that the eye can slide right past without noticing <a id="page_596" class="calibre3"/>them. The vast majority of Gray Men are indeed men, but a small number are women.</p>

(2) To make no weapon with which one man may kill another. (3) Never to use the One Power as a weapon except against Shadowspawn, or in the last extreme of defense of her own life, or that of her Warder or another Aes Sedai. These oaths were not always required, but various events before and since the Breaking caused them to be necessary. The second oath was the first adopted, in reaction to the War of the Power.

Their separation from these <em class="calibre18">stedding</em> after the Breaking of the World (a time called the Exile by Ogier) resulted in what is called the Longing; an Ogier who is too long out of the <em class="calibre18">stedding</em>, sickens and dies. Widely known as wondrous stonemasons who built the great human cities after the Breaking, they consider stonework simply something learned during the Exile and not as important as tending the trees of the <em class="calibre18">stedding</em>, especially the towering Great Trees. Except for stonework, they rarely leave their <em class="calibre18">stedding</em> and typically have little contact with humankind. Knowledge of them among humans is sparse, and many believe Ogier to be only legends. Although believed to be a pacific people and extremely slow to anger, some old stories say they fought alongside humans in the Trolloc Wars, and call them implacable enemies. By and large, they are extremely fond of knowledge, and their books and stories often contain information lost to humans. A typical Ogier lifespan is at least three to four times that of a human.

The vast majority of people are completely unable to learn to channel the One Power. A very small number can be taught to channel, and an even tinier number have the ability inborn. For these few there is no need to be taught; they will touch the True Source and channel the Power whether they want to or not, perhaps without even realizing what they are doing. This inborn ability usually manifests itself in late adolescence or early adulthood. If control is not taught, or self-learned (extremely difficult, with a success rate of only one in four), death is certain. Since the Time of Madness, no man has been able to channel the Power without eventually going completely, horribly mad, and then, even if he has learned some control, dying from a wasting sickness that causes the sufferer to rot alive, a sickness caused, as is the madness, by the Dark One’s taint on <em class="calibre18">saidin</em>. For a woman the death that comes without control of the Power is less horrible, but it is death just the same. Aes Sedai search for girls with the inborn ability as much to save their lives as to increase Aes Sedai numbers, and for men with it in order to stop the terrible things they inevitably do with the Power in their madness. <strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">See also</em></strong> Aes Sedai; channel; Five Powers; Time of Madness; True Source.</p>

Objects made in this manner are called “sung wood” and are highly prized. Few Ogier remain who are Treesingers; the ability seems to be dying out.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Trollocs</strong> (TRAHL-lohks): Creatures of the Dark One, created during the War of the Shadow. Huge of stature, they are a twisted blend of animal and human stock. They are divided into tribelike bands, among them the Dha’vol, the Ko’bal, and the Dhai’mon. Vicious by nature, they kill for the pure pleasure of killing. Deceitful in the extreme, they cannot be trusted unless coerced by fear.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Trolloc Wars:</strong> A series of wars, beginning about 1000 AB and lasting more than three hundred years, during which Trolloc armies ravaged the world. Eventually the Trollocs were driven back into the Great Blight, but some nations ceased to exist, and others that survived were almost depopulated. All records of the time are fragmentary.</p>

It is divided into a male half (<em class="calibre18">saidin</em>) and a female half (<em class="calibre18">saidar</em>), which work at the same time with and against each other.

<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Warder:</strong> A warrior bonded to an Aes Sedai. The bonding is a thing of the One Power, and by it he gains such gifts as quick healing, the ability to go long periods without food, water, or rest, and the ability to sense the taint of the Dark One at a distance. So long as a Warder lives, the Aes Sedai to whom he is bonded knows he is alive however far away he is, and when he dies she will know the moment and manner of his death. While most Ajahs believe an Aes Sedai may have one Warder bonded to her at a time, the Red Ajah refuse to bond any Warders at all, while the Green Ajah believe an Aes Sedai may bond as many Warders as she wishes. Ethically the Warder must accede to the bonding voluntarily, but it has been known to be done against the Warder’s will. What the Aes Sedai gain from the bonding is a closely held secret. <strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">See also</em></strong> Aes Sedai.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">War of the Hundred Years:</strong> A series of overlapping wars among constantly shifting alliances, precipitated by the death of Artur Hawkwing and the resulting struggle for his empire. It lasted from FY 994 to FY 1117. The War of the Hundred Years depopulated large parts of the lands between the Aryth Ocean and the Aiel Waste, from the Sea of Storms to the Great Blight. So great was the destruction that only fragmentary records of the time remain. The empire of Artur Hawkwing was pulled apart in the wars, and the nations of the present day were formed. <strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">See also</em></strong> Hawkwing, Artur.</p>

It began shortly after the attempt to free the Dark One, and soon involved the whole world. In a world where war had been forgotten, even the memory of it, every facet of war was rediscovered, often twisted by the Dark One’s touch on the world, and the One Power was used as a weapon. The war was ended by the resealing of the Dark One into his prison. <strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre18">See also</em></strong> Hundred Companions, the; Dragon, the.</p>

Such women usually build barriers against knowing what it is they are doing, but if these can be broken down, wilders are among the most powerful of channelers.

<p class="hangindent-para2"><strong class="calibre2">Wild Hunt:</strong> It is believed by many that the Dark One (often called Grim, or Old Grim, in Tear, Illian, Murandy, Altara, and Ghealdan) rides out in the night with the “black dogs,” or the Darkhounds, hunting souls. This is the Wild Hunt. Rain can keep the Darkhounds out of the night, but once they are on the trail, they must be confronted and defeated or the victim’s death is inevitable. It is believed that merely seeing the Wild Hunt pass means imminent death, either for the viewer or for someone dear to the viewer.</p>
