<p class="chapterOpenerText">Faile sat impatiently atop Daylight, trying to keep herself from twitching as the gateway split the air. A browning meadow lay on the other side; Gaul and the Maidens immediately slipped through to scout.</p>
<p class="para">“Are you certain you don’t want to come?” Perrin asked Galad, who stood nearby, watching the procession with arms clasped behind his back.</p>
<p class="para">“No,” Galad said. “My meal with Elayne was sufficient for us to catch up.”</p>
<p class="para">“Suit yourself,” Perrin said. He turned to Faile and gestured to the gateway.</p>
<p class="para">She kicked Daylight into motion. It was time, at long last, to face the Queen of Andor, and she had to work to contain her nervousness. Perrin passed through the gateway with her; on the other side, Caemlyn was close, the grand city topped by peaked towers and banners of red and white, palace rising in the center. Low Caemlyn, which sprawled outside the city walls, was a growing city of its own.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin’s procession followed them out of the gateway; it had been carefully planned to look impressive, but not hostile. Alliandre with a hundred guardsmen. A hundred Two Rivers archers with unstrung longbows carried like staves. A hundred representatives of the Wolf Guard, including a large contingent of minor Cairhien nobility, the colored slashes on their uniforms created from cloth purchased in Whitebridge. And, of course, Gaul and the Maidens.</p>
<p class="para">Grady came last. The man wore a neatly pressed black coat, his Dedicated pin polished and gleaming on the high collar. He immediately looked westward, toward the Black Tower. He’d tried to make a gateway there earlier in the day, when Perrin had given him permission. It hadn’t worked. Perrin was disturbed by that. He intended to investigate soon, tonight or tomorrow night at the latest.</p>
<p class="para">Gaul and the Maidens formed up around Perrin and Faile, and the procession moved down onto the road, Arganda and a squad of Perrin’s Wolf Guards riding ahead to announce them. The rest of them moved along the road at a regal pace. Caemlyn’s sprawling growth was even worse than that of Whitebridge. Several armies camped near Low Caemlyn. Probably supported by the various lords who had supported Elayne’s ascent to the throne.</p>
<p class="para">There was a distinct irregularity here. The clouds broke around Caemlyn. The cloud cover had been so universal elsewhere that Faile started upon seeing this. The clouds formed an open circle above the city, eerily even.</p>
<p class="para">Arganda and the Wolf Guards returned. “They will receive us, my Lord, my Lady,” he announced.</p>
<p class="para">Faile and Perrin rode in silence as the group made its way down the road. They had discussed the coming meeting dozens of times over; there wasn’t anything more to say. Perrin had wisely given her the lead in the diplomatic negotiations. The world could not afford war between Andor and the Two Rivers. Not now.</p>
<p class="para">As they passed through the city gates, Perrin and the Aiel grew more alert. She suffered their overprotectiveness in silence. How long would her capture by the Shaido loom over her life? At times, it seemed Perrin was loath to let her use the privy without four dozen guards.</p>
<p class="para">Inside the walls, the streets teemed with people, the buildings and markets packed. Refuse was beginning to pile up, and a frightening number of urchins moved through the crowds. Criers yelled about the dangerous times, some perhaps in the employ of the merchants, encouraging people to hoard. Perrin’s people had bought food here, but it was expensive; soon, Elayne would need to subsidize it, if she hadn’t already. How good were the royal stores?</p>
<p class="para">They passed through the New City, then entered the Inner City, climbing the hill to the Palace itself. The Queen’s Guard stood at attention in their red-and-white tabards and burnished plate-and-mail outside the Palace gates in the pristine white Palace walls.</p>
<p class="para">Once past the gates, they dismounted. A force of one hundred continued on with Perrin and Faile into the Palace. All of the Aiel, and a smaller honor guard from each contingent. The Palace hallways were wide, but that many people still made Faile feel crowded. The path she and Perrin were led along was a different way to the throne room than she’d taken before. Why not use the direct way?</p>
<p class="para">It seemed that little had changed about the Palace since Rand’s time ruling it. There were no Aiel now—save for the ones Perrin had brought. The same narrow red rug ran down the middle of the hallway, the same urns at the corners, the same mirrors on the walls to give an illusion of greater size.</p>
<p class="para">A structure like this could stand unaltered over the centuries, paying little attention to whose feet trod the rugs and whose backside warmed the throne. In one year’s time, this palace had known Morgase, one of the Forsaken, the Dragon Reborn and finally Elayne.</p>
<p class="para">In fact, Faile half-expected—as they rounded the corner to the throne room—to find Rand lounging on his Dragon Throne, that strange half-spear held in the crook of his arm, a glimmer of madness in his eyes. However, the Dragon Throne had been removed, and the Lion Throne again held its queen. Rand had set that throne aside and protected it, like a flower he intended to present to a future love.</p>
<p class="para">The Queen was a younger version of her mother. True, Elayne’s face had angles that were more delicate than Morgase’s. But she had that same red-gold hair and that same stunning beauty. She was tall, and was showing her pregnancy at the belly and through the chest.</p>
<p class="para">The throne room was suitably ornate, with gilded wood trim and narrow pillars in the corners, probably ornamental. Elayne kept the room better lit than Rand had, stand-lamps burning brightly. Morgase herself stood at the base of the throne on the right side, and eight members of the Queen’s Guard stood on the left. Some lesser nobles lined the sides of the room, watching with keen attention.</p>
<p class="para">Elayne leaned forward on her throne as Perrin, Faile and the others entered. Faile curtsied, of course, and Perrin bowed. Not a low bow, but a bow nonetheless. By arrangement, Alliandre curtsied deeper than Faile had. That would immediately set Elayne thinking.</p>
<p class="para">The official purpose of this visit was a commendation by the Crown, a thanks to Perrin and Faile for bringing back Morgase. That was just an affectation, of course. Their real reason for meeting was to discuss the future of the Two Rivers. But that was the sort of delicate goal that neither could speak of outright, at least not at first. Merely stating the objective would reveal too much to the other side.</p>
<p class="para">“Let it be known,” Elayne said with a musical voice, “that the throne welcomes you, Lady Zarine ni Bashere t’Aybara. Queen Alliandre Maritha Kigarin. Perrin Aybara.” No use of title for him. “Let it be proclaimed in person our gratitude to you for returning our mother. Your diligence in this matter earns you the Crown’s deepest appreciation.”</p>
<p class="para">“Thank you, Your Majesty,” Perrin said with his usual gruffness. Faile had spoken to him at length about not trying to dispense with the formality or ceremony.</p>
<p class="para">“We will declare a day of celebration for my mother’s safe return,” Elayne continued. “And for her…restoration to proper status.”</p>
<p class="para">Well, that pause meant Elayne was displeased to know that her mother had been treated as a servant. She had to realize that Perrin and Faile hadn’t known what they were doing, but a queen could still claim indignation for such an event. It was an edge that, perhaps, she planned to use.</p>
<p class="para">Perhaps Faile was reading too much into the comments, but she couldn’t help it. In many ways, being a lady was much like being a merchant, and she had been trained well for both roles.</p>
<p class="para">“Finally,” Elayne said, “we come to the purpose of our meeting. Lady Bashere, Master Aybara. Is there a boon you would ask in return for the gift you have given to Andor?”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin rested his hand on his hammer, then looked to Faile questioningly. Obviously, Elayne expected them to ask for him to be named formally a lord. Or, perhaps, to ask forbearance for impersonating one, along with a formal pardon. Either direction could be a result of this conversation.</p>
<p class="para">Faile was tempted to demand the first. It would be a simple answer. But perhaps too simple; there were things Faile had to know before they could proceed. “Your Majesty,” Faile said, carefully, “might we discuss this boon in a more intimate setting?”</p>
<p class="para">Elayne gave that some thought—at least thirty seconds’ worth, which seemed an infinity. “Very well. My sitting room is prepared.”</p>
<p class="para">Faile nodded, and a servant opened a small door on the left-hand wall of the throne room. Perrin walked toward it, then held up a hand to Gaul, Sulin and Arganda. “Wait here.” He hesitated, glancing at Grady. “You, too.”</p>
<p class="para">None of them seemed to like that, but they obeyed. They’d been warned this might happen.</p>
<p class="para">Faile contained her nervousness—she didn’t like leaving the Asha’man, their best means of escape. Particularly since Elayne undoubtedly had spies and Guards hidden inside the sitting room, ready to spring out should matters turn dangerous. Faile would have liked a similar protection, but bringing a male channeler in to speak with the Queen…well, this was how it would have to be. They were in Elayne’s domain.</p>
<p class="para">Faile took a deep breath, joining Perrin, Alliandre and Morgase in the small side room. Chairs had been arranged; Elayne had foreseen this possibility. They waited for Elayne to enter before sitting. Faile couldn’t see any place for Guards to be hiding.</p>
<p class="para">Elayne entered and waved a hand. The Great Serpent ring on her finger glittered in the lamplight. Faile had nearly forgotten that she was Aes Sedai. Perhaps there weren’t any Guardsmen lurking around to help—a woman who could channel was as dangerous as a dozen soldiers.</p>
<p class="para">Which of the rumors regarding the father of Elayne’s child were to be believed? Surely not the ones about that fool of a man in her Guard—that was most likely obfuscation. Could it possibly be Rand himself?</p>
<p class="para">Morgase entered after Elayne. She wore a subdued gown of deep red. She sat down beside her daughter, watching carefully, remaining silent.</p>
<p class="para">“So,” Elayne said, “explain to me why I shouldn’t just execute you both as traitors.”</p>
<p class="para">Faile blinked in surprise. Perrin, however, snorted. “I don’t think Rand would think very highly of that move.”</p>
<p class="para">“I’m not beholden to him,” Elayne said. “You expect me to believe that <span class="italic1">he</span> was behind you seducing my citizens and naming yourself a king?”</p>
<p class="para">“You have a few of your facts backward, Your Majesty,” Faile said testily. “Perrin never named himself king.”</p>
<p class="para">“Oh, and did he raise the flag of Manetheren, as my informants tell me he did?” Elayne asked.</p>
<p class="para">“I did that,” Perrin said. “But I put it away of my own choice.”</p>
<p class="para">“Well, that’s something,” Elayne replied. “You may not have called yourself a king, but holding up that banner was essentially the same thing. Oh, sit down, all of you.” She waved a hand. A tray lifted off the far table and floated over to her. It bore goblets and a pitcher of wine, as well as a teapot and cups.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Fetching it with the One Power,</span> Faile thought. <span class="italic1">It’s a reminder of her strength.</span> A rather unsubtle one.</p>
<p class="para">“Still,” Elayne said, “I will do the best for my realm, regardless of the cost.”</p>
<p class="para">“I doubt that upsetting the Two Rivers,” Alliandre said hesitantly, “would be best for your realm. Executing their leader would undoubtedly throw the region into rebellion.”</p>
<p class="para">“So far as I’m concerned,” Elayne said, pouring several cups of tea, “they’re already in rebellion.”</p>
<p class="para">“We came to you peacefully,” Faile said. “Hardly the action of rebels.”</p>
<p class="para">Elayne took a sip of the tea first, as was the custom, to prove it wasn’t poisoned. “My envoys to the Two Rivers have been refused, and your people there gave me a message—and I quote—‘The lands of Lord Perrin Goldeneyes refuse your Andoran taxes. <span class="italic1">Tai’shar Manetheren!</span>’ ”</p>
<p class="para">Alliandre paled. Perrin groaned softly, a sound that came out faintly like a growl. Faile took her cup and sipped her tea—mint, with cloudberries; it was good. The Two Rivers folk had pluck, that was certain.</p>
<p class="para">“These are passionate times, Your Majesty,” Faile said. “Surely you can see that the people might be concerned; the Two Rivers has not often been a priority for your throne.”</p>
<p class="para">“That’s putting it mildly,” Perrin added with a snort. “Most of us grew up not knowing we were part of Andor. You ignored us.”</p>
<p class="para">“That was because the area wasn’t rising in rebellion.” Elayne sipped her tea.</p>
<p class="para">“Rebellion isn’t the only reason men might need the attention of the queen who claims them,” Perrin said. “I don’t know if you’ve heard, but last year we faced Trollocs on our own, and without a whisker of help from the Crown. You’d have helped if you’d known, but the fact that there were no troops nearby—none <span class="italic1">capable</span> of knowing our danger—says something.”</p>
<p class="para">Elayne hesitated.</p>
<p class="para">“The Two Rivers has rediscovered its history,” Faile said carefully. “It couldn’t rest forever, not with Tarmon Gai’don looming. Not after sheltering the Dragon Reborn during his childhood. Part of me wonders if Manetheren had to fall, if the Two Rivers had to rise, to provide a place for Rand al’Thor to be raised. Among farmers with the blood—and obstinacy—of kings.”</p>
<p class="para">“Which makes it all the more important that I quiet things <span class="italic1">now</span>,” Elayne said. “I offered you a boon so that you could ask for forgiveness. I’d pardon you, and I’ll be certain to send troops so that your people are protected. Accept this, and we can all go back to life the way it should be.”</p>
<p class="para">“That isn’t going to happen,” Perrin said softly. “The Two Rivers will have lords, now. I fought it for a time. You may, too, but it won’t change anything.”</p>
<p class="para">“Perhaps,” Elayne said. “But recognizing <span class="italic1">you</span> would be to agree that a man can just claim a title within my nation, then keep it by stubbornly gathering an army. It makes for a terrible precedent, Perrin. I don’t think you realize the predicament you’ve put me in.”</p>
<p class="para">“We’ll muddle through,” Perrin said in that stubborn tone he used when he wasn’t going to budge. “I’m not stepping down.”</p>
<p class="para">“You’re doing a poor job of persuading me you will accept my authority,” Elayne snapped.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Not good,</span> Faile thought, opening her mouth to jump in. A clash here would <span class="italic1">not</span> serve them well.</p>
<p class="para">Before she could speak, however, another voice cut in. “Daughter,” Morgase said softly, drinking her tea. “If you plan to dance with <span class="italic1">ta’veren</span>, be sure that you know the proper steps. I’ve traveled with this man. I’ve seen the world bend around him; I’ve seen bitter enemies become his allies. To fight the Pattern itself is to try to move a mountain with a spoon.”</p>
<p class="para">Elayne hesitated, looking at her mother.</p>
<p class="para">“Please forgive me if I overstep myself,” Morgase continued. “But Elayne, I promised these two that I would speak for them. I told you I would. Andor is strong, but I fear it could break itself against this man. He does not want your throne, I promise it, and the Two Rivers <span class="italic1">does</span> need supervision. Would it be such a terrible thing to let them have the man they themselves have chosen?”</p>
<p class="para">The small room fell silent. Elayne eyed Perrin, sizing him up. Faile held her breath.</p>
<p class="para">“All right,” Elayne said. “I assume you’ve come with demands. Let’s hear them so we can discover if there’s anything that can be done.”</p>
<p class="para">“No demands,” Faile said. “An offer.”</p>
<p class="para">Elayne raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="para">“Your mother is right,” Faile said. “Perrin does not want your throne.”</p>
<p class="para">“What you two want may be irrelevant once your people get an idea in their minds.”</p>
<p class="para">Faile shook her head. “They love him, Your Majesty. They respect him. They’ll do what he says. We <span class="italic1">can</span> and <span class="italic1">will</span> put down ideas of Manetheren rising again.”</p>
<p class="para">“And why would you do that?” Elayne asked. “I know how fast the Two Rivers is growing with those refugees coming in over the mountains. Nations could rise and fall with the coming of the Last Battle. You have no reason to give up the chance to form your own kingdom.”</p>
<p class="para">“Actually,” Faile said, “we have good reason. Andor is a strong nation, and prosperous. The towns in the Two Rivers may be growing rapidly, but the people have barely begun to want a lord. They’re still farmers at heart. They don’t want glory; they want their crops to survive.” Faile paused. “Perhaps you’re right, perhaps there will be another Breaking, but that’s only more reason to have allies. Nobody wants civil war in Andor, least of all the Two Rivers folk.”</p>
<p class="para">“What do you propose, then?” Elayne said.</p>
<p class="para">“Nothing, really, that doesn’t exist already,” Faile said. “Give Perrin an official title and make him High Lord over the Two Rivers.”</p>
<p class="para">“And what do you mean by ‘High Lord’?” Elayne asked.</p>
<p class="para">“He’d rank higher than other noble Houses in Andor, but beneath the Queen.”</p>
<p class="para">“I doubt the others would like that,” Elayne said. “What of taxes?”</p>
<p class="para">“The Two Rivers is exempt,” Faile said. As Elayne’s expression soured, she continued quickly. “Your Majesty, the throne ignored the Two Rivers for generations, not protecting them from bandits or sending workers to improve their roads, not giving them anything in the way of magistrates or justices.”</p>
<p class="para">“They didn’t need it,” Elayne said. “They governed themselves fine.” She left unsaid that the Two Rivers folk would probably have tossed out tax collectors, magistrates or justices sent by the Queen—but she seemed to know it.</p>
<p class="para">“Well,” Faile said, “nothing needs change, then. The Two Rivers governs itself.”</p>
<p class="para">“You could have tariff-free trade with them,” Alliandre said.</p>
<p class="para">“Something I already have,” Elayne said.</p>
<p class="para">“So nothing changes,” Faile said again. “Except that you gain a powerful province to the west. Perrin, as your ally and subject lord, will agree to marshal troops in your defense. He will also call up his sworn monarchs to your allegiance.”</p>
<p class="para">Elayne glanced at Alliandre. She’d probably heard of Alliandre’s swearing from Morgase, but also would want to hear it for herself.</p>
<p class="para">“I swore fealty to Lord Perrin,” Alliandre said. “Ghealdan had long lacked strong allies. I meant to change that.”</p>
<p class="para">“Your Majesty,” Faile said, leaning forward, tea cupped in her hands before her. “Perrin spent several weeks with some Seanchan officers. They have created a great pact of nations allied beneath one banner. Rand al’Thor, though you may trust him as a friend, has done the same. Tear, Illian, and maybe now Arad Doman are beneath his rule. Nations <span class="italic1">join</span> rather than split, these days. Andor looks smaller by the hour.”</p>
<p class="para">“That’s why I did what I did,” Alliandre said.</p>
<p class="para">Well, in Faile’s view, Alliandre had been caught up by Perrin as a <span class="italic1">ta’veren</span>. There hadn’t been much planning. But Alliandre might see it otherwise.</p>
<p class="para">“Your Majesty,” Faile continued, “there is much to gain here. Through my marriage to Perrin, you gain a tie to Saldaea. Through Alliandre’s oaths, you gain Ghealdan. Berelain also follows Perrin and has often mentioned her desire to find strong allies for Mayene. If we were to speak with her, I suspect she might be willing to make an alliance with us. We could create our own pact. Five nations, if you count the Two Rivers as one—six, if you do take the Sun Throne, as rumor claims you will. We are not the most powerful nations, but the many are stronger than the one. And you would be at our head.”</p>
<p class="para">Elayne’s face had lost almost all of its hostility. “Saldaea. What are you in its line of succession?”</p>
<p class="para">“I’m second,” Faile admitted, which Elayne probably already knew. Perrin shifted in his chair. She knew he was still uncomfortable with that fact; well, he would simply have to get used to it.</p>
<p class="para">“Second is too close,” Elayne replied. “What if you end up with the throne of Saldaea? I could lose the Two Rivers to another country that way.”</p>
<p class="para">“This is easy to fix,” Alliandre said. “If Faile were to ascend, one of her and Perrin’s children could continue as Lord of the Two Rivers. Another could take the throne of Saldaea. Put it in writing, and you will be protected.”</p>
<p class="para">“I could accept such an arrangement,” Elayne said.</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t have problems with it,” Faile replied, looking at Perrin.</p>
<p class="para">“I suppose.”</p>
<p class="para">“I should like one of them myself,” Elayne said thoughtfully. “One of your children, I mean, to marry into the Andoran royal line. If the Two Rivers is to be ruled by a lord with as much power as this treaty would give him, then I would love to have blood connections to the throne.”</p>
<p class="para">“I won’t promise that,” Perrin said. “My children will make their own choices.”</p>
<p class="para">“It is sometimes the way of nobility,” Elayne said. “It would be unusual, but not unheard of, for children like ours to be engaged from birth.”</p>
<p class="para">“We won’t do it that way in the Two Rivers,” Perrin said stubbornly. “Ever.”</p>
<p class="para">Faile shrugged. “We could offer encouragement, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p class="para">Elayne hesitated, then nodded. “That will be fine. But the other Houses won’t like this ‘High Lord’ business. There’d need to be a way around it…”</p>
<p class="para">“Give the Two Rivers to the Dragon Reborn,” Morgase said.</p>
<p class="para">Elayne’s eyes lit up. “Yes. That would work. If I gave the area to him to be his seat in Andor…”</p>
<p class="para">Faile opened her mouth, but Elayne cut her off with a wave of the hand. “This isn’t negotiable. I’ll need <span class="italic1">some</span> way to convince the other lords and ladies that I’m right to give the Two Rivers so much autonomy. If the lands are granted to the Dragon Reborn, giving him a title in Andor and making the Two Rivers his seat, then it will make sense for your home to be treated differently.</p>
<p class="para">“The noble Houses of Andor will accept this, since the Two Rivers is where Rand came from, and Andor <span class="italic1">does</span> owe him a debt. We’ll have him appoint Perrin’s line as his stewards. Instead of capitulating to rebels within my borders, I’ll be seen allowing the Dragon Reborn, the man I love, to elevate his good friend. It might also give us some ground against the Illian-Tear pact you mentioned, who are bound to claim that their ties to Rand give them the right of conquest.” She grew thoughtful, tapping the side of her cup.</p>
<p class="para">“That seems reasonable,” Perrin said, nodding. “Steward of the Two Rivers. I like the sound of that.”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, well,” Faile said. “I guess it’s settled, then.”</p>
<p class="para">“The taxes,” Elayne said, as if she hadn’t heard. “You put them into a trust to be administered by Perrin and his line, with the understanding that if the Dragon ever returns, he can call upon them. Yes. That gives us a legal excuse for your exemption. Of course, Perrin will have authority to dip into those funds to improve the Two Rivers. Roads, food stores, defenses.”</p>
<p class="para">Elayne looked at Faile, then smiled, taking a long drink of tea. “I’m beginning to think it was a good idea not to execute you.”</p>
<p class="para">“That’s certainly a relief,” Alliandre said, smiling. As the least powerful one in the union, she stood to gain a lot from the alliances.</p>
<p class="para">“Your Majesty—” Faile said.</p>
<p class="para">“Call me Elayne,” she said, pouring a goblet of wine for Faile.</p>
<p class="para">“Very well, Elayne,” Faile said, smiling and putting aside her tea, then accepting the wine. “I need to ask. Do you know what is happening with the Dragon Reborn?”</p>
<p class="para">“Ox-brained lummox,” Elayne said, shaking her head. “The bloody man’s got Egwene all riled up.”</p>
<p class="para">“Egwene?” Perrin asked.</p>
<p class="para">“She’s Amyrlin, finally,” Elayne said, as if the fact had been inevitable. Perrin nodded, though Faile found herself amazed. How had <span class="italic1">that</span> happened, and why wasn’t Perrin surprised by it?</p>
<p class="para">“What’s he gone and done?” Perrin asked.</p>
<p class="para">“He says he’s going to break the remaining seals of the Dark One’s prison,” Elayne said, frowning. “We’ll need to stop him, of course. Foolish plan. You could help with that. Egwene’s gathering a force to persuade him.”</p>
<p class="para">“I think I could be of help,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para">“Do you know where he is currently?” Faile asked. Perrin had a good idea, from his visions, but she wanted to know what Elayne knew.</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t know,” Elayne said. “But I do know where he <span class="italic1">will</span> be…”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Fortuona Athaem Devi Paendrag, ruler of the Glorious Seanchan Empire, marched into her Teaching Chamber. She wore a magnificent gown of golden cloth, cut after the highest Imperial fashion. The skirt split at the front to just above the knees, and was so long that it took five <span class="italic1">da’covale</span> to carry the sides and train.</p>
<p class="para">She wore an ornate headdress, of gold and crimson silk with beautiful silken wings shaped like those of an owl taking flight, and her arms glittered with thirteen bracelets, each of a different gemstone combination. She wore crystal at her throat in a long strand. She had heard an owl above her window the last night, and it had not flown away when she looked out. An omen indicating great care should be taken, that the next days would be ones of important decisions. The proper response was to wear jewelry with powerful symbolism.</p>
<p class="para">When she entered the chamber, those inside prostrated themselves. Only the Deathwatch Guard—men in armor of blood red and deep green—was exempt; they bowed, but kept their eyes up, watching for danger.</p>
<p class="para">The large chamber was windowless. Lines of stacked pottery stood at one end, a place for <span class="italic1">damane</span> to practice weaves of destruction. The floor was covered in woven mats where stubborn <span class="italic1">damane</span> were sent to the ground, writhing in pain. It would not do for them to be harmed physically. <span class="italic1">Damane</span> were among the most important tools the Empire had, more valuable than horses or <span class="italic1">raken</span>. You did not destroy a beast because it was slow to learn; you punished it until it learned.</p>
<p class="para">Fortuona crossed the chamber to where a proper Imperial Throne had been set up. She commonly came here, to watch the <span class="italic1">damane</span> being worked or broken. It soothed her. The throne was atop a small dais; she climbed the steps, train rustling as her <span class="italic1">da’covale</span> carried it. She turned to face the room, allowing the servants to arrange her dress. They took her by her arms and lifted her back into the throne, draping her long golden skirts down the front of the dais like a tapestry.</p>
<p class="para">Those skirts were sewn with the writings of Imperial power. <span class="italic1">The Empress IS Seanchan. The Empress WILL live forever. The Empress MUST be obeyed.</span> She sat as a living banner to the might of the Empire.</p>
<p class="para">Selucia took her position on the lower steps of the dais. This done, the courtiers raised themselves. The <span class="italic1">damane</span>, of course, remained kneeling. There were ten of them, with heads bowed, their <span class="italic1">sul’dam</span> holding their leashes and—in a few cases—patting them affectionately on the heads.</p>
<p class="para">King Beslan entered. He’d shaved most of his head, leaving only a dark strip on the top, and seven of his fingernails had been lacquered. One more fingernail than anyone on this side of the ocean, excepting Fortuona herself. He still wore Altaran clothing—a uniform of green and white—rather than Seanchan robes. She had not pressed him on this.</p>
<p class="para">So far as she knew, since his raising, Beslan hadn’t made any plans to have her assassinated. Remarkable. Any Seanchan would have immediately begun scheming. Some would have tried an assassination; others would have decided to make only plans, but remain supportive. But all would have <span class="italic1">considered</span> killing her.</p>
<p class="para">Many on this side of the ocean thought differently. She’d never have believed it, if not for her time with Matrim. That was obviously one reason why Fortuona had been required to go with him. She just wished she’d interpreted the omens earlier.</p>
<p class="para">Beslan was joined by Captain-General Lunal Galgan and a few members of the low Blood. Galgan was a wide-shouldered fellow with a crest of white hair atop his head. The other members of the Blood deferred to him; they knew he had her favor. If things went well here and with the reclamation of Seanchan, there was a good chance she’d raise him to the Imperial family. The ranks of the family would need to be refilled, after all, once Fortuona returned and restored order. Undoubtedly, many had been assassinated or executed. Galgan was a valuable ally. He’d not only worked openly against Suroth, but had suggested the assault on the White Tower, which had gone well. Extremely well.</p>
<p class="para">Melitene, Fortuona’s <span class="italic1">der’sul’dam</span>, stepped forward and bowed again. The stout, graying woman led a <span class="italic1">damane</span> with dark brown hair and bloodshot eyes. Apparently this one wept often.</p>
<p class="para">Melitene had the presence to look embarrassed at the weeping, and bowed extra low. Fortuona chose not to notice that the <span class="italic1">damane</span> was acting so displeasingly. This one was a fine catch, despite her petulance.</p>
<p class="para">Fortuona made a series of gestures to Selucia, instructing her in what to say. The woman watched with keen eyes, half of her head covered in cloth while she waited for the hair to grow there, the other half shaved. Fortuona would eventually have to choose another Voice, as Selucia was now her Truthspeaker.</p>
<p class="para">“Show us what this woman can do,” Selucia said, Voicing the words Fortuona had signed to her.</p>
<p class="para">Melitene patted the <span class="italic1">damane</span> on the head. “Suffa will show the Empress—may she live forever—the Power of slicing the air.”</p>
<p class="para">“Please,” Suffa said, looking pleadingly toward Fortuona. “Please, listen to me. I am the <span class="italic1">Amyrlin Seat</span>.”</p>
<p class="para">Melitene hissed, and Suffa’s eyes opened wide, obviously feeling a blast of pain through the <span class="italic1">a’dam</span>. The <span class="italic1">damane</span> continued anyway. “I can offer great bounty, powerful Empress! If I am returned, I will give you ten women to take my place. Twenty! The most powerful the White Tower has. I—” She broke off, moaning, and collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p class="para">Melitene was sweating. She looked to Selucia, speaking quickly, nervously. “Please explain to the Empress of us all—may she live forever—that my eyes are lowered for not having trained this one properly. Suffa is amazingly stubborn, despite how quick she is to weep and offer others in her place.”</p>
<p class="para">Fortuona sat for a moment, letting Melitene sweat. Eventually, she signed for Selucia to speak.</p>
<p class="para">“The Empress is not displeased with you,” Selucia Voiced. “These <span class="italic1">marath’damane</span> who call themselves Aes Sedai have all proven stubborn.”</p>
<p class="para">“Please express my gratitude to the Greatest One,” Melitene said, relaxing. “If it pleases She Whose Eyes Look Upward, I <span class="italic1">can</span> make Suffa perform. But there may be further outbursts.”</p>
<p class="para">“You may continue,” Selucia Voiced.</p>
<p class="para">Melitene knelt beside Suffa, speaking sharply at first, then consolingly. She was very skilled at working with former <span class="italic1">marath’damane</span>. Of course, Fortuona considered herself good with <span class="italic1">damane</span> as well. She enjoyed breaking <span class="italic1">marath’damane</span> as much as her brother Halvate had enjoyed training wild <span class="italic1">grolm</span>. She’d always found it a pity that he had been assassinated. He was the only one of her brothers who she’d ever been fond of.</p>
<p class="para">Suffa finally got back onto her knees. Fortuona leaned forward, curious. Suffa bowed her head, and a line of light—brilliant and pure—cut the air in front of her. That line turned sideways along a central axis, opening a hole directly in front of Fortuona’s throne. Trees rustled beyond, and Fortuona’s breath caught as she saw a hawk with a white head streak away from the portal. An omen of great power. The normally unflappable Selucia gasped, though whether it was at the portal or the omen, Fortuona did not know.</p>
<p class="para">Fortuona covered her own surprise. So it was true. Traveling wasn’t a myth or a rumor. It was real. This changed everything about the war.</p>
<p class="para">Beslan walked forward, bowing to her, looking hesitant. She waved for him and Galgan to come to where they could see the forest glade through the opening. Beslan stared, mouth hanging open.</p>
<p class="para">Galgan clasped his hands behind his back. He was a curious one. He’d met with assassins in the city, and had inquired about the cost for having Fortuona killed. Then, he’d had each of the men who quoted him a price executed. A very subtle maneuver—it was meant to show that she should consider him a threat, as he was not afraid of meeting with assassins. However, it was also a visible sign of loyalty. <span class="italic1">I follow you for now,</span> the move said, <span class="italic1">but I am watching, and I am ambitious.</span></p>
<p class="para">In many ways, his careful maneuvering was more comforting to her than Beslan’s apparently unwavering loyalty. The first, she could anticipate. The second…well, she wasn’t certain what to make of it yet. Would Matrim be equally loyal? What would it be like, to have a Prince of the Ravens whom she did not have to plot against? It seemed almost a fantasy, the type of tale told to common children to make them dream of an impossible marriage.</p>
<p class="para">“This is incredible!” Beslan said. “Greatest One, with this ability…” His station made him one of the only people able to speak directly to her.</p>
<p class="para">“The Empress wishes to know,” Selucia Voiced, reading Fortuona’s fingers, “if any of the captured <span class="italic1">marath’damane</span> spoke of the weapon.”</p>
<p class="para">“Tell the highest Empress—may she live forever—that they did not,” Melitene said, sounding worried. “And, if I may be so bold, I believe that they are not lying. It seems that the explosion outside the city was an isolated accident—the result of some unknown <span class="italic1">ter’angreal</span>, used imprudently. Perhaps there <span class="italic1">is</span> no weapon.”</p>
<p class="para">It was possible. Fortuona had already begun to doubt the validity of those rumors. The explosion had happened before Fortuona had arrived in Ebou Dar, and the details were confusing. Perhaps this had all been a ploy by Suroth or her enemies.</p>
<p class="para">“Captain-General,” Selucia Voiced. “The Greatest One wishes to know what you would do with a Power such as this Traveling ability.”</p>
<p class="para">“That depends,” Galgan said, rubbing his chin. “What is its range? How large can she make it? Can all <span class="italic1">damane</span> do this? Are there limitations on where a hole can be opened? If it pleases the Greatest One, I will speak with the <span class="italic1">damane</span> and get these answers.”</p>
<p class="para">“It does please the Empress,” Selucia Voiced.</p>
<p class="para">“This is troubling,” Beslan said. “They could attack behind our battle lines. They could open a portal like this into the Empress’s own chambers, may she live forever. With this…everything we know about war will change.”</p>
<p class="para">The members of the Deathwatch Guard shuffled—a sign of great discomfort. Only Furyk Karede did not move. If anything, his expression grew harder. Fortuona knew that he would soon be suggesting a new, rotating location of her sleeping quarters.</p>
<p class="para">Fortuona thought for a moment, staring at that rent in the air. That rent in reality itself. Then, contrary to tradition, she stood up on her dais. Fortunately, Beslan was there, one she could address directly—and let the others hear her commands.</p>
<p class="para">“Reports say,” Fortuona announced, “that there are still hundreds of <span class="italic1">marath’damane</span> in the place called the White Tower. They are the key to recapturing Seanchan, the key to holding this land, and the key to preparing for the Last Battle. The Dragon Reborn <span class="italic1">will</span> serve the Crystal Throne.</p>
<p class="para">“We have been provided with a way to strike. Let it be said to the Captain-General that he should gather his finest soldiers. I want each and every <span class="italic1">damane</span> we control to be brought back to the city. We will train them in this method of Traveling. And then we will go, in force, to the White Tower. Before, we struck them with a pinprick. Now, we will let them know the full weight of our sword. <span class="italic1">All</span> of the <span class="italic1">marath’damane</span> must be leashed.”</p>
<p class="para">She sat back down, letting the room fall still. It was rare that the Empress made such announcements personally. But this was a time for boldness.</p>
<p class="para">“You should not allow word of this to spread,” Selucia said to her, voice firm. She was now speaking in her role as Truthspeaker. Yes, another would have to be chosen to be Fortuona’s Voice. “You would be a fool to let the enemy know for certain we have this Traveling.”</p>
<p class="para">Fortuona took a deep breath. Yes, that was true. She would make certain each in this room was held to secrecy. But once the White Tower was captured, they would talk of her proclamation, and would read the omens of her victory upon the skies and world around them.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">We will need to strike soon,</span> Selucia signed.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Yes,</span> Fortuona signed back. <span class="italic1">Our previous attack will have them gathering arms.</span></p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Our next move will have to be decisive, then,</span> Selucia signed. <span class="italic1">But think. Delivering thousands of soldiers into the White Tower through a hidden basement room. Striking with the force of a thousand hammers against a thousand anvils!</span></p>
<p class="para">Fortuona nodded.</p>
<p class="para">The White Tower was doomed.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">“Don’t know that there’s much more to say, Perrin,” Thom said, leaning back in his chair, tabac smoke curling out of his long-stemmed pipe. It was a warm night, and they didn’t have a fire in the hearth. Just a few candles on the table, with some bread, cheeses and a pitcher of ale.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin puffed on his own pipe. Only he, Thom and Mat were in the room. Gaul and Grady waited out in the common room. Mat had cursed Perrin for bringing those two—an Aiel and an Asha’man were rather conspicuous. But Perrin felt safer with those two than with an entire company of soldiers.</p>
<p class="para">He’d shared his story with Mat and Thom first, speaking of Malden, the Prophet, Alliandre, and Galad. Then they had filled him in on their experiences. It stunned Perrin, how much had happened to the three of them since their parting.</p>
<p class="para">“Empress of the Seanchan, eh?” Perrin said, watching the smoke twist above him in the dim room.</p>
<p class="para">“Daughter of the Nine Moons,” Mat said. “It’s different.”</p>
<p class="para">“And you’re married.” Perrin grinned. “Matrim Cauthon. Married.”</p>
<p class="para">“You didn’t have to share that part, you know,” Mat said to Thom.</p>
<p class="para">“Oh, I assure you, I did indeed.”</p>
<p class="para">“For a gleeman, you seem to leave out most of the heroic parts of the things I do,” Mat said. “At least you mentioned the hat.”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin smiled, contented. He hadn’t realized how much he’d missed sitting with friends to spend the evening chatting. A carved wooden sign hung outside the window, dripping with rainwater. It depicted faces wearing strange hats and exaggerated smiles. The Happy Throng. There was probably a story behind the name.</p>
<p class="para">The three of them were in a private dining chamber, paid for by Mat. They’d brought in three of the inn’s large hearth chairs. They didn’t fit the table, but they were comfortable. Mat leaned back, putting his feet up on the table. He took up a hunk of ewe’s milk cheese and bit off a piece, then balanced the rest on his chair arm.</p>
<p class="para">“You know, Mat,” Perrin said, “your wife is probably going to expect you to be taught table manners.”</p>
<p class="para">“Oh, I’ve been taught,” Mat said. “I just never learned.”</p>
<p class="para">“I’d like to meet her,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para">“She’s something interesting,” Thom replied.</p>
<p class="para">“Interesting,” Mat said. “Yeah.” He looked wistful. “Anyway, you’ve heard the lot of it now, Perrin. That bloody Brown brought us here. Haven’t seen her in over two weeks, now.”</p>
<p class="para">“Can I see the note?” Perrin asked.</p>
<p class="para">Mat patted a few pockets, then fished out a small white piece of paper, folded closed and sealed with red wax. He tossed it onto the table. The corners were bent, the paper smudged, but it hadn’t been opened. Matrim Cauthon was a man of his word, at least when you could pry an oath out of him.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin lifted the note. It smelled faintly of perfume. He turned it over, then held it up to a candle.</p>
<p class="para">“Doesn’t work,” Mat said.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin grunted. “So what do you think it says?”</p>
<p class="para">“Don’t know,” Mat said. “Bloody insane Aes Sedai. I mean, they’re all odd. But Verin’s fallen completely off her stone. Don’t suppose you’ve heard from her?”</p>
<p class="para">“I haven’t.”</p>
<p class="para">“Hope she’s all right,” Mat said. “She sounded worried something might happen to her.” He took the note back, then tapped it on the table.</p>
<p class="para">“You going to open it?”</p>
<p class="para">Mat shook his head. “I’ll open it when I get back. I—”</p>
<p class="para">A knock came at the door, then it creaked open, revealing the innkeeper, a younger man named Denezel. He was tall, with a lean face and a head he kept shaved. The man was all but Dragonsworn, from what Perrin had seen, even going so far as to have a portrait of Rand commissioned and hung in the common room. It wasn’t a bad likeness.</p>
<p class="para">“I apologize, Master Crimson,” Denezel said, “but Master Golden’s man insisted on speaking with him.”</p>
<p class="para">“It’s all right,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para">Grady poked his weathered face into the room and Denezel retreated.</p>
<p class="para">“Ho, Grady,” Mat said, waving. “Blown up anyone interesting lately?”</p>
<p class="para">The tanned Asha’man frowned, looking to Perrin. “My Lord. Lady Faile asked me to remind you when midnight arrived.”</p>
<p class="para">Mat whistled. “See, this is why I left my wife in another kingdom.”</p>
<p class="para">Grady’s frown deepened.</p>
<p class="para">“Thank you, Grady,” Perrin said with a sigh. “I hadn’t realized the time. We’ll be going soon.”</p>
<p class="para">The Asha’man nodded, then withdrew.</p>
<p class="para">“Burn him,” Mat said. “Can’t the man at least smile? Flaming sky is depressing enough without people like him trying to imitate it.”</p>
<p class="para">“Well, son,” Thom said, pouring some ale, “some just don’t find the world particularly humorous lately.”</p>
<p class="para">“Nonsense,” Mat said. “The world’s plenty humorous. The whole bloody place has been laughing at me, lately. I’m telling you, Perrin. With those drawings of us about, you need to keep your head low.”</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t see how I can,” Perrin said. “I’ve got an army to lead, people to care for.”</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t think you’re taking Verin’s warning seriously enough, lad,” Thom said, shaking his head. “You ever heard of the Banath people?”</p>
<p class="para">“No,” Perrin said, looking at Mat.</p>
<p class="para">“They were a group of savages who roamed what is now Almoth Plain,” Thom said. “I know a couple fine songs about them. See, their various tribes always painted the skin of their leader red to make him stand out.”</p>
<p class="para">Mat took another bite of his cheese. “Bloody fools. Painted their leader red? That would make him a target for every soldier on the field!”</p>
<p class="para">“That was the point,” Thom said. “It was a challenge, you see. How else would their enemies be able find him and test their skill against him?”</p>
<p class="para">Mat snorted. “I’d have painted a few decoy soldiers red to distract them from me, then had my archers feather their leader with arrows while everyone was trying to hunt down the fellows they thought were leading my army.”</p>
<p class="para">“Actually,” Thom said, taking a sip of his ale, “that’s exactly what Villiam Bloodletter did during his first, and last, battle with them. ‘The Song of a Hundred Days’ talks about it. Brilliant maneuver. I’m surprised you’ve heard of that song—it’s very obscure, and the battle happened so long ago, most history books don’t even remember it.”</p>
<p class="para">For some reason, the comment made Mat smell nervous.</p>
<p class="para">“You’re saying that we’re making ourselves targets,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para">“I’m saying,” Thom replied, “that you boys are getting harder and harder to hide. Everywhere you go, banners proclaim your arrival. People talk about you. I’m half-convinced you have only survived this long because the Forsaken didn’t know where to find you.”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin nodded, thinking of the trap his army had nearly fallen into. Assassins in the night <span class="italic1">would</span> come. “So what should I do?”</p>
<p class="para">“Mat’s been sleeping in a different tent each night,” Thom said. “And sometimes in the city. You should try something like that. Grady can make gateways, right? Why not have him make one for you into the middle of your tent each night? Sneak out and sleep someplace else, then Travel back in the morning. Everyone will assume you’re in your tent. If assassins strike, you won’t be there.”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin nodded thoughtfully. “Even better, I could leave five or six Aiel inside, on alert, waiting.”</p>
<p class="para">“Perrin,” Mat said, “that’s downright devious.” He smiled. “You’ve changed for the better, my friend.”</p>
<p class="para">“From you, I’ll try to accept that as a compliment,” Perrin said. He paused, then added, “It will be difficult.”</p>
<p class="para">Thom chuckled. “He’s right, though. You’ve changed. What happened to the soft-spoken, unsure boy I helped escape the Two Rivers?”</p>
<p class="para">“He passed through the blacksmith’s fire,” Perrin said softly.</p>
<p class="para">Thom nodded, seeming to understand.</p>
<p class="para">“And you, Mat?” Perrin said. “Can I do something to help you? Maybe let you Travel between tents?”</p>
<p class="para">“No. I’ll be fine.”</p>
<p class="para">“How are you going to protect yourself?”</p>
<p class="para">“With my wits.”</p>
<p class="para">“Planning to find some of those, then?” Perrin said. “About time.”</p>
<p class="para">Mat snorted. “What is it with everyone and my wits lately? I’ll be fine, trust me. Remind me to tell you about the night when I first figured out I could win whatever dice game I wanted to. It’s a good story. Involves falling off bridges. One bridge, at least.”</p>
<p class="para">“Well…you could tell us now,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para">“Not the right time. Anyway, it doesn’t matter. See, I’m leaving soon.”</p>
<p class="para">Thom smelled excited.</p>
<p class="para">“Perrin, you will lend us a gateway, won’t you?” Mat asked. “Hate to leave the Band. They’ll be inconsolable without me. At least they have those dragons to blow things up.”</p>
<p class="para">“But where are you going?” Perrin asked.</p>
<p class="para">“Suppose I should explain it,” Mat said. “That <span class="italic1">was</span> the reason for meeting with you, aside from the amiable discourse and all.” He leaned in. “Perrin, Moiraine is alive.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">“What?”</span></p>
<p class="para">“It’s true,” Mat said. “Or, well, we think it is. She sent Thom a letter, claiming she’d foreseen the battle with Lanfear, and knew that she would…Well, anyway, there’s this tower west of here on the River Arinelle. It’s made all of metal. It—”</p>
<p class="para">“The Tower of Ghenjei,” Perrin said softly. “Yes, I know of it.”</p>
<p class="para">Mat blinked. “You do? Burn me. When did you get to be a scholar?”</p>
<p class="para">“I’ve merely heard some things. Mat, that place is evil.”</p>
<p class="para">“Well, Moiraine is inside,” Mat said. “Captured. I mean to get her back. I have to beat the snakes and the foxes. Bloody cheats.”</p>
<p class="para">“Snakes and foxes?” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para">Thom nodded. “The children’s game is named after the things that live in the tower. So we think.”</p>
<p class="para">“I’ve seen them,” Mat said. “And…well, there’s really not time for that now.”</p>
<p class="para">“If you’re going to rescue her,” Perrin said, “perhaps I could come. Or at least send one of the Asha’man.”</p>
<p class="para">“I’ll take a gateway gladly,” Mat said. “But you can’t come, Perrin. Moiraine explained it in her letter. Only three can come, and I know already who they have to be.” He hesitated. “Olver is going to bloody kill me for not taking him, you know.”</p>
<p class="para">“Mat,” Perrin said, shaking his head. “You’re not making any sense.”</p>
<p class="para">Mat sighed. “Let me tell you the whole story, then.” He eyed the pitcher of ale. “We’re going to need more of that, and you’d better tell Grady you’ll be some time yet…”</p>
