<h3 class="h4">Birdcalls by Night</h3>
<p class="para1"><span class="big">L</span>ying facedown on his blankets with his eyes closed, Mat luxuriated in the feel of Melindhra’s thumbs kneading their way down his spine. There was nothing quite as good as a massage after a long day in the saddle. Well, some things were, but right then, he was willing to settle for her thumbs.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“You are well muscled for such a short man, Matrim Cauthon.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">He opened one eye and glanced back at her, kneeling astride his hips. She had built the fire up twice as high as needed, and sweat trickled down her body. Her fine golden hair, close-cut except for that Aiel tail at the nape of her neck, clung to her scalp. “If I’m too short, you can always find somebody else.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“You are not too short for my taste,” she laughed, ruffling his hair. It was longer than hers. “And you are cute. Relax. This does no good if you tense.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Grunting, he closed his eyes again. Cute? <em class="calibre4">Light!</em> And short. Only Aiel could call him short. In every other land he had been in, he was taller than most men, if not always by much. He could remember being tall. Taller than Rand, when he rode against Artur Hawkwing. And a hand shorter than he was now when he fought beside Maecine against the Aelgari. He had spoken to Lan, claiming he had overheard some names; the Warder said Maecine had been a king of Eharon, one of the Ten Nations—that <a id="page_330" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>much Mat already knew—some four or five hundred years before the Trolloc Wars. Lan doubted that even the Brown Ajah knew more; much had been lost in the Trolloc Wars, and more in the War of the Hundred Years. Those were the earliest and latest of the memories that had been planted in his skull. Nothing after Artur Paendrag Tanreall, and nothing before Maecine of Eharon.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Are you cold?” Melindhra said incredulously. “You shivered.” She scrambled off him, and he heard her add wood to the fire; there was enough scrub here for burning. She slapped his bottom hard as she climbed back on, murmuring, “Good muscle.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“If you keep on like that,” he muttered, “I’ll think you mean to spit me for supper, like a Trolloc.” It was not that he did not enjoy Melindhra—as long as she refrained from pointing out that she was taller, anyway—but the situation made him uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“No spits for you, Matrim Cauthon.” Her thumbs dug hard into his shoulder. “That is it. Relax.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">He supposed that he would marry someday, settle down. That was what you did. A woman, a house, a family. Shackled to one spot for the rest of his life. <em class="calibre4">I never heard of a wife yet that liked her husband having a drink or a gamble.</em> And there was what those folk on the other side of the doorframe <em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em> had said. That he was fated “to marry the Daughter of the Nine Moons.” <em class="calibre4">A man has to marry sooner or later, I suppose.</em> But he certainly did not mean to take an Aiel wife. He wanted to dance with as many women as he could, while he could.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“You are not made for spits, but for great honor, I think,” Melindhra said softly.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Sounds fine to me.” Only now he could not get another woman to look at him, not the Maidens or the others. It was as if Melindhra had hung a sign on him saying <span class="smallcaps1">OWNED BY MELINDHRA OF THE JUMAI SHAIDO</span>. Well, she would not have put that last bit on, not here. Then again, who knew what an Aiel would do, especially a Maiden of the Spear? Women did not think the same as men, and Aielwomen did not think like anybody else in the world.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“It is strange that you efface yourself so.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Efface myself?” he mumbled. Her hands did feel good; knots were coming out that he had not known were there. “How?” He wondered if it had something to do with that necklace. Melindhra seemed to set great store by it, or by receiving it, anyway. She never wore the thing, of course. <a id="page_331" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>Maidens did not. But she carried it in her pouch, and showed it to every woman who asked. A lot of them seemed to.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“You put yourself in the shadow of Rand al’Thor.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“I’m not in anybody’s shadow,” he said absently. It could not be the necklace. He had given jewelry to other women, Maidens and others; he liked giving things to pretty women, even if all he got in return was a smile. He never expected more. If a woman did not enjoy a kiss and a cuddle as much as he did, what was the point?</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Of course, there is honor of a sort in being in the shadow of the <em class="calibre4">Car’a’carn.</em> To be near the mighty, you must stand in their shade.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Shade,” Mat agreed, not really hearing. Sometimes the women accepted and sometimes not, but none had decided they owned him. That was what rankled, really. He was not about to be owned by any woman, however pretty she was. And no matter how good her hands were at loosening knotted muscles.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Your scars should be scars of honor, earned in your own name, as a chief, not this.” One finger traced along the hanging scar on his neck. “Did you earn this serving the <em class="calibre4">Car’a’carn</em>?”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Shrugging her hand away, he pushed up on his elbows and twisted to look at her. “Are you sure ‘Daughter of the Nine Moons’ doesn’t mean anything to you?”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“I have told you it does not. Lie down.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“If you are lying to me, I swear I’ll welt your rump.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Hands on hips, she looked down at him dangerously. “Do you think that you can . . . welt my rump, Mat Cauthon?”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“I’ll give it my best try.” She would probably put a spear through his ribs. “Do you swear you’ve never heard of the Daughter of the Nine Moons?”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“I never have,” she said slowly. “Who is she? Or what? Lie down, and let me—”</p>
<p class="indent-para">A blackbird called, seemingly everywhere in the tent and outside as well, and a moment later, a redwing. Good Two Rivers birds. Rand had chosen his warnings from what he knew, birds not found in the Waste.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Melindhra was off him in an instant, wrapping her <em class="calibre4">shoufa</em> around her head, veiling herself as she snatched up spears and bucklers. She darted from the tent like that.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Blood and bloody ashes!” Mat muttered as he struggled into his breeches. A redwing meant the south. He and Melindhra had put up their <a id="page_332" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>tent to the south, with the Chareen, as far from Rand as they could get and stay in the encampment. But he was not going outside in those thornbushes naked, the way Melindhra had. The blackbird meant north, where the Shaarad were camped; they were coming from two sides at once.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Stamping his feet in his boots as best he could in the low tent, he looked at the silver foxhead lying beside his blankets. Shouts were rising outside, the clash of metal on metal. He had finally figured out that that medallion had somehow kept Moiraine from Healing him on her first try. So long as he had been touching it, her channeling had not affected him. He had never heard of Shadowspawn able to channel, but there was always the Black Ajah—so Rand said, and he believed it—and always the chance that one of the Forsaken had finally come after Rand. Pulling the leather thong over his head so the medallion hung on his chest, he snatched up his raven-marked spear and ducked out into cold moonlight.</p>
<p class="indent-para">He had no time to feel the icy chill. Before he was completely out of the tent, he almost lost his head to a scythe-curved Trolloc sword. The blade brushed his hair as he threw himself into a low dive, rolling to his feet with the spear ready.</p>
<p class="indent-para">At first glance in the darkness, the Trolloc might have been a bulky man, though half again as tall as any Aiel man, garbed all in black mail with spikes at elbows and shoulders, and a helmet with goat’s horns attached. But these horns grew out of that too human head, and below the eyes a goat’s muzzle thrust out.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Snarling, the Trolloc lunged at him, and howled in a harsh language never meant for a human tongue. Mat spun his spear like a quarterstaff, knocking the heavy, curved blade to one side, and thrust his long spearpoint into the creature’s middle, mail parting for that Power-made steel as easily as the flesh beneath. The goat-snouted Trolloc folded over with a harsh cry, and Mat pulled his weapon free, dodging aside as it fell.</p>
<p class="indent-para">All around him Aiel, some unclothed or only half but all black-veiled, fought Trollocs with tusked boars’ snouts or wolves’ muzzles or eagles’ beaks, some with heads horned or crested with feathers, wielding those oddly curved swords and spiked axes, hooked tridents and spears. Here and there one used a huge bow to shoot barbed arrows the size of small spears. Men fought alongside the Trollocs, too, in rough coats, with swords, shouting desperately as they died among the thornbushes.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Sammael!”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Sammael and the Golden Bees!”</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_333" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>The Darkfriends <em class="calibre4">were</em> dying, most as soon as they engaged an Aiel, but the Trollocs died harder.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“I am no bloody hero!” Mat shouted to no one in particular as he battled a Trolloc with a bear’s muzzle and hairy ears, his third. The creature carried a long-handled axe, with half a dozen sharp spikes and a flaring blade big enough to split a tree, throwing it about like a toy in those great hairy hands. It was being near Rand that got Mat into these things. All he wanted from life was some good wine, a game of dice, and a pretty girl or three. “I don’t want to be mixed up in this!” Especially not if Sammael was around. “Do you hear me?”</p>
<p class="indent-para">The Trolloc went down with a ruined throat, and he found himself facing a Myrddraal, just as it finished killing two Aiel who had come at it together. The Halfman looked like a man, pasty pale, armored in black overlapping scales like a snake’s. It moved like a snake, too, boneless and fluid and quick, night-black cloak hanging still however it darted. And it had no eyes. Just a dead-white sweep of skin where eyes should be.</p>
<p class="indent-para">That eyeless gaze turned on him, and he shivered, fear oozing along his bones. “The look of the Eyeless is fear,” they said in the Borderlands, where they should know, and even Aiel admitted that a Myrddraal’s stare sent chills through the marrow. That was the creature’s first weapon. The Halfman came at him in a flowing run.</p>
<p class="indent-para">With a roar, Mat rushed to meet it, spear spinning like a quarterstaff, thrusting, ever moving. The thing carried a blade as dark as its cloak, a sword hammered at the forges of Thakan’dar, and if that cut him, he was as good as dead unless Moiraine appeared quickly with her Healing. But there was only one sure way to take down a Fade. All-out attack; you had to overwhelm it before it overwhelmed you, and a thought for defense could be a good way to die. He could not even spare a glance for the battle raging around him in the night.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The Myrddraal’s blade flickered like a serpent’s tongue, darted like black lightning, but to counter Mat’s attack. When raven-marked Power-wrought steel met Thakan’dar-made metal, blue light flashed around them, a crackle of sheet lightning.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Suddenly Mat’s slashing attack struck flesh. Black sword and pale hand flew away, and the reverse stroke sliced open the Myrddraal’s throat, but Mat did not stop. Thrust through the heart, cut to one hamstring, then the other, all in rapid succession. Only then did he step away from the thing still thrashing on the ground, flailing about with its good hand and severed <a id="page_334" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>stump, wounds spilling inky blood. Halfmen took a long time to admit that they were dead; they did not die completely except with a setting sun.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Looking around, Mat realized that the attack was over. Whatever Darkfriends or Trollocs were not dead, had fled; at least, he saw none standing except Aiel. Some of them were down, too. He plucked a kerchief from the neck of a Darkfriend corpse to wipe the Myrddraal’s black blood from his spearpoint. It would etch the metal if left too long.</p>
<p class="indent-para">This night assault made no sense. By the bodies he could see in the moonlight, Trolloc and human, none had made it much past the first line of tents. And without far greater numbers, they could not have hoped for more.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“What was that you called out? <em class="calibre4">Carai</em> something. The Old Tongue?”</p>
<p class="indent-para">He turned to look at Melindhra. She had unveiled, but she still wore not a stitch more than her <em class="calibre4">shoufa.</em> There were other Maidens about, and men, wearing as little, and showing as little concern, though most did seem to be heading back to their tents without lingering. They had no modesty, that was it. No modesty at all. She did not even seem to feel the cold, though her breath made wisps of mist. He was as sweaty as she, and freezing now that he had no fight for his life to occupy his mind.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Something I heard once,” he told her. “I liked the sound of it.” <em class="calibre4">Carai an Caldazar!</em> For the honor of the Red Eagle. The battle cry of Manetheren. Most of his memories were from Manetheren. Some of those he had had before the twisted doorway. Moiraine said it was the Old Blood coming out. Just as long as it did not come out of his veins.</p>
<p class="indent-para">She put an arm around his shoulders as he started back toward their tent. “I saw you with the Nightrunner, Mat Cauthon.” That was one of the Aiel names for Myrddraal. “You are as tall as a man needs to be.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Grinning, he slipped his arm around her waist, but he could not get the attack out of his head. He wanted to—his thoughts were too snarled in his borrowed memories—but he could not. Why had anyone launched such a hopeless assault? No one but a fool attacked overwhelming force without a reason. That was the thought he could not pry out of his head. No one attacked without a reason.</p>
<p class="linespace"> </p>
<p class="para1">The birdcalls pulled Rand awake immediately, and he seized <em class="calibre4">saidin</em> as he tossed the blankets aside and ran out, coatless, in his stockinged feet. The night was cold and moonlit, faint sounds of battle drifting up from the hills below the pass. Around him, Aiel stirred like scurrying ants, rushing into the <a id="page_335" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>night to where an attack might come here in the pass. The wards would signal again—Shadowspawn in the pass would cause a winterfinch to call—until he unraveled them in the morning, but there was no point in taking foolish chances.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Soon the pass was still again, the <em class="calibre4">gai’shain</em> in their tents, forbidden weapons even now, the other Aiel off at the places that might need defending. Even Adelin and the other Maidens had gone, as if they knew he would have held them back if they waited. He could hear a few mutters from the wagons near the town walls, but neither the drivers nor Kadere showed themselves; he did not expect them to. The faint sounds of battle—men shouting, screaming, dying—came from two directions. Both below, well away from him. People were out around the Wise Ones’ tents, too; staring toward the fighting, it seemed.</p>
<p class="indent-para">An attack down there made no sense. It was not the Miagoma, not unless Timolan had taken Shadowspawn into his clan, and that was as likely as Whitecloaks recruiting Trollocs. He turned back toward his tent, and even enclosed in the Void he gave a start.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Aviendha had come out into the moonlight, a blanket wrapped around her. Just beyond her stood a tall man shrouded in a dark cloak; moonshadows drifted over a gaunt face that was too pale, with eyes too large. A crooning rose, and the cloak opened into wide, leathery wings like those of a bat. Moving as in a dream, Aviendha drifted toward the waiting embrace.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Rand channeled, and finger-thin balefire burned past her, an arrow of solid light, to take the Draghkar in the head. The effect of that narrower stream was slower, but no less sure than with the Darkhounds. The creature’s colors reversed, black to white, white to black, and it became sparkling motes that melted in air.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Aviendha shook herself as the crooning ended, stared at the last particles as they vanished, and turned to Rand, gathering the blanket closer. Her hand came up, and a stream of fire as thick as his head roared toward him.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Startled even inside the emptiness, never thinking of the Power, he threw himself to the ground beneath the billowing flames. They died in an instant.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“What are you doing?” he barked, so angry, so shocked, that the Void cracked and <em class="calibre4">saidin</em> vanished from him. He scrambled to his feet, stalking toward her. “This tops any ingratitude I ever heard of!” He was going to shake her until her teeth rattled. “I just saved your life, in case you failed to notice, and if I offended some bloody Aiel custom, I don’t give a—!”</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_336" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>“The next time,” she snapped back, “I will leave the great <em class="calibre4">Car’a’carn</em> to deal with matters by himself!” Awkwardly clutching the blanket close, she ducked stiff-backed into the tent.</p>
<p class="indent-para">For the first time, he looked behind him. At another Draghkar, crumpled on the ground in flames. He had been so angry that he had not heard the crackling and popping as it burned, had not smelled the odor of burning grease. He had not even sensed the evil of it. A Draghkar killed by first sucking the soul away, and then life. It had to be close, touching, but this one lay no more than two paces from where he had been standing. He was not certain how effective a Draghkar’s crooning embrace was against someone filled with <em class="calibre4">saidin,</em> but he was glad he had not found out.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Drawing a deep breath, he knelt beside the tent flap. “Aviendha?” He could not go in. A lamp was lit in there, and she could be sitting there naked for all he knew, mentally ripping him up and down the way he deserved. “Aviendha, I am sorry. I apologize. I was a fool to speak as I did without asking why. I should know that you wouldn’t harm me, and I . . . I . . . I’m a fool,” he finished weakly.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“A great deal you know, Rand al’Thor,” came a muffled reply. “You <em class="calibre4">are</em> a fool!”</p>
<p class="indent-para">How <em class="calibre4">did</em> Aiel apologize? He had never asked her that. Considering <em class="calibre4">ji’e’toh,</em> teaching men to sing, and wedding customs, he did not think he would. “Yes, I am. And I apologize.” There was no answer this time. “Are you in your blankets?” Silence.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Muttering to himself, he stood, working his stockinged toes on the icy ground. He was going to have to remain out here until he was sure she was decently covered. Without boots or coat. He seized hold of <em class="calibre4">saidin,</em> taint and all, just to be distanced from the bone-grinding cold, inside the Void.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The three Wise One dreamwalkers came running, of course, and Egwene, all staring at the burning Draghkar as they skirted it, drawing their shawls around them with almost the same motion.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Only one,” Amys said. “I thank the Light, but I am surprised.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“There were two,” Rand told her. “I . . . destroyed the other.” Why should he be hesitant just because Moiraine had warned him against bale-fire? It was a weapon like any other. “If Aviendha had not killed this one, it might have gotten me.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“The feel of her channeling drew us,” Egwene said, looking him up and down. At first he thought she was checking for injuries, but she paid special attention to his stockinged feet, then glanced at the tent, where a crack in the tent flap showed lamplight. “You’ve upset her again, haven’t <a id="page_337" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>you? She saved your life, and you . . . Men!” With a disgusted shake of her head, she brushed past him and into the tent. He heard faint voices, but could not make out what was being said.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Melaine gave a hitch to her shawl. “If you do not need us, then we must see what is happening below.” She hurried off without waiting for the other two.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Bair cackled as she and Amys followed. “A wager on who she will check on first? My amethyst necklace that you like so much against that sapphire bracelet of yours?”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Done. I choose Dorindha.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">The older Wise One cackled again. “Her eyes are still full of Bael. A first-sister is a first-sister, but a new husband . . .”</p>
<p class="indent-para">They moved on out of earshot, and he bent toward the tent flap. He still could not hear what they were saying, not unless he stuck his ear to the crack, and he was not about to do that. Surely Aviendha had covered herself with Egwene in there. Then again, the way Egwene had taken to Aiel ways, it was just as likely she had peeled out of her clothes instead.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The soft sound of slippers announced Moiraine and Lan, and Rand straightened. Though he could hear both of them breathing, the Warder’s steps still made barely an audible noise. Moiraine’s hair hung about her face, and she held a dark robe around her, the silk shining with the moon. Lan was fully dressed, booted and armed, wrapped in that cloak that made him part of the night. Of course. The clamor of fighting was dying down in the hills below.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“I am surprised you were not here sooner, Moiraine.” His voice sounded cold, but better his voice than him. He held onto <em class="calibre4">saidin,</em> fought it, and the night’s icy chill remained something far off. He was aware of it, aware of each hair on his arms stirring with cold beneath his shirtsleeves, but it did not touch him. “You usually come looking for me as soon as you sense trouble.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“I have never explained all that I do or do not do.” Her voice was as coolly mysterious as it had ever been, yet even in the moonlight Rand was certain that she was blushing. Lan looked troubled, though with him it was difficult to tell. “I cannot hold your hand forever. Eventually, you must walk alone.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“I did that tonight, didn’t I?” Embarrassment slid across the Void—that sounded as though he had done everything himself—and he added, “Aviendha all but took that one off my back.” The flames on the Draghkar were burning low.</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_338" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>“As well she was here, then,” Moiraine said calmly. “You did not need me.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">She had not been afraid, of that he was sure. He had seen her rush into the midst of Shadowspawn, wielding the Power as skillfully as Lan did his sword, seen it too often to believe fear in her. So why had she not come when she sensed the Draghkar? She could have, and Lan as well; that was one of the gifts a Warder received from the bond between him and an Aes Sedai. He could make her tell, catch her between her oath to him and her inability to lie straight out. No, he could not. Or would not. He would not do that to someone who was trying to help him.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“At least now we know what the attack below was about,” he said. “To make me think something important was happening there while the Draghkar slipped in on me. They tried that at Cold Rocks Hold, and it did not work there either.” Only, maybe it almost had, this time. If that <em class="calibre4">had</em> been the intent. “You would think they would try something different.” Couladin ahead of him; the Forsaken everywhere, it seemed. Why could he not face one enemy at a time?</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Do not make the mistake of thinking the Forsaken simple,” Moiraine said. “That could easily be fatal.” She shifted her robe as though wishing it were thicker. “The hour is late. If you have no further need of me . . . ?”</p>
<p class="indent-para">Aiel began to drift back as she and the Warder left. Some exclaimed over the Draghkar, and roused some of the <em class="calibre4">gai’shain</em> to drag it away, but most simply looked at it before going to their tents. They seemed to expect such things of him now.</p>
<p class="indent-para">When Adelin and the Maidens appeared, their soft-booted feet dragged. They stared at the Draghkar being hauled away by white-robed men, and exchanged long looks before approaching Rand.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“There was nothing here,” Adelin said slowly. “The attack was all below, Darkfriends and Trollocs.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Shouting ‘Sammael and the Golden Bees,’ I heard,” another added. With her head wrapped in a <em class="calibre4">shoufa,</em> Rand could not make out who she was. She sounded young; some of the Maidens were no more than sixteen.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Taking a deep breath, Adelin held out one of her spears, horizontally, in front of him, rock-steady. The others did the same, one spear each. “We—I—failed,” Adelin said. “We should have been here when the Draghkar came. Instead we ran like children to dance the spears.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“What am I supposed to do with those?” Rand asked, and Adelin replied without hesitation.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Whatever you wish, <em class="calibre4">Car’a’carn.</em> We stand ready, and will not resist.”</p>
<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_339" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>Rand shook his head. <em class="calibre4">Bloody Aiel and their bloody</em> ji’e’toh. “You take those and go back to guarding my tent. Well? Go.” Looks passed between them before they began to obey, as reluctantly as they had approached him in the first place. “And one of you tell Aviendha that I will be coming in when I return,” he added. He was not going to spend the entire night outside wondering whether it was safe. He stalked away, the stony ground hard under his feet.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Asmodean’s tent was not very far from his. There had not been a sound out of it. He whipped open the flap and ducked in. Asmodean was sitting in the dark, chewing his lip. He flinched when Rand appeared, and gave him no chance to speak.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“You did not expect me to take a hand, did you? I felt the Draghkar, but you could deal with those; you did. I have never liked Draghkar; we should never have made them. They have fewer brains than a Trolloc. Give them an order, and they still sometimes kill whatever is closest. If I had come out, if I had done something. . . . What if someone noticed? What if they realized it could not be you channeling? I—”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“Well for you that you didn’t,” Rand cut him off, sitting cross-legged in the dark. “If I had felt you full of <em class="calibre4">saidin</em> out there tonight, I might have killed you.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">The other man’s laugh was shaky. “I thought of that, too.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“It was Sammael who sent the attack tonight. The Trollocs and Darkfriends, anyway.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“It is not like Sammael to throw men away,” Asmodean said slowly. “But he’ll see ten thousand dead, or ten times that, if it gains him what he thinks is worth the cost. Maybe one of the others wants you to think it was him. Even if the Aiel took prisoners . . . Trollocs do not think of much besides killing, and Darkfriends believe what they are told.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“It was him. He tried to bait me into attacking him once in the same way, at Serendahar.” <em class="calibre4">Oh, Light!</em> The thought drifted across the surface of the Void. <em class="calibre4">I said “me.”</em> He did not know where Serendahar had been, or anything but what he had said. The words had just come out.</p>
<p class="indent-para">After a long silence, Asmodean said quietly, “I never knew that.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“What I want to know is, why?” Rand chose his words carefully, hoping that they were all his. He remembered Sammael’s face, a man—<em class="calibre4">Not mine. Not my memory</em>—a compact man with a short yellow beard. Asmodean had described all the Forsaken, but he knew this image was not made from that description. Sammael had always wanted to be taller, and resented it that the Power could not make him so. Asmodean had never told <a id="page_340" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>him that. “From what you’ve told me, he is not likely to want to face me unless he is sure of victory, and maybe not then. You said he’d likely leave me to the Dark One, if he could. So why is he sure he’ll win now, if I decide to go after him?”</p>
<p class="indent-para">They discussed it in the dark for hours without coming to any conclusion. Asmodean held to the opinion that it had been one of the others, hoping to send Rand against Sammael and thus get rid of one or both; at least, Asmodean said that he did. Rand could feel the man’s dark eyes on him, wondering. That slip had been too big to cover.</p>
<p class="indent-para">When he finally returned to his own tent, Adelin and the dozen Maidens all sprang to their feet, all of them at once telling him that Egwene was gone and Aviendha long asleep, that she was angry with him, they both were. They gave so many different pieces of advice on handling the two women’s anger, all at the same time, that he could understand none of it. Finally they fell silent, looks passing between them, and Adelin spoke alone.</p>
<p class="indent-para">“We must speak of tonight. Of what we did, and what we failed to do. We—”</p>
<p class="indent-para">“It was nothing,” he told her, “and if it was something, it’s forgiven and forgotten. I would like to have a few hours’ sleep for once. If you want to discuss it go talk to Amys or Bair. I am sure they’ll understand what you’re after more than I do.” That shut them up, surprisingly, and let him get inside.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Aviendha was in her blankets, with one slim, bare leg sticking out. He tried not to look at it, or her. She had left a lamp lit. He climbed into his own blankets gratefully and channeled the lamp out before releasing <em class="calibre4">saidin.</em> This time he dreamed of Aviendha hurling fire, only she was not hurling it at a Draghkar, and Sammael was sitting at her side, laughing.</p>
