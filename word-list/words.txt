The
black-clad
man’s
eyes
widened,
darted
to
the
body
of
the
golden-haired
woman,
then
back
to
Lews
Therin.
“Shai’tan
take
you,
does
the
taint
already
have
you
so
far
in
its
grip?”

“That
name.
Shai—”
Lews
Therin
shuddered
and
raised
a
hand
as
though
to
ward
off
something.
“You
mustn’t
say
that
name.
It
is
dangerous.”
