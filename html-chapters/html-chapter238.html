<div class="subtitle-chapter"><span class="calibre2"><span class="calibre18">Beyond the Stone</span></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">E</span>gwene stumbled, flinging her arms around Mist’s neck as the ground tilted under her feet. All about her, Aiel contended with braying, sliding pack mules on a steep rocky slope where nothing grew. Heat remembered from <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span> hammered her. The air shimmered before her eyes: the ground burned her feet through the soles of her shoes. Her skin prickled painfully for a moment, then sweat gushed from every pore. It only dampened her dress, and the sweat seemed to evaporate immediately.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The struggling mules and tall Aiel nearly hid the surroundings from her, but she saw a bit in flashes between them. A thick gray stone column angled out of the ground not three paces from her, scoured by windblown sand until there was no telling whether it had ever been twin to the Portal Stone in Tear. Rugged slab-sided mountains that looked carved by a mad giant’s axe broiled beneath a blazing sun in a cloudless sky. Yet in the center of the long, barren valley far below, a mass of dense fog hung, billowing like clouds; that scalding sun should surely have burned it off in moments, but the fog rolled untouched. And out of that roiling gray stuck the tops of towers, some spired, some ending abruptly as though the masons still worked.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He was right,” she murmured to herself. “A city in clouds.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Clutching his gelding’s bridle, Mat was staring around wide-eyed. “We
made it!” He laughed at her. “We made it, Egwene, and without any . . . . Burn me, we made it!” He tugged open his shirt laces at the neck. “Light, it’s hot. Burn me for true!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Abruptly she realized Rand was on his knees, head down, supporting himself with one hand on the ground. Pulling her mare behind her, she pushed through the milling Aiel to him just as Lan helped him to his feet. Moiraine was already there, studying Rand with apparent calm—and the slight tightness at the corners of her mouth that meant she would like to box his ears.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I did it,” Rand panted, looking around. The Warder was all that was holding him upright; his face was drained and drawn, like a man on his deathbed.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You came close,” Moiraine said coolly. Very coolly. “The <span class="calibre18">angreal</span> was not sufficient to the task. You must not do this again. If you take chances, they must be reasoned and for a strong purpose. They must be.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I don’t take chances, Moiraine. Mat’s the fellow for chances.” Rand forced his right hand open; the <span class="calibre18">angreal</span>, the fat little man, had driven the point of its sword into his flesh, right into the branded heron. “Maybe you’re right. Maybe I did need one a little stronger. A little bit, maybe . . . .” He gave a huffing laugh. “It worked, Moiraine. That is what’s important. I’ve outrun them all. It worked.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“That is what matters,” Lan said, nodding.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene made a vexed <span class="calibre18">tsk.</span> Men. One almost killed himself, then tried to make a joke of it, and another told him he had done the right thing. Did they never grow up?</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The fatigue of channeling is not like other tiredness,” Moiraine said. “I cannot rid you of it completely, not when you have channeled as much as you did, but I will do what I can. Perhaps what remains will remind you to be more careful in future.” She <span class="calibre18">was</span> angry; there was a definite hint of satisfaction in her voice.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The glow of <span class="calibre18">saidar</span> surrounded the Aes Sedai as she reached up to take Rand’s head in her hands. A shuddering gasp burst out of him, and he shivered uncontrollably, then jerked back from her, pulling free of Lan as well.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Ask, Moiraine,” Rand said coldly, stuffing the <span class="calibre18">angreal</span> into his belt pouch. “Ask, first. I’m not your pet dog that you can do whatever you want to whenever you want.” He scrubbed his hands together to rub away the tiny trickle of blood.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene made that vexed sound again. Childish, and ungrateful to
boot. He could stand by himself now, though his eyes still looked weary, and she did not have to see his palm to know the tiny puncture was gone as if it had never been. Purely ungrateful. Surprisingly, Lan did not call him down for speaking to Moiraine in that fashion.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">It came to her that the Aiel had gone absolutely still now that they had the mules quieted. They stared outward warily, not toward the valley and the fog-shrouded city that must be Rhuidean, but at two camps, one to either side of them perhaps half a mile away. The two clusters of dozens upon dozens of low, open-sided tents, one twice as large as the other, clung to the mountain slope and very nearly disappeared against it, but the gray-brown Aiel in each camp were clearly visible, short spears and arrow-nocked horn bows in hand, veiling themselves if they were not already. They seemed poised on the balls of their feet, ready to attack.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The peace of Rhuidean,” a woman’s voice called from upslope, and Egwene could feel the tension leaving the Aiel surrounding her. Those among the tents began lowering their veils, though they still watched cautiously.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">There was a third, much smaller encampment farther up the mountain, she realized, a few of the low tents on a small level patch. Four women were walking down from that camp, sedate and dignified in dark bulky skirts and loose white blouses, with brown or gray shawls around their shoulders despite heat that was beginning to make Egwene feel light-headed, and many necklaces and bracelets of ivory and gold. Two had white hair, one hair the color of the sun, flowing down their backs to the waist and held back from their faces by folded kerchiefs tied around the forehead.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene recognized one of the white-haired women: Amys, the Wise One she had met in <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod.</span> Again she was struck by the contrast between Amys’s sun-darkened features and her snowy hair; the Wise One just did not look old enough. The second white-haired woman had a creased grandmotherly face, and one of the others, with gray-streaked dark hair, seemed almost as old. She was sure all four were Wise Ones, very likely the same who had signed that letter to Moiraine.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Aiel women stopped ten paces upslope from the gathering around the Portal Stone, and the grandmotherly woman spread her open hands, speaking in an aged yet powerful voice. “The peace of Rhuidean be on you. Who comes to Chaendaer may return to their holds in peace. There shall be no blood on the ground.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">With that the Aiel from Tear began to separate, quickly apportioning
the pack animals and the contents of the hampers. They were not dividing by societies now; Egwene saw Maidens going with several groups, some of which immediately began making their way around the mountain, avoiding each other and the camps, peace of Rhuidean or no. Others strode toward one or the other large cluster of tents, where finally weapons were being put down.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Not everyone had been sure of the peace of Rhuidean. Lan released the hilt of his still-sheathed sword, although Egwene had not seen him put his hands on it, and Mat hastily slipped a pair of knives back into his sleeves. Rand stood with his thumbs tucked behind his belt, but there was clear relief in his eyes.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene looked for Aviendha, to ask a few questions before she approached Amys. Surely the Aiel woman would be a little more forthcoming about the Wise Ones here, in her own land. She spotted the Maiden, carrying a large clinking jute sack, and two rolled wall hangings over her shoulder, as she started briskly for one of the big encampments.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You will stay, Aviendha,” the Wise One with gray streaks in her hair said loudly. Aviendha stopped in her tracks, not looking at anyone.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene started to go to her, but Moiraine murmured, “Best not to interfere. I doubt she will want sympathy, or see anything else if you offer it.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene nodded in spite of herself. Aviendha did look as if she wanted to be left alone. What did the Wise Ones want with her? Had she broken some rule, some law?</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She herself would not have minded some more company. She felt very exposed standing there with no Aiel around her, and all those among the tents watching. The Aiel who had come from the Stone had been courteous even when not exactly friendly; the watchers looked neither. It was a temptation to embrace <span class="calibre18">saidar.</span> Only Moiraine, serene and cool as ever despite perspiration on her face, and Lan, as unperturbed as the rocks around them, kept her from it. They would know if there was danger. As long as they accepted the situation, she would. But she did wish those Aiel would stop staring.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rhuarc climbed the slope with a smile. “I am come back, Amys, though not by the way you expected, I will wager.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I knew you would be here today, shade of my heart.” She reached up to touch his cheek, letting her brown shawl fall down onto her arms. “My sister-wife sends her heart to you.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“That’s what you meant about Dreaming,” Egwene said softly to Moiraine. Lan was the only other close enough to hear. “That’s why you were
willing to let Rand try to bring us here by Portal Stone. They knew about it, and told you in that letter. No, that doesn’t make sense. If they had mentioned a Portal Stone, you wouldn’t have tried talking him out of it. They knew we’d be here, though.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine nodded without taking her eyes from the Wise Ones. “They wrote that they would meet us here, on Chaendaer, today. I thought it . . . unlikely . . . until Rand mentioned the Stones. When he was sure—certain beyond my dissuading—that one existed here . . . . Let us just say it suddenly seemed <span class="calibre18">very</span> likely we would reach Chaendaer today.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene took a deep breath of hot air. So that was one of the things Dreamers could do. She could not wait to start learning. She wanted to go after Rhuarc and introduce herself to Amys—reintroduce herself—but Rhuarc and Amys were looking into one another’s eyes in a way that excluded intruders.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">A man had come out from each of the camps, one tall and broad-shouldered, flame-haired and still short of his middle years, the other older and darker, no less tall but more slender. They stopped a few paces to either side of Rhuarc and the Wise Ones. The older, leathery-faced man carried no visible weapon except his heavy-bladed belt knife, but the other carried spears and hide buckler, and held his head high with a fiercely prideful scowl directed at Rhuarc.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rhuarc ignored him, turning to the older man. “I see you, Heirn. Has one of the sept chiefs decided I am already dead? Who seeks to take my place?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I see you, Rhuarc. No one of the Taardad has entered Rhuidean, or seeks to. Amys said she would come meet you here today, and these other Wise Ones traveled with her. I brought these men of the Jindo sept to see they arrived safely.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rhuarc nodded solemnly. Egwene had the feeling something important had just been said, or hinted at. The Wise Ones did not look at the fiery-haired man, and neither did Rhuarc or Heirn, but from the color rising in the fellow’s cheeks, they might as well have been staring at him. She glanced at Moiraine and got a tiny shake of the head; the Aes Sedai did not understand either.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Lan leaned down between them, speaking quietly. “A Wise One can go anywhere safely, into any hold regardless of clan. I think not even blood feud touches a Wise One. This Heirn came to protect Rhuarc from whoever the other camp is, but it would not be honorable to say it.” Moiraine lifted one eyebrow a trifle, and he added, “I don’t know much of them, but
I fought them often before I met you. You have never asked me about them.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I will remedy that,” the Aes Sedai said dryly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Turning back to the Wise Ones and the three men made Egwene’s head swim. Lan pushed an unstoppered leather water bottle into her hands, and she tilted her head back to drink gratefully. The water was lukewarm and smelled of leather, but in the heat it tasted fresh from the spring. She offered the half-empty bottle to Moiraine, who drank sparingly and handed it back. Egwene was glad to gulp down the rest, closing her eyes; water splashed over her head, and she opened them again quickly. Lan was emptying another water bottle over her, and Moiraine’s hair already dripped.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“This heat can kill if you are not used to it,” the Warder explained as he wet down a pair of plain white linen scarves pulled from his coat. At his instructions, she and Moiraine tied the soaked cloths around their foreheads. Rand and Mat were doing the same. Lan left his own head unprotected to the sun; nothing seemed to faze the man.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The silence between Rhuarc and the Aielmen with him had stretched out, but the clan chief finally turned to the flame-haired man. “Do the Shaido lack a clan chief, then, Couladin?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Suladric is dead,” the man answered. “Muradin has entered Rhuidean. Should he fail, I will enter.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You have not asked, Couladin,” the grandmotherly Wise One said in that reedy yet strong voice. “Should Muradin fail, ask then. We are four, enough to say yes or no.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It is my right, Bair,” Couladin said angrily. He had the look of a man not used to being balked.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It is your right to ask,” the thin-voiced woman replied. “It is ours to answer. I do not think you will be allowed to enter, whatever happens to Muradin. You are flawed within, Couladin.” She shifted her gray shawl, rewrapping it around her angular shoulders in a way that suggested she had said more than she considered necessary.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The flame-haired man’s face grew red. “My first-brother will return marked as clan chief, and we will lead the Shaido to great honor! We mean to—!” He snapped his mouth shut, almost quivering.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene thought she would keep an eye on him if he remained anywhere close to her. He reminded her of the Congars and the Coplins back home, full of boasts and trouble. She had certainly never before seen any Aiel display so much raw emotion.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Amys seemed to have dismissed him already. “There is one who came with you, Rhuarc,” she said. Egwene expected the woman to speak to her, but Amys’s eyes swept straight to Rand. Moiraine was obviously not surprised. Egwene wondered what had been in that letter from these four Wise Ones that the Aes Sedai had not revealed.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand looked taken aback for a moment, hesitating, but then he strode up the slope to stand near Rhuarc at eye level to the women. Sweat plastered his white shirt to his body and made darker patches on his breeches. With a twisted white cloth tied around his head, he certainly did not look so grand as he had in the Heart of the Stone. He made an odd bow, left foot advanced, left hand on knee, right hand outstretched palm upward.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“By the right of blood,” he said, “I ask leave to enter Rhuidean, for the honor of our ancestors and the memory of what was.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Amys blinked in evident surprise, and Bair murmured, “An ancient form, but the question has been asked. I answer yes.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I also answer yes, Bair,” Amys said. “Seana?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“This man is no Aiel,” Couladin broke in angrily. Egwene suspected he was very nearly always angry. “It is death for him to be on this ground! Why has Rhuarc brought him? Why—?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Do you wish to be a Wise One, Couladin?” Bair asked, a frown deepening the creases on her face. “Put on a dress and come to me, and I will see if you can be trained. Until then, be silent when Wise Ones speak!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“My mother was Aiel,” Rand said in a strained voice.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene stared at him. Kari al’Thor had died while Egwene was barely out of her cradle, but if Tam’s wife had been Aiel, Egwene would certainly have heard of it. She glanced at Moiraine; the Aes Sedai was watching, smooth-faced, calm. Rand did look a great deal like the Aielmen, with his height and gray-blue eyes and reddish hair, but this was ridiculous.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Not your mother,” Amys said slowly. “Your father.” Egwene shook her head. This approached madness. Rand opened his mouth, but Amys did not let him speak. “Seana, how do you say?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Yes,” the woman with gray-streaked hair said. “Melaine?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The last of the four, a handsome woman with golden-red hair, no more than ten or fifteen years older than Egwene, hesitated. “It must be done,” she said finally, and unwillingly. “I answer yes.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You have been answered,” Amys told Rand. “You may go into Rhuidean, and—” She cut off as Mat scrambled up to copy Rand’s bow awkwardly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I also ask to enter Rhuidean,” he said shakily.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The four Wise Ones stared at him. Rand’s head whipped around in
surprise. Egwene thought no one could be more shocked than she was, but Couladin proved her wrong. Lifting one of his spears with a snarl, he stabbed at Mat’s chest.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The glow of <span class="calibre18">saidar</span> surrounded Amys and Melaine, and flows of Air lifted the fiery-haired man and flung him back a dozen paces.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene stared, wide-eyed. They could channel. At least, two of them could. Suddenly Amys’s youthfully smooth features beneath that white hair leaped out at her for what they were, something very close to Aes Sedai agelessness. Moiraine was absolutely still. Egwene could almost hear her thoughts buzzing, though. This was plainly as much of a surprise to the Aes Sedai as to herself.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Couladin scrambled to his feet in a crouch. “You accept this outlander as one of us,” he rasped, pointing at Rand with the spear he had attempted to use on Mat. “If you say it, then so be it. He is still a soft wetlander, and Rhuidean will kill him.” The spear swung to Mat, who was trying to slip a knife back up his sleeve without being noticed. “But he—it is death for him to be here, and sacrilege for him to even <span class="calibre18">ask</span> to enter Rhuidean. None but those of the blood may enter. None!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Go back to your tents, Couladin,” Melaine said coldly. “And you, Heirn. And you, as well, Rhuarc. This is business of Wise Ones, and none of men save those who have asked. Go!” Rhuarc and Heirn nodded and walked away toward the smaller set of tents, talking together. Couladin glared at Rand and Mat, and at the Wise Ones, before jerking around and stalking off toward the larger camp.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Wise Ones exchanged glances. Troubled glances, Egwene would have said, though they were almost as good as Aes Sedai at keeping their faces blank when they wanted to.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It is not permitted,” Amys said finally. “Young man, you do not know what you have done. Go back with the others.” Her eyes brushed across Egwene and Moiraine and Lan, standing alone now with the horses near the wind-scoured Portal Stone. Egwene could not find any recognition for her in that glance.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I can’t.” Mat sounded desperate. “I’ve come this far, but this doesn’t count, does it? I have to go to Rhuidean.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It is not permitted,” Melaine said sharply, her long red-gold hair swinging as she shook her head. “You have no Aiel blood in your veins.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand had been studying Mat all this time. “He comes with me,” he said suddenly. “You gave me permission, and he can come with me whether you say he can or not.” He stared back at the Wise Ones, not defiantly,
merely determined, set in his mind. Egwene knew him like this; he would not back down whatever they said.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It is not permitted,” Melaine said firmly, addressing her sisters. She pulled her shawl up to cover her head. “The law is clear. No woman may go to Rhuidean more than twice, no man more than once, and none at all save they have the blood of Aiel.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Seana shook her head. “Much is changing, Melaine. The old ways . . . .”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“If he is the one,” Bair said, “the Time of Change is upon us. Aes Sedai stand on Chaendaer, and <span class="calibre18">Aan’allein</span> with his shifting cloak. Can we hold to the old ways still? Knowing how much is to change?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We cannot hold,” Amys said. “All stands on the edge of change, now. Melaine?” The golden-haired woman looked at the mountains around them, and the fog-shrouded city below, then sighed and nodded. “It is done,” Amys said, turning to Rand and Mat. “You,” she began, then paused. “By what name do you call yourself?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Rand al’Thor.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Mat. Mat Cauthon.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Amys nodded. “You, Rand al’Thor, must go into the heart of Rhuidean, to the very center. If you wish to go with him, Mat Cauthon, so be it, but know that most men who enter Rhuidean’s heart do not come back, and some return mad. You may carry neither food nor water, in remembrance of our wanderings after the Breaking. You must go to Rhuidean unarmed, save with your hands and your own heart, to honor the Jenn. If you have weapons, place them on the ground before us. They will be here for you when you return. If you return.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand unsheathed his belt knife and laid it at Amys’s feet, then after a moment added the green stone carving of the round little man. “That is the best I can do,” he said.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Mat began with his belt knife and kept right on, pulling knives from his sleeves and under his coat, even one from down the back of his neck, fashioning a pile that seemed to impress even the Aiel women. He made as if to stop, looked at the women, then took two more from each boot top. “I forgot them,” he said with a grin and shrug. The Wise Ones’ unblinking looks wiped his grin away.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“They are pledged to Rhuidean,” Amys said formally, looking over the men’s heads, and the other three responded together, “Rhuidean belongs to the dead.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“They may not speak to the living until they return,” she intoned, and again the others answered. “The dead do not speak to the living.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We do not see them, until they stand among the living once more.” Amys drew her shawl across her eyes, and one by one the other three did the same. Faces hidden, they spoke in unison. “Begone from among the living, and do not haunt us with memories of what is lost. Speak not of what the dead see.” Silent then, they stood there, holding their shawls up, waiting.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand and Mat looked at one another. Egwene wanted to go to them, to speak to them—they wore the fixed too-steady faces of men who did not want anyone to know they were uneasy or afraid—but that might break the ceremony.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Finally Mat barked a laugh. “Well, I suppose the dead can talk to each other, at least. I wonder if this counts for . . . . No matter. Do you suppose it’s all right if we ride?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I don’t think so,” Rand said. “I think we have to walk.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Oh, burn my aching feet. We might as well get on with it then. It’ll take half the afternoon just to get there. If we’re lucky.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand gave Egwene a reassuring smile as they started down the mountain, as if to convince her there was no danger, nothing untoward. Mat’s grin was the sort he wore when doing something particularly foolish, like trying to dance on the peak of a roof.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You aren’t going to do anything . . . <span class="calibre18">crazy</span> . . . are you?” Mat said. “I mean to come back alive.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“So do I,” Rand replied. “So do I.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">They passed from hearing, growing smaller and smaller as they descended. When they had dwindled to tiny shapes, barely distinguishable as people, the Wise Ones lowered their shawls.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Straightening her dress, and wishing she were not so sweaty, Egwene climbed the short distance to them leading Mist. “Amys? I am Egwene al’Vere. You said I should—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Amys cut her off with a raised hand, and looked to where Lan was leading Mandarb and Pips and Jeade’en, behind Moiraine and Aldieb. “This is women’s business, now, <span class="calibre18">Aan’allein.</span> You must stand aside. Go to the tents. Rhuarc will offer you water and shade.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Lan waited for Moiraine’s slight nod before bowing and walking off in the direction Rhuarc had gone. The shifting cloak hanging down his back sometimes gave him the appearance of a disembodied head and arms floating across the ground ahead of the three horses.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Why do you call him that?” Moiraine asked when he was out of earshot. “One Man. Do you know him?”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We know of him, Aes Sedai.” Amys made the title sound an address between equals. “The last of the Malkieri. The man who will not give up his war against the Shadow though his nation is long destroyed by it. There is much honor in him. I knew from the dream that if you came, it was almost certain <span class="calibre18">Aan’allein</span> would as well, but I did not know he obeyed you.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He is my Warder,” Moiraine said simply.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene thought the Aes Sedai was troubled despite her tone, and she knew why. <span class="calibre18">Almost</span> certain Lan would come with Moiraine? Lan always followed Moiraine; he would follow her into the Pit of Doom without blinking. Nearly as interesting to Egwene was <span class="calibre18">“if you came.”</span> Had the Wise Ones known they were coming or not? Perhaps interpreting the Dream was not as straightforward as she hoped. She was about to ask, when Bair spoke.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Aviendha? Come here.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Aviendha had been squatting disconsolately off to one side, arms wrapped around her knees, staring at the ground. She stood slowly. If Egwene had not known better, she would have thought the other woman was afraid. Aviendha’s feet dragged as she climbed to where the Wise Ones stood and set her bag and rolled wall hangings at her feet.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It is time,” Bair said, not ungently. Still, there was no compromise in her pale blue eyes. “You have run with the spears as long as you can. Longer than you should have.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Aviendha flung up her head defiantly. “I am a Maiden of the Spear. I do not want to be a Wise One. I will not be!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Wise Ones’ faces hardened. Egwene was reminded of the Women’s Circle back home confronting a woman who was heading off into some foolishness.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You have already been treated more gently than it was in my day,” Amys said in a voice like stone. “I, too, refused when called. My spear sisters broke my spears before my eyes. They took me to Bair and Coedelin bound hand and foot and wearing only my skin.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“And a pretty little doll tucked under your arm,” Bair said dryly, “to remind you how childish you were. As I remember, you ran away nine times in the first month.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Amys nodded grimly. “And was made to blubber like a child for each of them. I only ran away five times the second month. I thought I was as strong and hard as a woman could be. I was not smart, though; it took me half a year to learn you were stronger and harder than I could ever be, Bair. Eventually I learned my duty, my obligation to the people. As you will,
Aviendha. Such as you and I, we have that obligation. You are not a child. It is time to put away dolls—and spears—and become the woman you are meant to be.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Abruptly, Egwene knew why she had felt such a kinship with Aviendha from the first, knew why Amys and the others meant her to be a Wise One. Aviendha could channel. Like herself, like Elayne and Nynaeve—and Moiraine, for that matter—she was one of those rare women who not only could be taught to channel, but who had the ability born in her, so she would touch the True Source eventually whether she knew what she was doing or not. Moiraine’s face was still, calm, but Egwene saw confirmation in her eyes. The Aes Sedai had surely known from the first time she came within arm’s reach of the Aiel woman. Egwene realized she could feel that same kinship with Amys and Melaine. Not with Bair or Seana, though. Only the first two could channel; she was sure of it. And now she could sense the same in Moiraine. It was the first time she had ever felt that. The Aes Sedai was a distant woman.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Some of the Wise Ones, at least, apparently saw more in Moiraine’s face. “You meant to take her to your White Tower,” Bair said, “to make her one of you. She is Aiel, Aes Sedai.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“She can be very strong if she is trained properly,” Moiraine replied. “As strong as Egwene will be. In the Tower, she can reach that strength.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We can teach her as well, Aes Sedai.” Melaine’s voice was smooth enough, but contempt tinged her unwavering green-eyed stare. “Better. I have spoken with Aes Sedai. You coddle women in the Tower. The Three-fold Land is no place for coddling. Aviendha will learn what she can do while you would still have her playing games.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene gave Aviendha a concerned look; the other woman was staring at her feet, defiance gone. If they thought training in the Tower was <span class="calibre18">coddling.</span> . . . She had been worked harder and disciplined more strictly as a novice than ever before in her life. She felt a true pang of sympathy for the Aiel woman.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Amys held out her hands, and Aviendha reluctantly laid her spears and buckler in them, flinching when the Wise One threw them aside to clatter on the ground. Slowly Aviendha slid her cased bow from her back and surrendered it, unbuckled the belt holding her quiver and sheathed knife. Amys took each offering and tossed it away like rubbish; Aviendha gave a little jerk each time. A tear trembled at the corner of one blue-green eye.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Do you have to treat her this way?” Egwene demanded angrily. Amys
and the others turned flat stares on her, but she was not about to be intimidated. “You are treating things she cares about as trash.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“She must see them as trash,” Seana said. “When she returns—if she returns—she will burn them and scatter the ashes. The metal she will give to a smith to make simple things. Not weapons. Not even a carving knife. Buckles, or pots, or puzzles for children. Things she will give away with her own hands when they are made.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The Three-fold Land is not soft, Aes Sedai,” Bair said. “Soft things die, here.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The <span class="calibre18">cadin’sor</span>, Aviendha.” Amys gestured to the discarded weapons. “Your new clothes will await your return.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Mechanically, Aviendha stripped, tossing coat and breeches, soft boots, everything onto the pile. Naked, she stood without wriggling a toe, though Egwene thought her own feet would blister through her shoes. She remembered watching as the clothes she had worn to the White Tower were burned, a severing of ties to an earlier life, but it had not been like this. Not this stark.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">When Aviendha started to add the sack and the wall hangings to the pile, Seana took them from her. “These you can have back. If you return. If not, they will go to your family, for remembrance.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Aviendha nodded. She did not seem afraid. Reluctant, angry, even sullen, but not afraid.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“In Rhuidean,” Amys said, “you will find three rings, arranged so.” She drew three lines in the air, joining together in the middle. “Step through any one. You will see your future laid before you, again and again, in variation. They will not guide you wholly, as is best, for they will fade together as do stories heard long ago, yet you will remember enough to know some things that must be, for you, despised as they may be, and some that must not, cherished hopes that they are. This is the beginning of being called wise. Some women never return from the rings; perhaps they could not face the future. Some who survive the rings do not survive their second trip to Rhuidean, to the heart. You are not giving up a hard and dangerous life for a softer, but for a harder and more dangerous.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">A <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal.</span> Amys was describing a <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal.</span> What kind of place was this Rhuidean? Egwene found herself wanting to go down there herself, to find out. That was foolish. She was not here to take unnecessary risks with <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal</span> she knew nothing about.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Melaine cupped Aviendha’s chin and turned the younger woman’s face
to her. “You have the strength,” she said with quiet conviction. “A strong mind and a strong heart are your weapons now, but you hold them as surely as you ever held a spear. Remember them, use them, and they will see you through anything.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene was surprised. Of the four, she would have picked the sun-haired woman last to show compassion.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Aviendha nodded, and even managed a smile. “I will beat those men to Rhuidean. They cannot run.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Each Wise One in turn kissed her lightly on each cheek, murmuring, “Come back to us.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Catching Aviendha’s hand, Egwene squeezed it and got a squeeze in return. Then the Aiel woman was running down the mountainside in leaps. It seemed she might well catch up to Rand and Mat. Egwene watched her go worriedly. This was something like being raised to Accepted, it seemed, but without any novice training first, without anyone to give small comfort afterward. What would it have been like to be raised Accepted on her first day in the Tower? She thought she might have gone mad. Nynaeve had been raised so, because of her strength; she thought at least some of Nynaeve’s distaste for Aes Sedai came from what she had experienced then. <span class="calibre18">Come back to us</span>, she thought. <span class="calibre18">Be steadfast.</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">When Aviendha passed out of sight, Egwene sighed and turned back to the Wise Ones. She had her own purpose here, and holding back from it would help no one. “Amys, in <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span> you told me I should come to you to learn. I have.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Haste,” the white-haired woman said. “We have been hasty, because Aviendha struggled so long against her <span class="calibre18">toh</span>, because we feared the Shaido might don veils, even here, if we did not send Rand al’Thor into Rhuidean before they could think.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You believe they’d have tried to kill him?” Egwene said. “But he’s the one you sent people over the Dragonwall to find. He Who Comes With the Dawn.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Bair shifted her shawl. “Perhaps he is. We shall see. If he lives.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He has his mother’s eyes,” Amys said, “and much of her in his face as well as something of his father, but Couladin could see only his clothes, and his horse. The other Shaido would have as well, and perhaps the Taardad, too. Outlanders are not allowed on this ground, and now there are five of you. No, four; Rand al’Thor is no outlander, wherever he was raised. But we have already allowed one to enter Rhuidean, which is also forbidden. Change comes like an avalanche whether we want it or not.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It must come,” Bair said, not sounding happy. “The Pattern plants us where it will.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You knew Rand’s parents?” Egwene asked cautiously. Whatever they said, she still thought of Tam and Kari al’Thor as Rand’s parents.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“That is his story,” Amys said, “if he wants to hear it.” By the firmness of her mouth, she would not say another word on the subject.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Come,” Bair said. “There is no need for haste, now. Come. We offer you water and shade.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene’s knees nearly buckled at the mention of shade. The once-sopping kerchief around her forehead was almost dry; the top of her head felt baked, and the rest of her scarcely less. Moiraine seemed just as grateful to follow the Wise Ones up to one of the small clusters of low, open-sided tents.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">A tall man in sandals and hooded white robes took their horses’ reins. His Aiel face looked odd in the deep soft cowl, with downcast eyes.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Give the animals water,” Bair said before ducking into the low, unwalled tent, and the man bowed to her back, touching his forehead.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene hesitated over letting the man lead Mist away. He seemed confident, but what would an Aiel know of horses? Still, she did not think he would harm them, and it did look wonderfully darker inside the tent. It was, and delightfully cool compared to outside.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The roof of the tent rose to a peak around a hole, but even under that there was barely room to stand. As if to make up for the drab colors the Aiel wore, large gold-tasseled red cushions lay scattered over brightly colored carpets layered thickly enough to pad the hard ground beneath. Egwene and Moiraine imitated the Wise Ones, sinking to the carpet and leaning on one elbow on a cushion. They were all in a circle, nearly close enough to touch the next woman.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Bair struck a small brass gong, and two young women entered with silver trays, bending gracefully, robed in white, with deep cowls and downturned eyes, like the man who had taken the horses. Kneeling in the middle of the tent, one filled a small silver cup with wine for each of the women reclining on a cushion, and the other poured larger cups of water. Without a word, they backed out bowing, leaving the gleaming trays and pitchers, beaded with condensation.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Here is water and shade,” Bair said, lifting her water, “freely given. Let there be no constraints between us. All here are welcome, as first-sisters are welcome.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Let there be no constraints,” Amys and the other two murmured.
After one sip of water, the Aiel women named themselves formally. Bair, of the Haido sept of the Shaarad Aiel. Amys, of the Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel. Melaine, of the Jhirad sept of the Goshien Aiel. Seana, of the Black Cliff sept of the Nakai Aiel.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene and Moiraine followed the ritual, though Moiraine’s mouth tightened when Egwene called herself an Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">As if the sharing of water and names had broken down a wall, the mood in the tent changed palpably. Smiles from the Aiel women, a subtle relaxation, and said formalities were done.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene was more grateful for the water than for the wine. It might be cooler in the tent than outside, but just breathing still dried her throat. At Amys’s gesture she eagerly poured a second cup.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The people in white had been a surprise. It was foolish, but she realized she had been thinking that except for the Wise Ones Aiel were all like Rhuarc and Aviendha, warriors. Of course they had blacksmiths and weavers and other craftsmen; they must. Why not servants? Only, Aviendha had been disdainful of the servants in the Stone, not letting them do anything for her that she could avoid. These people with their humble demeanor did not act like Aiel at all. She did not recall seeing any white in the two large camps. “Is it only Wise Ones who have servants?” she asked.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Melaine choked on her wine. “Servants?” she gasped. “They are <span class="calibre18">gai’shain</span>, not servants.” She sounded as if that should explain everything.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine frowned slightly over her winecup. “<span class="calibre18">Gai’shain?</span> How does that translate?  ‘Those sworn to peace in battle’?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“They are simply <span class="calibre18">gai’shain</span>,” Amys said. She seemed to realize they did not understand. “Forgive me, but do you know of <span class="calibre18">ji’e’toh</span>?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Honor and obligation,” Moiraine replied promptly. “Or perhaps honor and duty.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Those are the words, yes. But the meaning. We live by <span class="calibre18">ji’e’toh</span>, Aes Sedai.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Do not try to tell them all, Amys,” Bair cautioned. “I once spent a month trying to explain <span class="calibre18">ji’e’toh</span> to a wetlander, and at the end she had more questions than at the beginning.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Amys nodded. “I will stay to the core. If you wish it explained, Moiraine.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene would as soon have begun talk of Dreaming, and training, but to her irritation, the Aes Sedai said, “Yes, if you will.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">With a nod to Moiraine, Amys began. “I will follow the line of
<span class="calibre18">gai’shain</span> simply. In the dance of spears, the most <span class="calibre18">ji</span>, honor, is earned by touching an armed enemy without killing, or harming in any way.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The most honor because it is so difficult,” Seana said, bluish gray eyes crinkling wryly, “and thus so seldom done.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The smallest honor comes from killing,” Amys continued. “A child or a fool can kill. In between is the taking of a captive. I pare it down, you see. There are many degrees. <span class="calibre18">Gai’shain</span> are captives taken so, though a warrior who has been touched may sometimes demand to be taken <span class="calibre18">gai’shain</span> to reduce his enemy’s honor and his own loss.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Maidens of the Spear and Stone Dogs especially are known for this,” Seana put in, bringing a sharp look from Amys.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Do I tell this, or do you? To continue. Some may not be taken <span class="calibre18">gai’shain</span>, of course. A Wise One, a blacksmith, a child, a woman with child or one who has a child under the age of ten. A <span class="calibre18">gai’shain</span> has <span class="calibre18">toh</span> to his or her captor. For <span class="calibre18">gai’shain</span>, this is to serve one year and a day, obeying humbly, touching no weapon, doing no violence.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene was interested in spite of herself. “Don’t they try to escape? I certainly would.” <span class="calibre18">I’ll never let anyone make me a prisoner again!</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Wise Ones looked shocked. “It has happened,” Seana said stiffly, “but there is no honor in it. A <span class="calibre18">gai’shain</span> who ran away would be returned by his or her sept to begin the year and a day anew. The loss of honor is so great that a first-brother or first-sister might go as <span class="calibre18">gai’shain</span> as well to discharge the sept’s <span class="calibre18">toh.</span> More than one, if they feel the loss of <span class="calibre18">ji</span> is great.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine seemed to be taking it all in calmly, sipping her water, but it was all Egwene could do not to shake her head. The Aiel were insane; that was all there was to it. It got worse.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Some <span class="calibre18">gai’shain</span> now make an arrogance of humbleness,” Melaine said disapprovingly. “They think they earn honor by it, taking obedience and meekness to the point of mockery. This is a new thing and foolish. It has no part in <span class="calibre18">ji’e’toh.</span>”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Bair laughed, a startling rich sound compared to her reedy voice. “There have always been fools. When I was a girl, and the Shaarad and the Tomanelle were stealing each other’s cattle and goats every night, Chenda, the roofmistress of Mainde Cut, was pushed aside by a young Haido Water Seeker during a raid. She came to Bent Valley and demanded the boy make her <span class="calibre18">gai’shain</span>; she would not allow him to gain the honor of having touched her because <span class="calibre18">she had a carving knife in her hands when he did.</span> A carving knife! It was a weapon, she claimed, as if she were a Maiden. The boy had no choice but to do as she demanded, for all the laughter when he did. One
does not send a roofmistress barefoot back to her hold. Before the year and a day was done, the Haido sept and the Jenda sept exchanged spears, and the boy soon found himself married to Chenda’s eldest daughter. With his second-mother still <span class="calibre18">gai’shain</span> to him. He tried to give her to his wife as part of his bride gift, and both women claimed he was trying to rob them of honor. He nearly had to take his own wife as <span class="calibre18">gai’shain.</span> It came close to raiding between Haido and Jenda again before the <span class="calibre18">toh</span> was discharged.” The Aiel women almost fell over laughing, Amys and Melaine wiping their eyes.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene understood little of the story—certainly not why it was funny—but she managed a polite laugh.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine set her water aside for the small silver cup of wine. “I have heard men speak of fighting the Aiel, but I have never heard of this before. Certainly not of an Aiel surrendering because he was touched.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It is not surrender,” Amys said pointedly. “It is <span class="calibre18">ji’e’toh.</span>”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“No one would ask to be made <span class="calibre18">gai’shain</span> to a wetlander,” Melaine said. “Outlanders do not know of <span class="calibre18">ji’e’toh.</span>”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Aiel women exchanged looks. They were uncomfortable. <span class="calibre18">Why</span>? Egwene wondered. <span class="calibre18">Oh.</span> To the Aiel, not to know <span class="calibre18">ji’e’toh</span> must be like not knowing manners, or not being honorable. “There are honorable men and women among us,” Egwene said. “Most of us. We know right from wrong.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Of course you do,” Bair murmured in a tone that said that was not the same thing at all.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You sent a letter to me in Tear,” Moiraine said, “before I ever reached there. You said a great many things, some of which have proven true. Including that I would—must—meet you here today; you very nearly commanded me to be here. Yet earlier you said <span class="calibre18">if</span> I came. How much of what you wrote did you know to be true?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Amys sighed and set aside her cup of wine, but it was Bair who spoke. “Much is uncertain, even to a dreamwalker. Amys and Melaine are the best of us, and even they do not see all that is, or all that can be.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The present is much clearer than the future even in <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span>,” the sun-haired Wise One said. “What <span class="calibre18">is</span> happening or beginning is more easily seen than what <span class="calibre18">will</span> happen, or <span class="calibre18">may.</span> We did not see Egwene or Mat Cauthon at all. It was no more than an even chance that the young man who calls himself Rand al’Thor would come. If he did not, it was certain that he would die, and the Aiel too. Yet he has come, and if he survives Rhuidean, some of the Aiel at least will survive. This we know. If you had not come, he would have died. If <span class="calibre18">Aan’allein</span> had not come, you would have
died. If you do not go through the rings—” She cut off as if she had bitten her tongue.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene leaned forward intently. Moiraine had to enter Rhuidean? But the Aes Sedai appeared to give no notice, and Seana spoke up quickly to cover Melaine’s slip.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“There is no one set path to the future. The Pattern makes the finest lace look coarse woven sacking, or tangled string. In <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span> it is possible to see some ways the future may be woven. No more than that.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine took a sip of wine. “The Old Tongue is often difficult to translate.” Egwene stared at her. The Old Tongue? What about the rings, the <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal</span>? But Moiraine went blithely on. “<span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span> means the World of Dreams, or perhaps the Unseen World. Neither is really exact; it is more complex than that. <span class="calibre18">Aan’allein.</span> One Man, but also The Man Who Is an Entire People, and two or three other ways to translate it as well. And the words we have taken for common use, and never think of their meanings in the Old Tongue. Warders are called  ‘Gaidin,’ which was  ‘brothers to battle.’ Aes Sedai meant  ‘servant of all.’ And  ‘Aiel.’  ‘Dedicated,’ in the Old Tongue. Stronger than that; it implies an oath written into your bones. I have often wondered what the Aiel are dedicated to.” The Wise Ones’ faces had gone to iron, but Moiraine continued. “And  ‘Jenn Aiel.’  ‘The true dedicated,’ but again stronger. Perhaps  ‘the only true dedicated.’ The only true Aiel?” She looked at them questioningly, just as if they did not suddenly have eyes of stone. None of them spoke.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">What was Moiraine doing? Egwene did not intend to allow the Aes Sedai to ruin her chances of learning whatever the Wise Ones could teach her. “Amys, could we talk of Dreaming now?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Tonight will be time enough,” Amys said.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“But—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Tonight, Egwene. You may be Aes Sedai, but you must become a pupil again. You cannot even go to sleep when you wish yet, or sleep lightly enough to tell what you see before you wake. When the sun begins to set, I will begin to teach you.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Ducking her head, Egwene peered under the edge of the tent roof. From that deep shade, the light outside glared piercingly through heat shimmers in the air; the sun stood no more than halfway to the mountaintops.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Abruptly Moiraine rose to her knees; reaching behind her, she began undoing her dress. “I presume that I must go as Aviendha did,” she said, not as a question.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Bair gave Melaine a hard stare that the younger woman met only for a moment before dropping her eyes. Seana said in a resigned voice, “You should not have been told. It is done, now. Change. One not of the blood has gone to Rhuidean, and now another.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine paused. “Does that make a difference, that I have been told?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Perhaps a great difference,” Bair said reluctantly, “perhaps none. We often guide, but we do not tell. When we saw you go to the rings, each time it was you who brought up going, who demanded the right though you have none of the blood. Now one of us has mentioned it first. Already there are changes from anything we saw. Who can say what they are?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“And what did you see if I do not go?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Bair’s wrinkled face was expressionless, but sympathy touched her pale blue eyes. “We have told too much already, Moiraine. What a dreamwalker sees is what is likely to happen, not what surely will. Those who move with too much knowledge of the future inevitably find disaster, whether from complacency at what they think must come or in their efforts to change it.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It is the mercy of the rings that the memories fade,” Amys said. “A woman knows some things—a few—that will happen; others she will not recognize until the decision is upon her, if then. Life is uncertainty and struggle, choice and change; one who knew how her life was woven into the Pattern as well as she knew how a thread was laid into a carpet would have the life of an animal. If she did not go mad. Humankind is made for uncertainty, struggle, choice and change.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine listened with no outward show of impatience, though Egwene suspected it was there; the Aes Sedai was used to lecturing, not being lectured. She was silent while Egwene helped her out of her dress, not speaking until she crouched naked at the edge of the carpets, peering down the mountainside toward the fog-shrouded city in the valley. Then she said, “Do not let Lan follow me. He will try, if he sees me.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It will be as it will be,” Bair replied. Her thin voice sounded cold and final.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">After a moment, Moiraine gave a grudging nod and slipped out of the tent into the blazing sunlight. She began to run immediately, barefoot down the scorching slope.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene grimaced. Rand and Mat, Aviendha, now Moiraine, all going into Rhuidean. “Will she . . . survive? If you dreamed of this, you must know.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“There are some places one cannot enter in <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span>,” Seana said.
“Rhuidean. Ogier <span class="calibre18">stedding.</span> A few others. What happens there is shielded from a dreamwalker’s eyes.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">That was not an answer—they could have seen whether she came out of Rhuidean—but it was obviously all she was going to get. “Very well. Should I go, too?” She did not relish the thought of experiencing the rings; it would be like being raised to Accepted again. But if everyone else was going . . . .</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Do not be foolish,” Amys said vigorously.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We saw nothing of this for you,” Bair added in a milder tone. “We did not see you at all.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“And I would not say yes if you asked,” Amys went on. “Four are required for permission, and I would say no. You are here to learn to dreamwalk.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“In that case,” Egwene said, settling back on her cushion, “teach me. There must be something you can begin with before tonight.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Melaine frowned at her, but Bair chuckled dryly. “She is as eager and impatient as you were once you decided to learn, Amys.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Amys nodded. “I hope she can keep her eagerness and lose the impatience, for her sake. Hear me, Egwene. Though it will be hard, you must forget that you are Aes Sedai if you are to learn. You must listen, remember, and do as you are told. Above all, you must not enter <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span> again until one of us says you may. Can you accept this?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">It would not be hard to forget she was Aes Sedai when she was not. For the rest, it sounded ominously like becoming a novice again. “I can accept it.” She hoped she did not sound doubtful.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Good,” Bair said. “I will now tell you about dreamwalking and <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span>, in a very general way. When I am done, you will repeat back to me what I have said. If you fail to touch all points, you will scrub the pots in place of the <span class="calibre18">gai’shain</span> tonight. If your memory is so poor that you cannot repeat what I say after a second hearing . . . . Well, we will discuss that when it happens. Attend.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Almost anyone can touch <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span>, but few can truly enter it. Of all the Wise Ones, we four alone can dreamwalk, and your Tower has not produced a dreamwalker in nearly five hundred years. It is not a thing of the One Power, though Aes Sedai believe it is. I cannot channel, nor can Seana, yet we dreamwalk as well as Amys or Melaine. Many people brush the World of Dreams in their sleep. Because they only brush against it, they wake with aches or pains where they should have broken bones or
mortal hurts. A dreamwalker enters the dream fully, therefore her injuries are real on waking. For one who is fully in the dream, dreamwalker or not, death there is death here. To enter the dream too completely, though, is to lose touch with the flesh; there is no way back, and the flesh dies. It is said that once there were those who could enter the dream in the flesh, and no longer be in this world at all. This was an evil thing, for they did evil; it must never be attempted, even if you believe it possible for you, for each time you will lose some part of what makes you human. You must learn to enter <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span> when you wish, to the degree you wish. You must learn to find what you need to find and read what you see, to enter the dreams of another close by in order to aid healing, to recognize those who are in the dream fully enough to harm you, to . . . .”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene listened intently. It fascinated her, hinting at things she had never suspected were possible, but beyond that she had no intention of ending up scrubbing pots. It did not seem fair, somehow. Whatever Rand and Mat and the others faced in Rhuidean, they were not going to be sent off to scrub pots. <span class="calibre18">And I</span> agreed <span class="calibre18">to it!</span> It just was not fair. But then, she doubted they could get any more out of Rhuidean than she would from these women.</span></div>
