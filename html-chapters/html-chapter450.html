<p class="para1"><strong class="calibre14">A Note on Dates in This Glossary.</strong> The Toman Calendar (devised by Toma dur Ahmid) was adopted approximately two centuries after the death of the last male Aes Sedai, recording years After the Breaking of the World (AB). So many records were destroyed in the Trolloc Wars that at their end there was argument about the exact year under the old system. A new calendar, proposed by Tiam of Gazar, celebrated freedom from the Trolloc threat and recorded each year as a Free Year (FY). The Gazaran Calendar gained wide acceptance within twenty years after the Wars’ end. Artur Hawkwing attempted to establish a new calendar based on the founding of his empire (FF, From the Founding), but only historians now refer to it. After the death and destruction of the War of the Hundred Years, a third calendar was devised by Uren din Jubai Soaring Gull, a scholar of the Sea Folk, and promulgated by the Panarch Farede of Tarabon. The Farede Calendar, dating from the arbitrarily decided end of the War of the Hundred Years and recording years of the New Era (NE), is currently in use.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">a’dam</em></strong> (AYE-dam): A device for controlling a woman who can channel, usable only by either a woman who can channel or a woman who can be taught to channel, and having no effect on any woman who cannot channel. It creates a link between the two women. The Seanchan version <a id="page_670" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>consists of a collar and bracelet connected by a leash, all of silvery metal, but one example of a version without the leash has been made, and another, unique, variant is believed to exist which allows a woman to control a man who can channel. If such a man is linked by an ordinary <em class="calibre4">a’dam</em> to a woman who can channel, the likely result is death for both. When an <em class="calibre4">a’dam</em> is worn by a woman who can channel, simply touching the <em class="calibre4">a’dam</em> results in pain for a man who also can. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> linking, Seanchan.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Age of Legends:</strong> Age ended by the War of the Shadow and the Breaking of the World. A time when Aes Sedai performed wonders now only dreamed of.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Aiel War (976–78 NE):</strong> When King Laman (LAY-mahn) of Cairhien cut down <em class="calibre4">Avendoraldera</em>, four clans of the Aiel crossed the Spine of the World. They looted and burned the capital city of Cairhien as well as many other cities and towns, and the conflict extended into Andor and Tear. By the conventional view, the Aiel were finally defeated at the Battle of the Shining Walls, before Tar Valon; in fact, Laman was killed in that battle, and having done what they came for, the Aiel recrossed the Spine. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Cairhien; Spine of the World.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Ajah</strong> (AH-jah): Societies among the Aes Sedai, seven in number and designated by colors: Blue, Red, White, Green, Brown, Yellow and Gray. All Aes Sedai except the Amyrlin Seat belong to one. Each follows a specific philosophy of the use of the One Power and the purposes of the Aes Sedai. The Red Ajah bends its energies to finding men who can channel, and to gentling them. The Brown forsakes the mundane world and dedicates itself to seeking knowledge, while the White, largely eschewing both the world and the value of worldly knowledge, devotes itself to questions of philosophy and truth. The Green Ajah (called the Battle Ajah during the Trolloc Wars) holds itself ready for Tarmon Gai’don, the Yellow concentrates on the study of Healing, and Blue sisters involve themselves with causes and justice. The Gray are mediators, seeking harmony and consensus. A Black Ajah, dedicated to serving the Dark One, is officially and vehemently denied.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">algai’d’siswai</em></strong>: In the Old Tongue, “fighters of the spear,” or “spear fighters.” The name given to those Aiel who carry the spear and regularly take part in battle as opposed to those who follow crafts.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Altara</strong> (al-TAH-rah): A nation on the Sea of Storms, though in truth little unifies it except a name. The people of Altara think of themselves as inhabitants of a town or village, or as this lord’s or that lady’s people, <a id="page_671" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>first, and only second if at all as Altaran. Few nobles pay taxes to the crown or offer more than lip service, and that often slight. The ruler of Altara (currently Queen Tylin Quintara of House Mitsobar; TIE-lihn quin-TAHR-ah; MIHT-soh-bahr) is seldom more than the most powerful noble in the land, and at times has not even really been that. The Throne of the Winds holds so little power that many powerful nobles have scorned to take it when they could have. The banner of Altara is two golden leopards on a field checked four-by-four in red and blue. The sigil of House Mitsobar is a green anchor and sword, crossed. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Wise Woman.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Amys</strong> (ah-MEESE): Wise One of Cold Rocks Hold, and a dreamwalker. An Aiel of the Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel. Wife of Rhuarc (ROARK), sister-wife to Lian (lee-AHN), who is roofmistress of Cold Rocks Hold. Amys is sister-mother to Aviendha.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">angreal</em></strong> (ahn-gree-AHL): Remnants of the Age of Legends that allow anyone capable of channeling to handle a greater amount of the Power than is safe or even possible unaided. Some were made for use by women, others by men. Rumors of <em class="calibre4">angreal</em> usable by both men and women have never been confirmed. Their making is no longer known, and few are known to remain in existence. <em class="calibre4">See also sa’angreal; ter’angreal.</em></p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Asha’man</strong> (AH-shah-mahn): (1) In the Old Tongue, “Guardian” or “Defender,” with a strong implication that this is a defender of truth and justice. (2) The name taken by followers of the Dragon Reborn, men who have come to what is now being called the Black Tower in order to learn how to channel. Some have dreamed of channeling despite all the dire risks, while others remain only because passing the test for the ability to learn has itself started them on the road to channeling, and they now must learn to control it before it kills them. They train not only in using the One Power, but in the use of the sword and in fighting with hands and feet. The Asha’man, who wear distinctive black coats, are divided according to the level of knowledge they have achieved, the lowest being a Soldier. The next level is a Dedicated, marked by a pin in the shape of a silver sword worn on the coat collar. The highest level is called simply an Asha’man, marked by a red-and-gold enameled pin in the shape of a Dragon worn on the coat collar opposite the silver sword. Unlike Aes Sedai, who go to great lengths to make sure that those they train are not allowed to move dangerously fast, the Asha’man are pushed hard from the beginning, most especially in learning to use the Power as a weapon. As a result, where the <a id="page_672" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>death or stilling of a novice of the White Tower during her training would be something spoken of with horror for years, at the Black Tower it is expected that a certain number of Asha’man Soldiers will die or be burned out attempting to learn. The existence of the Asha’man, and their connection to the Dragon Reborn, has caused a reevaluation among some Aes Sedai of the immediate necessity for gentling, but many have not changed their view at all. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> gentling, stilling.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Asunawa, Rhadam</strong> (ah-soo-NAH-wah, RAH-dam): High Inquisitor of the Hand of the Light. In his eyes, meddling with the One Power is usurping the Creator’s power and is the cause of all the world’s ills. He wants more than anything else to destroy anyone and everyone who can channel or even wishes to; they must confess their sin under the ministrations of the Hand of the Light, and then die. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Questioners.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Atha’an Miere</strong> (ah-thah-AHN mee-EHR): See Sea Folk.</p>
<p class="para1"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Band of the Red Hand:</strong> (1) A legendary band of heroes <em class="calibre4">(Shen an Calhar)</em> from the Trolloc Wars who died at the Battle of Aemon’s Field, when Manetheren fell. (2) A military formation which gathered to follow Mat Cauthon, and which is currently shadowing the rebel Aes Sedai and their army with orders to carry Egwene al’Vere to Rand al’Thor and safety, should she express a wish to flee from her current situation, and also any other sisters who might wish to join her.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Berelain sur Paendrag</strong> (BEH-reh-lain suhr PAY-ehn-DRAG): First of Mayene, Blessed of the Light, Defender of the Waves, High Seat of House Paeron (pay-eh-ROHN). A beautiful and willful young woman, and a skillful ruler. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Mayene.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Birgitte</strong> (ber-GEET-teh): Warder to Elayne Trakand, believed to be possibly the first female Warder ever, a fact that causes a number of difficulties, few of them expected. Birgitte is in truth the legendary hero of that name, who was one of those bound to be called back by the Horn of Valere, but she was ripped out of <em class="calibre4">Tel’aran’rhiod</em> into the world of the flesh during a struggle with Moghedien and was only saved from death by being bonded by Elayne. Except for her beauty and skill with a bow, she is little like the stories of her. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Forsaken; Horn of Valere; Warder.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Bryne, Gareth</strong> (BRIHN, GAH-rehth): Once Captain-General of the Queen’s Guards in Andor, now commanding an army for those Aes Sedai in rebellion against the authority of Elaida do Avriny a’Roihan. <a id="page_673" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>Considered one of the greatest generals living. His relationship with Siuan Sanche troubles him nearly as much as it does her. The sigil of House Bryne is a wild bull, the rose crown of Andor around its neck. Gareth Bryne’s personal sigil is three golden stars, each of five rays.</p>
<p class="para1"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">cadin’sor</em></strong> <em class="calibre4">(KAH-dihn-sohr):</em> Garb of Aiel <em class="calibre4">algai’d’siswai:</em> coat and breeches in browns and grays that fade into rock or shadow, along with soft, laced knee-high boots. In the Old Tongue, “working clothes,” though this is of course an imprecise translation. <em class="calibre4">See also algai’d’siswai.</em></p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Cadsuane Melaidhrin</strong> (CAD-soo-ain meh-LIE-drihn): An Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah who has approached legendary status among Aes Sedai while still alive, though in truth most sisters believe she must be years dead by now. Thought to have been born around 705 NE in Ghealdan, which would make her the oldest living Aes Sedai, she was also the strongest in the Power found for a thousand years or more until the advent of Nynaeve, Elayne and Egwene and even they do not far out-step her. Although a Green, over the years she has confronted and captured more men who could channel by far than any other living sister; a little-known oddity is that the men she brought to the White Tower tended to live markedly longer after being gentled than those brought by other sisters.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Cairhien</strong> (KEYE-ree-EHN): Both a nation along the Spine of the World and the capital city of that nation. Savaged during the Aiel War, the nation of Cairhien was in no way fully recovered when the assassination of King Galldrian (998 NE) plunged the country into a war for the succession which was itself interrupted by the invasion of the Shaido Aiel in what many call the Second Aiel War, although the city itself was saved by Aiel intervention under Rand al’Thor. Subsequently most nobles of Cairhien, along with many from Tear, swore fealty to the Dragon Reborn, but in a land where the Game of Houses has been raised to an art, it is hardly surprising that even many who swore are ready to maneuver for whatever advantage they can find. The banner of Cairhien is a many-rayed golden sun rising on a field of sky blue. <strong class="calibre14">calendar:</strong> There are 10 days to the week, 28 days to the month and 13 months to the year. Several feastdays are not part of any month; these include Sunday (the longest day of the year), the Feast of Thanksgiving (once every four years at the spring equinox), and the Feast of All Souls Salvation, also called All Souls Day (once every ten years at the autumn equinox). While many feasts and festivals are celebrated everywhere <a id="page_674" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>(such as the Feast of the Lights, which ends the old year and begins the new), every land has its own as well, and in many instances so do individual towns and villages. In general, the Borderlands have the fewest festivals and feastdays, while the cities of Illian and Ebou Dar have the most.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Caraighan Maconar</strong> (kah-RYE-gihn mah-CON-ahr): Legendary Green sister (212 AB–373 AB), the heroine of a hundred adventures, credited with exploits that even some Aes Sedai consider improbable despite their inclusion in the records of the White Tower, such as single-handedly putting down a rebellion in Mosadorin and quelling the Comaidin Riots at a time when she had no Warders. Considered by the Green Ajah to be the archetype of a Green sister. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Ajah.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Children of the Light:</strong> Society of strict ascetic beliefs, owing allegiance to no nation and dedicated to the defeat of the Dark One and the destruction of all Darkfriends. Founded during the War of the Hundred Years to proselytize against an increase in Darkfriends, they evolved during the war into a completely military society. Extremely rigid in beliefs, and certain that only they know the truth and the right. Consider Aes Sedai and any who support them to be Darkfriends. Known disparagingly as Whitecloaks. Their sign is a golden sunburst on a field of white. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Questioners.</p>
<p class="para1"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Darkfriends:</strong> Adherents of the Dark One. They believe they will gain great power and rewards, even immortality, when he is freed. Secretive of necessity, they organize into groups called “circles,” with members of one circle rarely if ever known to members of another. Rank in the outside world has no bearing on rank with the circles; a king or queen who was a Darkfriend would be expected to obey a beggar who gave the proper signs. Among themselves, they sometimes use the ancient name Friends of the Dark.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Dragonsworn:</strong> General term used for supporters of the Dragon Reborn, usually by those who either oppose him or at least think to remain neutral. In fact, many given that name have never sworn any sort of oath, and it is frequently applied to brigands as well, some of whom claim the name in the hope that it will quell resistance. A great many atrocities have been committed by people claiming to be Dragonsworn.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Ebou Dar:</strong> The capital city of Altara. One of the great ports, and a city with many odd customs for an outsider to assimilate. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Altara.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><a id="page_675" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14">Elaida do Avriny a’Roihan</strong> (eh-LY-da doh AHV-rih-nee ah-ROY-han):  An Aes Sedai, formerly of the Red Ajah, now raised to the Amyrlin Seat, though opposed by another claiming that title. Once advisor to Queen Morgase of Andor. She sometimes has the Foretelling.</p>
<p class="para1"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Flame of Tar Valon:</strong> Symbol of Tar Valon, the Amyrlin Seat, and the Aes Sedai. A stylized representation of a flame; a white teardrop, point upward.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Forsaken, the:</strong> Name given to thirteen of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends, thus among the most powerful ever known, who went over to the Dark One during the War of the Shadow in return for the promise of immortality and were imprisoned along with the Dark One when his prison was resealed. Their own name for themselves was “the Chosen.” The names given to them are still used to frighten children. They were: Aginor (AGH-ih-nohr), Asmodean (ahs-MOH-dee-an), Balthamel (BAAL-thah-mell), Be’lal (BEH-lahl), Demandred (DEE-man-drehd), Graendal (GREHN-dahl), Ishamael (ih-SHAH-may-EHL), Lanfear (LAN-feer), Mesaana (meh-SAH-nah), Moghedien (moh-GHEH-dee-ehn), Rahvin (RAAV-ihn), Sammael (SAHM-may-EHL), and Semirhage (SEH-mih-RHAHG). It is believed by those with some current knowledge that only Demandred and Sammael survive among the men, and only Graendal, Mesaana, Moghedien and Semirhage among the women. A number of strange encounters, however, suggest the possibility either that several new Chosen have been selected by the Dark One or that Lord of the Grave has in some cases reached beyond death.</p>
<p class="para1"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Gaidin</strong> (GYE-deen): In the Old Tongue, “Brother to Battles.” A title used by Aes Sedai for the Warders. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Warder.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">gai’shain</em></strong> (GYE-shain): In the Old Tongue, “Pledged to Peace in Battle” is as close a translation as is possible. An Aiel taken prisoner by other Aiel during raid or battle is required by <em class="calibre4">ji’e’toh</em> to serve his or her captor humbly and obediently for one year and a day, touching no weapon and doing no violence. A Wise One, a blacksmith, a child, or a woman with a child under the age of ten may not be made <em class="calibre4">gai’shain.</em> Since the revelation that the ancestors of the Aiel were in fact pacifist followers of the Way of the Leaf, a good many <em class="calibre4">gai’shain</em> refuse to put off white when their time ends. Additionally, although by tradition as strong as <a id="page_676" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>law no one who does not follow <em class="calibre4">ji’e’toh</em> can be made <em class="calibre4">gai’shain</em>, the Shaido Aiel have begun putting Cairhienin and other prisoners into <em class="calibre4">gai’shain</em> robes, and many have come to believe that since these people do not follow <em class="calibre4">ji’e’toh</em>, there is no need to release them at the end of the year and a day.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Gawyn</strong> (GAH-wihn) <strong class="calibre14">of House Trakand</strong> (trah-KAND): Queen Morgase’s son, and Elayne’s brother, who will be First Prince of the Sword when Elayne ascends to the throne. Half-brother to Galad Damodred. A man caught in more than one cleft stick; he depises Aes Sedai yet has sworn to serve them, and he hates Rand al’Thor yet has sworn not to raise a hand against him, all because he loves Egwene al’Vere beyond reason. He does not know that Egwene herself has not only become Aes Sedai, but the Amyrlin Seat opposing the Amyrlin he recognizes. His sign is a white boar.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">gentling:</strong> The removal of a man’s ability to channel. Considered necessary by most people because any man who channels will go insane from the taint on <em class="calibre4">saidin</em> and almost certainly commit atrocities with the Power in his madness before the taint kills him. One who has been gentled can still sense the True Source, but cannot touch it. Whatever madness has come before gentling is arrested but not cured, and if it is done soon enough, the rotting death brought by the taint can be averted. A man who is gentled, however, inevitably stops wanting to live; those who do not succeed in committing suicide usually die anyway within a year or two. Once believed permanent, gentling is now known by some to be susceptible to a highly specialized form of Healing. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> stilling.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Great Lord of the Dark:</strong> Name by which Darkfriends refer to the Dark One, claiming that to speak his true name would be blasphemous.</p>
<p class="para1"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Hall of the Tower, the:</strong> The legislative body of the Aes Sedai, traditionally consisting of three Sitters in the Hall from each of the seven Ajahs. At present, there is a Hall sitting in the White Tower, which contains no Sitters for the Blue, and a Hall among those Aes Sedai who oppose Elaida do Avriny a’Roihan. This rebel Hall contains no Red Sitters. While the Amyrlin Seat is by law the absolute power in the White Tower, in fact her power has always depended on how well she could lead, manage or intimidate the Hall, as there are many ways that the Hall can balk any Amyrlin’s plans. There are two levels of agreement that may be required for items to pass the Hall, the lesser consensus <a id="page_677" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>and the greater consensus. The greater consensus requires that every sister who is present must stand, and that a minimum of eleven Sitters be present; the presence of at least one Sitter from each Ajah is also required, except when the matter before the Hall is the removal of an Amyrlin or Keeper, in which case the Ajah from which she was raised will not be informed of the vote until after it has been taken. The lesser consensus also requires a quorum of eleven Sitters, but only two-thirds of those present need stand for an item to pass. Another difference is that there is no requirement for all Ajahs to be represented in the lesser consensus except in the case of a declaration of war by the White Tower, one of several matters left to the lesser consensus which many might think would require the greater. The Amyrlin Seat may call for any Sitter to resign her chair, or indeed for all to, and that call must be heeded. This is seldom done, however, as nothing stops an Ajah from returning the same Sitter or Sitters except a custom that sisters not serve again in the Hall after leaving it. As an indication of how serious such a call for a mass resignation would be, it is reliably believed that it has happened exactly four times in the more than three-thousand-year history of the White Tower, and that while two of those resulted in the selection of an entirely, or nearly, new Hall, the other two resulted in the resignation and exile of the Amyrlin involved.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Horn of Valere</strong> (vah-LEER): The legendary object of the Great Hunt of the Horn, it can call back dead heroes from the grave to fight against the Shadow. A new Hunt of the Horn has been called, and sworn Hunters for the Horn can now be found in many nations. Few even among Aes Sedai know that the Horn has actually been found and used, or that it is now hidden in the White Tower.</p>
<p class="para1"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Illian</strong> (IHL-lee-an): A great port on the Sea of Storms, capital city of the nation of the same name. An ancient enemy of Tear. The banner of Illian is nine golden bees on a field of green.</p>
<p class="para1"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Juilin Sandar</strong> (JUY-lihn sahn-DAHR): A thief-catcher from Tear. A man in love with perhaps the very last woman he would ever have thought he could be.</p>
<p class="para1"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">length, units of:</strong> 10 inches = 1 foot; 3 feet = 1 pace; 2 paces = 1 span; 1000 spans = 1 mile; 4 miles = 1 league.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><a id="page_678" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14">Lini</strong> (LIHN-nee): Childhood nurse to the Lady Elayne, and before her to Elayne’s mother, Morgase, as well as to Morgase’s mother. A woman of vast inner strength, considerable perception, and a great many sayings, who has never quite admitted that any of her charges has grown up completely.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">linking:</strong> The ability of women who can channel to combine their flows of the One Power. While the combined flow is not as great as the sum total of the individual flows, it is directed by the person who leads the link and can be used much more precisely and to far greater effect than the individual flows could be. Men cannot link their abilities without the presence of a woman or women in the circle. Entering a link is normally a voluntary act, requiring at least acquiesence, but under certain circumstances, a sufficient circle already formed can bring another woman forcibly into the circle as long as no man is part of it. Insofar as is known, a man cannot be forced into a circle, no matter how large. Up to thirteen women can link without the presence of a man. With the addition of one man, the circle can increase to twenty-six women. Two men can take the circle to include forty-three women, and so on until the limit of six men and sixty-six women is reached. There are links that include more men and fewer women, but except in the linking of one man and one woman, two men and one woman or two men and two women, there must always be at least one more woman in the circle than there are men. In most circles, either a man or a woman can control the link, but a man must control in the circle of seventy-two as well as in mixed circles of fewer than thirteen but more than four. Although men are in general stronger in the Power than women, the strongest circles are those which contain as near as possible to equal numbers of men and women.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Logain Ablar</strong> (loh-GAIN): Born 972 NE in Ghealdan, once claimed to be the Dragon Reborn. Captured after carrying war across Ghealdan, Altara and Murandy, he was taken to the White Tower and gentled, later escaping in the confusion after Siuan Sanche was deposed. The accidental restoration of his ability to channel was the first indication that such a loss was not permanent. Confined after his Healing, he escaped again, and his present whereabouts are unknown. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> gentling; stilling.</p>
<p class="para1"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Mayene</strong> (may-EHN): City-state on the Sea of Storms, hemmed in and historically oppressed by Tear. The ruler of Mayene is styled the First, which title was once the First Lord or Lady; Firsts claim to be descendants <a id="page_679" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>of Artur Hawkwing. The banner of Mayene is a golden hawk in flight on a field of blue.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Mazrim Taim</strong> (MAHZ-rihm tah-EEM): A man who raised havoc in Saldaea until he was defeated and captured, although he later escaped, apparently with the aid of some of his followers. Not only able to channel, but of great strength, he is now the M’Hael (MA’kHAIL; “leader,” in the Old Tongue) of the Asha’man. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Asha’man.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Melaine</strong> (meh-LAYN): A Wise One of the Jhirad sept of Goshien Aiel. A dreamwalker. Moderately strong in the One Power. Married to Bael (BAYL), clan chief of the Goshien. Sister-wife to Dorindha (dohr-IHN-dah), roofmistress of Smoke Springs Hold.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Moiraine Damodred</strong> (mwah-RAIN DAHM-oh-drehd): An Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah, born into the then-reigning House of Cairhien, who vanished into a <em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em> in Cairhien while battling Lanfear, apparently killing both herself and the Forsaken. Since she had already located the Dragon Reborn and killed the Forsaken Be’lal, she is already looked upon as one of those near-mythical sisters who are held as legendary heroes. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Forsaken.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Morgase</strong> (moor-GAYZ): By the Grace of the Light, Queen of Andor, Defender of the Realm, Protector of the People, High Seat of House Trakand. Now in exile and believed dead, murdered by the Dragon Reborn, or so many think. Her sign is three golden keys. The sign of House Trakand is a silver keystone.</p>
<p class="para1"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">near-sister; near-brother:</strong> Aiel kinship terms meaning friends as close as first-sisters or first-brothers. Near-sisters often adopt one another formally as first-sisters in an elaborate ceremony carried out before Wise Ones, after which they are recognized by other Aiel as truly born twins, though a pair of twins with two mothers. Near-brothers almost never do this.</p>
<p class="para1"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Oaths, Three:</strong> The oaths taken by an Accepted on being raised to Aes Sedai. Spoken while holding the Oath Rod, a <em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em> that makes oaths binding. They are: (1) To speak no word that is not true. (2) To make no weapon with which one man may kill another. (3) Never to use the One Power as a weapon except against Darkfriends or Shadowspawn, or in the last extreme of defense of her own life, or that of her Warder or another Aes Sedai. The second oath was the first adopted after the War of the Shadow. The first oath, while held to the letter, is often circumvented by careful speaking. It is believed that the last two are inviolable.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><a id="page_680" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14">Old Tongue:</strong> The language spoken during the Age of Legends. It is generally expected that nobles and the educated can speak it, but most actually know only a few words. Translation is often difficult, as it is a language capable of many subtly different meanings. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Age of Legends.</p>
<p class="para1"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Padan Fain</strong> (PAD-an FAIN): Once a peddler trading into the Two Rivers, and a Darkfriend, he was transformed at Shayol Ghul, not only to enable him to find the young man who would become the Dragon Reborn as a hound finds prey for the hunter, but to ingrain the need to find him. The pain of this transformation induced in Fain a hatred both of the Dark One and of Rand al’Thor. While following al’Thor, he encountered the trapped soul of Mordeth in Shadar Logoth, and this soul tried to take Fain’s body. Because of what had been made of Fain, though, the result was an amalgamation that was mostly Fain and that has abilities beyond what either man had originally, though Fain does not understand them fully yet. Most men feel fear at a Myrddraal’s eyeless gaze; Myrddraal feel fear at Fain’s gaze.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Prophet, the:</strong> More elaborately, the Prophet of the Lord Dragon. Title claimed by Masema Dagar, a onetime Shienaran soldier, who preaches the rebirth of the Dragon Reborn. He has achieved a great following in Ghealdan and northern Amadicia, in part because of spreading knowledge that the Dragon has indeed been Reborn and in part because of the extreme brutality his followers visit not only on anyone who refuses to acknowledge the Dragon Reborn, but on those who refuse to acknowledge the authority of the Prophet as the hand and voice of the Dragon Reborn.</p>
<p class="para1"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Questioners, the:</strong> An order within the Children of the Light. Avowed purposes are to discover the truth in disputations and uncover Darkfriends. In the search for truth and the Light, their normal method of inquiry is torture; their normal manner that they know the truth already and must only make their victim confess to it. They refer to themselves as the Hand of the Light, the Hand that digs out truth, and at times act as if they were entirely separate from the Children and the Council of the Anointed, which commands the Children. The head of the Questioners is the High Inquisitor, who sits on the Council of the Anointed. Their sign is a blood-red shepherd’s crook. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Children of the Light.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><a id="page_681" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14">Rhuidean</strong> (RHUY-dee-ahn): A great city, the only one in the Aiel Waste and totally unknown to the outside world. Abandoned for nearly three thousand years. Once men among the Aiel were allowed to enter Rhuidean only once, in order to be tested inside a great <em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em> for fitness to become clan chief (only one in three survived), and women only twice, for testing to become Wise Ones, the second time in the same <em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em>, though with a considerably higher survival rate than the men. Now the city is inhabited again, by Aiel, and a great lake occupies one end of the valley of Rhuidean, fed by an underground ocean of fresh water and in turn feeding the only river in the Waste.</p>
<p class="para1"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">sa’angreal</em></strong> (SAH-ahn-GREE-ahl): Remnants of the Age of Legends that allow channeling much more of the One Power than is otherwise possible or safe. A <em class="calibre4">sa’angreal</em> is similar to, but more powerful than, an <em class="calibre4">angreal.</em> The amount of the Power that can be wielded with a <em class="calibre4">sa’angreal</em> compares to the amount that can be handled with an <em class="calibre4">angreal</em> as the Power wielded with the aid of an <em class="calibre4">angreal</em> does to the amount that can be handled unaided. The making of them is no longer known. As with <em class="calibre4">angreal</em>, there are male and female <em class="calibre4">sa’angreal.</em> Only a handful remain, far fewer even than <em class="calibre4">angreal</em>.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Sea Folk, the:</strong> More properly, the Atha’an Miere (AH-thah-AHN MEE-air), the People of the Sea. They live most of their lives on their ships and strongly dislike going any distance from the ocean. Relatively little is known of their customs, giving rise to an air of exotic mystery and often to fanciful tales. Most seaborne trade is carried by Sea Folk ships, which include the fastest by far and most of the largest, and they are considered by the inhabitants of port cities to be bargainers who outstrip the more widely known Domani. As survival at sea often depends on instant obedience, it should be no surprise that the Atha’an Miere stick strictly to their hierarchy, though there are surprising fluidities at some points. The Atha’an Miere are divided into numerous clans, both large and small, each headed by a Wavemistress. Below her are the Sailmistresses, the ships’ captains of the clan. A Wavemistress has vast authority, yet she is elected to that position by the twelve senior clan Sailmistresses, who are referred to as the First Twelve of that clan, and she can be removed by the order of the Mistress of the Ships to the Atha’an Miere. The Mistress of the Ships has a level of authority any shorebound king or queen would envy, yet she also is elected, for life, by unanimous vote of the twelve senior Wavemistresses, who are <a id="page_682" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>called the First Twelve of the Atha’an Miere. (The term “the First Twelve” is also used for the twelve senior Wavemistresses or Sailmistresses present in any gathering.) The position of Master of the Blades is held by a man who may or may not be the husband of the Mistress of the Ships. His responsibilities are the defense and the trade of the Sea Folk, and below him are the Swordmasters of Wavemistresses and the Cargomasters of Sailmistresses, who hold like positions and duties; for each of them, any authority outside these areas is held only as delegated by the woman he serves. Where any vessel sails and when is always up to the Sailmistress, but since trade and finances are totally in the hands of the Cargomaster (or, at higher levels, of the Swordmaster or the Master of the Blades), a close degree of cooperation is required. Every Sea Folk vessel, however small, and also every Wavemistress, has a Windfinder, a woman who is almost always able to channel and skilled in Weaving the Winds, as the Atha’an Miere call the manipulation of weather. The Windfinder to the Mistress of the Ships has authority over the Windfinders to the Wavemistresses, who in turn have authority over Windfinders to the Sailmistresses of their clans. One peculiarity of the Sea Folk is that all must begin at the very lowest rank and work their way up, and that anyone other than the Mistress of the Ships can be demoted by those above, even to the very bottom again in extreme instances.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Seanchan</strong> (SHAWN-CHAN): (1) Descendants of the armies Artur Hawkwing sent across the Aryth Ocean, who conquered the lands there. They believe that any woman who can channel must be controlled for the safety of everyone else, and any man who can channel must be killed for the same reason. (2) The land from which the Seanchan come.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Shayol Ghul</strong> (SHAY-ol GHOOL): A mountain in the Blasted Lands, beyond the Great Blight. Site of the Dark One’s prison.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">sister-wife:</strong> Aiel kinship term. Aiel women who are near-sisters or first-sisters, and who discover they love the same man or simply do not want a man to come between them, will both marry him, thus becoming sister-wives. Women who love the same man will sometimes try to find out whether they can become near-sisters and adopted first-sisters, a first step to becoming sister-wives. An Aiel man faced with this situation has the choice of marrying both women or neither; if he has a wife who decides to take a sister-wife, he finds himself with a second wife.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><a id="page_683" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">siswai’aman</em></strong>: In the Old Tongue: “spears of the dragon,” with a strong implication of ownership. The name taken by a good many men among the Aiel, but no women. These men do not actually acknowledge the name—nor do any others, in fact—but they wear a strip of red cloth wound around the forehead with a disc, half black and half white, above the brows. Although <em class="calibre4">gai’shain</em> normally are prohibited from wearing anything that would be worn by an <em class="calibre4">algai’d’siswai</em>, a large number of <em class="calibre4">gai’shain</em> have taken to wearing the headband. <em class="calibre4">See also gai’shain.</em></p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Sorilea</strong> (soh-rih-LEE-ah): The Wise One of Shende Hold, a Jarra Chareen. Barely able to channel, she is also the oldest living Wise One, though not by as much as many think.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Spine of the World:</strong> A towering mountain range, with few passes, which separates the Aiel Waste from the lands to the west. Also called the Dragonwall.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">stilling:</strong> The removal of a woman’s ability to channel. A woman who has been stilled can sense but not touch the True Source. Officially, stilling is the result of trial and sentence for a crime, and was last carried out in 859 NE. Novices have always been required to learn the name and crimes of all women who have suffered judicial stilling. When the ability to channel is lost accidentally, it is called being burned out, though “stilling” is often used for that also. Women who are stilled, however it occurs, seldom survive long; they seem to simply give up and die unless they find something to replace the emptiness left by the One Power. While it has always been believed that stilling was permanent, lately a method of Healing it has been discovered, though there appear to be limits to this which are yet to be explored.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Stone of Tear:</strong> A great fortress in the city of Tear, said to have been made with the One Power soon after the Breaking of the World. Attacked and besieged unsuccessfully countless times, it fell in a single night to the Dragon Reborn and a few hundred Aiel, thus fulfilling two parts of the Prophecies of the Dragon.</p>
<p class="para1"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Talents:</strong> Abilities in the use of the One Power in specific areas. Aptitude in various Talents varies widely from individual to individual and is seldom related to the strength of the individual’s ability to channel. There are major Talents, the best-known and most widespread of which is Healing. Other examples are Cloud Dancing, the control of weather, and Earth Singing, which involves controlling movements of the earth, for example preventing, or causing, earthquakes or avalanches. There <a id="page_684" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>are also minor Talents, seldom given a name, such as the ability to see <em class="calibre4">ta’veren</em> or to duplicate the chance-twisting effect of <em class="calibre4">ta’veren</em>, though in a very small and localized area rarely covering more than a few square feet. Many Talents are now known only by their names and sometimes vague descriptions. Some, such as Traveling (the ability to shift from one place to another without crossing the intervening space) are only now being rediscovered. Others, such as Foretelling (the ability to foretell future events, but in a general way), and Delving (the location of ores and possibly their removal from the ground, although the term is now also used for the variant of Healing which is used to examine someone’s health and physical condition) are found rarely. Another Talent long thought lost is Dreaming, interpreting the Dreamer’s dreams to foretell future events in more specific fashion than Foretelling. Some Dreamers had the ability to enter <em class="calibre4">Tel’aran’rhiod</em>, the World of Dreams, and (it is said) even other people’s dreams. The last acknowledged Dreamer previously was Corianin Nedeal (coh-ree-AHN-ihn neh-dee-AHL), who died in 526 NE, but there is now another.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Tallanvor, Martyn</strong> (TAL-lahn-vohr, mahr-TEEN): Former Guardsman-Lieutenant of the Queen’s Guards, who loves Morgase more than life or honor. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Morgase.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">ta’veren</em></strong> (tah-VEER-ehn): A person around whom the Wheel of Time weaves all surrounding life-threads, perhaps ALL life-threads. This weaving is little understood except that it seems in many ways an alteration of chance; what might happen, but only rarely, does. The effect can at times be quite localized. Someone influenced by a <em class="calibre4">ta’veren</em> may say or do what they would only have said or done one time in a million under those circumstances. Events occur of seeming impossibility, such as a child falling a hundred feet from a tower unharmed. At other times the effect seems to extend to influencing history itself, though often by means of the localized effects. This, it is believed, is the real reason that <em class="calibre4">ta’veren</em> are born, in order to shift history and restore a balance to the turning of the Wheel.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Tear</strong> (TEER): A nation on the Sea of Storms. Also the capital city of that nation, a great seaport. The banner of Tear is three white crescent moons slanting across a field half red, half gold. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Stone of Tear.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em></strong> (TEER-ahn-GREE-ahl): Remnants of the Age of Legends that use the One Power. Unlike <em class="calibre4">angreal</em> and <em class="calibre4">sa’angreal</em>, each <em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em> was made to do a particular thing. Some <em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em> are used by Aes Sedai, but the original purposes of many are unknown. Some require <a id="page_685" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>channeling, while others may be used by anyone. Some will kill, or destroy the ability to channel of any woman who uses them. Like <em class="calibre4">angreal</em> and <em class="calibre4">sa’angreal</em>, the making of them has been lost since the Breaking of the World. <em class="calibre4">See also angreal; sa’angreal</em>.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Thom Merrilin</strong> (TOM MER-rih-lihn): A not-so-simple gleeman and traveler.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Tinkers:</strong> Properly, the Tuatha’an (too-AH-thah-AHN), also called the Traveling People. A wandering folk who follow a totally pacifist philosophy called the Way of the Leaf, which allows no violence for any reason. Tuatha’an who fall away from this belief are called “the Lost,” and are no longer acknowledged by any others.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">treekillers:</strong> Disparaging term used by the Aiel for Cairhienin, along with “oathbreakers.” Both refer to King Laman’s cutting down of <em class="calibre4">Avendoraldera</em>, a gift from the Aiel, an act which violated the oaths given at the time the gift was given. To the Aiel, both terms rank with the worst that anyone can be called. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Aiel War.</p>
<p class="para1"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Valda, Eamon</strong> (VAHL-dah, AY-mon): An impatient Lord Captain of the Children of the Light, a man who believes you can’t make dinner without breaking eggs and sometimes it is necessary to burn down the barn to get rid of the rats. He sees himself as a pragmatist, and will take whatever advantage offers itself. He is sure that Rand al’Thor is only a puppet of the White Tower and very likely cannot even channel. Hatred of Darkfriends (which of course include Aes Sedai) is the central pillar of his life. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Children of the Light.</p>
<p class="para1"> </p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Warder:</strong> A warrior bonded to an Aes Sedai. The bonding is a thing of the One Power: by it he gains such gifts as quick healing, the ability to go long periods without food, water, or rest, and the ability to sense the taint of the Dark One at a distance. Warder and Aes Sedai share certain physical and emotional knowledge of one another through the bond. So long as a Warder lives, the Aes Sedai to whom he is bonded knows he is alive however far away he is, and when he dies she will know the moment and manner of his death. While most Ajahs believe an Aes Sedai may have one Warder bonded to her at a time, the Red Ajah refuses to bond any Warders at all, and the Green Ajah believes an Aes Sedai may bond as many as she wishes. Ethically the Warder must accede to the bonding voluntarily, but it has been known to happen against the Warder’s will. What the Aes Sedai gain from the bonding is <a id="page_686" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>a closely held secret. By all known historical records, Warders have always been men, but recently a woman has been bonded, revealing certain differences in the effects. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Birgitte.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">weight, units of:</strong> 10 ounces = 1 pound; 10 pounds = 1 stone; 10 stone = 1 hundredweight; 10 hundredweight = 1 ton.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">wilder:</strong> A woman who has learned to channel the One Power on her own; only one in four survive this. Such women usually build barriers against knowing what it is they are doing, but if these can be broken down, wilders are frequently among the most powerful of channelers. The term is often used in derogatory fashion.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Wise One:</strong> Among the Aiel, Wise Ones are women chosen by other Wise Ones and trained in healing, herbs and other things. They have great authority and responsibility, as well as great influence with sept and clan chiefs, though these men often accuse them of meddling. A good many Wise Ones can channel to one degree or another; they find every Aiel woman born with the spark in her and most of those who can learn. The fact that Wise Ones can channel is not spoken of among Aiel, by custom; as a result many Aiel do not know for sure which Wise Ones can and which cannot. Also by custom, Wise Ones avoid all contact with Aes Sedai, even more so than other Aiel. Traditionally, Wise Ones have stood outside all feuds and battle, but this custom has recently been shattered, perhaps beyond mending. What this may do to the protections accorded Wise Ones under the Aiel belief of <em class="calibre4">ji’e’toh</em> has yet to be seen.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para5"><strong class="calibre14">Wise Woman:</strong> One of the fabled healers of Ebou Dar, distinguished by the wearing of a red belt. Their abilities with herbs and their medical knowledge are spoken of as far away as the Borderlands as being the next best to actual Healing by an Aes Sedai. Although Ebou Dar is a cosmopolitan city where outlanders frequently join the city’s many guilds, the oddity has been noted that Wise Women who actually are Ebou Dari are in truth quite rare.</p>
