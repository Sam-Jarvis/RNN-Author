<p class="ct"><span class="epub-i">Into Thakan’dar</span></p>
<p class="tni">Later in the day after her meeting with Rand, Egwene thrust Vora’s <span class="epub-i1">sa’angreal</span> out in front of her and wove Fire. Threads came together, tiny glowing ribbons forming a complex weave in the air before her. She could almost feel their heat shining upon her, turning her skin a violent orange.</p>
<p class="tx">She finished the weave, and a fiery ball as large as a boulder arced in the air, crackling and roaring. It fell upon the distant hilltop like a meteor. The blast flung bow-wielding Trollocs aside, scattering their carcasses.</p>
<p class="tx">Romanda opened a gateway beside Egwene. Romanda was among the Yellows who had insisted on staying at the battlefront to provide emergency Healing. She and her small crew had been invaluable in saving lives.</p>
<p class="tx">Today, however, there would be no opportunity for Healing. The Trollocs had pulled back into the hills, as Bryne had indicated they would. After a day and a half of rest, many of the Aes Sedai were recovered. Not to full strength—not after over a week of grueling combat—but enough.</p>
<p class="tx">Gawyn jumped through the gateway right after it opened, his sword out. Egwene followed, along with Romanda, Lelaine, Leane, Silviana, Raemassa and a handful of Warders and soldiers. They stepped out onto the very hilltop Egwene had just cleared. The charred earth was still warm under her feet, blackened; the scent of burned flesh hung in the air.</p>
<p class="tx">This hill was in the very middle of the Trolloc army. All around, Shadowspawn scrambled for safety this way and that. Romanda held the gateway and Silviana began weaving Air to create a dome of wind against arrows. The rest of them began to send weaves outward.</p>
<p class="tx">The Trollocs reacted slowly—they’d been waiting here, in these hills, ready to surge down into the valleys as Egwene’s army entered. Normally, this would have been a disaster. The Trollocs could rain projectiles down on Egwene’s troops, and her cavalry would have been at a disadvantage trying to get up those hills. The hilltops would have given the Trollocs and Fades a better perspective to spot weak points in Egwene’s forces, and attack accordingly.</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene and her commanders had been disinclined to give the enemy that advantage. The beasts scattered as the battle reversed on them, Aes Sedai seizing the hilltops. Some of the beasts tried to charge up and retake them, but others scrambled away for their lives. Egwene’s heavy cavalry came next, thundering through the valleys. What had once been a very efficient position for the Trollocs became a killing field; with the Trolloc archers removed by Aes Sedai, the heavy cavalry could kill practically unmolested.</p>
<p class="tx">That opened the way for the foot, who marched in formation to sweep the Trollocs back, smashing them against hillsides so that the Aes Sedai could kill them in groups. Unfortunately, the Trollocs had grown more accustomed to facing the One Power. Either that, or the Myrddraal had grown more thorough at encouraging them.</p>
<p class="tx">Soon, more coordinated groups of Trollocs charged the hilltops, while others managed to form resistance to the foot assault. <span class="epub-i1">Bryne is right,</span> Egwene thought, leveling a contingent of Trollocs that had almost clawed their way to her. <span class="epub-i1">The Fades are linked to the Trollocs again.</span> The Shadowspawn had been hesitant to use that tactic recently, as killing the Fade would drop all linked Trollocs. However, she suspected that it was the only way they could make the Trollocs climb toward almost-certain death on these hills.</p>
<p class="tx">If she could find the Myrddraal linked to the Trollocs nearby, she could stop them all with one well-placed weave of Fire. Unfortunately, the Fades were crafty, and had begun hiding among the Trollocs.</p>
<p class="tx">“They’re closing in,” Lelaine said, panting.</p>
<p class="tx">“Fall back,” Egwene said.</p>
<p class="tx">They ducked through Romanda’s gateway, followed by their Warders. Romanda came last, leaping through as a group of Trollocs claimed their hilltop. One of the beasts, a shaggy-furred bearlike monstrosity, stumbled through the gateway after her.</p>
<p class="tx">The thing dropped dead immediately, a faint wisp of smoke rising from its carcass. Its fellows hooted and growled on the other side. Egwene glanced at the other women, then shrugged and released flame straight through the gateway. A few fell dead, twitching, while the others scrambled away, howling, dropping their weapons.</p>
<p class="tx">“That is effective,” Leane noted, folding her arms and raising an immaculate eyebrow at the gateway. It was the middle of the Last Battle, and the woman <span class="epub-i1">still</span> took time each morning to do her face.</p>
<p class="tx">Their gateway had taken them back to camp, which was now mostly empty. With the reserves formed up and ready to move when required, the only soldiers who remained in the camp were a force of five hundred guarding Bryne’s command tent.</p>
<p class="tx">She still carried the pouch with the false seals at her side. Rand’s words had shaken her hard. How would they get the seals back? If the minions of the Shadow broke them at the wrong time, it would be a catastrophe.</p>
<p class="tx">Had they broken them already? Would the world know? Egwene felt a dread she could not abandon. And yet, the war continued, and she had no recourse but to keep fighting. They would think of a way to recover the seals, if they could. Rand swore to try. She wasn’t certain what he could do.</p>
<p class="tx">“They’re fighting so hard,” Gawyn said.</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene turned to find him standing a short distance away, inspecting the battlefield with his looking glass. She felt a longing from him. Without some men to lead as he had the Younglings, she knew, he felt useless in these battles.</p>
<p class="tx">“The Trollocs are driven by Myrddraal,” Egwene said, “linked to give the Fades greater control over them.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes, but <span class="epub-i1">why</span> resist so strongly?” Gawyn said, still looking through the glass. “They don’t care about this land. It’s obvious that these hills are lost to them, and yet they fight savagely. Trollocs are base—they fight and win or they scatter and retreat. They don’t hold land. They’re trying to do so here. It’s like … like the Fades think that even after a rout like this one, they’re in a good position.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Who knows why Fades do what they do?” Lelaine remarked, arms folded, looking through the still-open gateway.</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene turned, looking through it, too. The hilltop was now empty, strangely isolated amid the battle. Her soldiers had crashed up against the Trollocs in the small valley between the hills, and the fighting was brutal down there. She heard grunts, yells, clangs. Bloodied pikes were raised in the air as a group of men were forced back, and halberdiers moved in to try to slow the Trollocs.</p>
<p class="tx">The Shadowspawn were taking terrible casualties. It <span class="epub-i1">was</span> an oddity; Bryne had expected them to retreat.</p>
<p class="tx">“Something’s wrong,” Egwene said, the hairs of her arms standing on end. Her worry about the seals vanished, for now. Her army was in danger. “Gather the Aes Sedai and have the army pull back.”</p>
<p class="tx">The other women looked at her as if she were mad. Gawyn took off at a dash toward the command tent to give her orders. He didn’t question.</p>
<p class="tx">“Mother,” Romanda said, letting her gateway die. “What is—”</p>
<p class="tx">Something split the air on the other side of Egwene’s war camp, opposite the battlefield. A line of light, longer than any gateway Egwene had seen. It was nearly as wide as her <span class="epub-i1">camp itself</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">The line of light turned upon itself, opening a view that was <span class="epub-i1">not</span> of southern Kandor. Instead, it was a place of ferns and drooping trees—though they were brown, like everything else, they were still alien and unfamiliar.</p>
<p class="tx">An enormous army stood silently upon this unfamiliar landscape. Thousands of banners flew above it, emblazoned with symbols Egwene didn’t recognize. The foot soldiers wore knee-length garments that appeared to be some kind of padded armor, reinforced with chain in a large-squared pattern. Others wore metal shirts that seemed sewn from coins tied together.</p>
<p class="tx">Many carried hand axes, though of a very strange design. They had long, thin handles that bulged like bulbs at the end and the axe heads were narrow and thin, almost like picks. The hafts of all of their weapons—from polearms to swords—had a flowing, organic design. Smooth and not of a uniform width, made of some dark red wood that had been painted with colorful dots down the sides.</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene took in all of this in moments, her mind searching for any kind of origin for this strange force. She found nothing to latch on to until she sensed the channeling. The glow of <span class="epub-i1">saidar</span> surrounded <span class="epub-i1">hundreds</span> of women, all of them riding, wearing strange dresses made entirely of stiff black silk. The dresses were not tied at the waists, but instead pulled relatively tight around the shoulders, and flared wide toward the bottoms. Long, rectangular tassels of a multitude of colors hung from ties at the front, just below the neck. The faces of the women were all tattooed.</p>
<p class="tx">“Release the Power,” Egwene said, letting go of <span class="epub-i1">saidar</span>. “Don’t let them sense you!” She dashed to the side, Lelaine following, the glow winking out from around her.</p>
<p class="tx">Romanda ignored Egwene, letting out a curse. She began weaving a gateway to escape.</p>
<p class="tx">A dozen different weaves of fire suddenly thrashed the area where Romanda stood. The woman didn’t have a chance to scream. Egwene and the other women scrambled through the camp as weaves of the One Power destroyed tents, consumed supplies and set the entire place aflame.</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene reached the command tent just as Gawyn stumbled out. She grabbed him and pulled him to the ground as a ball of fire passed just overhead, then crashed into a collection of tents nearby.</p>
<p class="tx">“Light!” Gawyn said. “What is it?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Sharans.” Lelaine, breathless, huddled down beside them.</p>
<p class="tx">“Are you certain?” Egwene whispered.</p>
<p class="tx">Lelaine nodded. “Accounts from the Cairhienin before the Aiel War are plentiful, if not very informative. They weren’t allowed to see much, but what they did see looked a lot like that army.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Army?” Gawyn said, stretching to the side and looking between the tents toward the force marching through the unnaturally wide gateway. “Blood and bloody ashes!” he swore, ducking back. “There are thousands of them!”</p>
<p class="tx">“Far too many to fight,” Egwene agreed, mind working furiously. “Not pinned between them and the Trollocs as we are. We have to fall back.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I just passed the order to Bryne to disengage the troops,” Gawyn said. “But … Egwene. Where are we going to go? Trollocs in front, that army behind! Light. We’ll be crushed between them!”</p>
<p class="tx">Bryne would react quickly. He’d send a messenger through a gateway to the line captains. <span class="epub-i1">Oh no</span> … </p>
<p class="tx">Egwene grabbed Gawyn and pulled him away from the command tent just as she felt channeling within. Lelaine cried out, ducking in the other direction.</p>
<p class="tx">The Sharan women reacted immediately to the channeling. The ground ripped up underneath the tent, destroying it in a burst of overwhelming power. Tattered shreds of cloth flew into the air amid stones and clods of earth.</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene fell backward, and Gawyn pulled her toward a toppled cart that had been hit, one wheel shattered, its burden of firewood tumbling out. Gawyn pulled Egwene to the sheltered place just under the edge of the cart, beside the tumble of wood. They huddled there, though the wood flickered with flames and the ground before them was afire. The heat was distressing, but not unbearable.</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene huddled against the ground, blinking through eyes that burned with smoke, searching for signs of Lelaine. Or … Light! Siuan and Bryne had been inside that tent, along with Yukiri and many of their command staff.</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene and Gawyn hid as flames rained on the camp, tearing up the earth. The Sharans struck at any sign of movement; several serving women who ran by were instantly immolated.</p>
<p class="tx">“Be ready to run,” Gawyn said, “once the fire stops falling.”</p>
<p class="tx">The flames <span class="epub-i1">did</span> wane, but just as they did, riders in Sharan armor charged through the camp. They hooted and yelled, leveling bows at anyone they saw, dropping dozens with arrows to the back. After that, the Sharan troops moved through the camp in tight formations. Egwene waited tensely, trying to think of how to slip away.</p>
<p class="tx">She saw no opportunity. Gawyn pulled Egwene back farther, rubbed soot on her cheeks and motioned for her to stay low, then draped his Warder cloak over them both. With the smoke from the wood burning nearby, perhaps they wouldn’t be seen.</p>
<p class="tx">Her heart thumped urgently in her chest. Gawyn pressed something to her face, a kerchief he had soaked with his waterskin. He held another one to his face and breathed through it. She took the one he was holding to her, but barely breathed. Those soldiers were so <span class="epub-i1">close</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">One of the soldiers turned toward the cart, peering at the woodpile, but when he glanced through the smoke toward them he didn’t seem to see anything. Egwene silently contemplated the Warder cloak. Its color-shifting nature made them nearly invisible, if they were careful not to move.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Why don’t I have one of these cloaks?</span> she thought with annoyance. <span class="epub-i1">Why should they only be for Warders?</span></p>
<p class="tx">The soldiers were busy flushing out servants. Those who ran, they killed with arrows from bows that stretched extremely far. Servants who moved more slowly, they rounded up and forced to the ground.</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene longed to embrace the Source, to do something. To bring down fire and lightning upon these invaders. She still had Vora’s <span class="epub-i1">sa’angreal</span>. She could—</p>
<p class="tx">She quashed that line of thinking. She was surrounded by the enemy, and the swift reaction of the channelers indicated that they were watching for Aes Sedai. If she wove for a single moment, she’d be killed before she could escape. She huddled beside Gawyn, under his cloak, hoping none of the Sharan channelers walked close enough to sense her ability. She could use a weave to hide that ability, but would have to channel first to use it. Dared she try that?</p>
<p class="tx">They hid for a good hour or more. If the cloud cover hadn’t been so complete, casting the land into perpetual twilight, they’d certainly have been spotted, cloak or no cloak. She almost cried out at one point when a few of the Sharan soldiers tossed some buckets of water onto the woodpile, stifling the fire and soaking both of them.</p>
<p class="tx">She couldn’t make out anything of her own army, though she feared the worst. The Sharan channelers and a large portion of their army moved through the camp quickly, toward the battlefield. With Bryne and the Amyrlin gone, and with a surprise force coming in from behind … </p>
<p class="tx">Egwene felt sick. How many were dying, dead? Gawyn caught her arm as he felt her stir, then shook his head, mouthing a few words. <span class="epub-i1">Wait until night.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">They’re dying!</span> she mouthed.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">You can’t help.</span></p>
<p class="tx">It was true. She let him hold her, letting his familiar scent calm her. But how could she simply <span class="epub-i1">wait</span> as soldiers and Aes Sedai who depended on her were slaughtered? Light, a huge portion of the White Tower was out there! If this army fell, and those women with it … </p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">I am the Amyrlin Seat,</span> she told herself firmly. <span class="epub-i1">I will be strong. I will survive. So long as I live, the White Tower stands.</span></p>
<p class="tx">She still let Gawyn hold her.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Aviendha crawled across the rock like a winter lizard seeking warmth. Her fingertips, though callused, were beginning to burn from the bitter cold. Shayol Ghul was cold, with air that smelled as if it came from a tomb.</p>
<p class="tx">Rhuarc crawled to her left, a Stone Dog named Shaen to her right. Both wore the red headband of the <span class="epub-i1">siswai’aman</span>. She didn’t know what to make of Rhuarc, a clan chief, donning that headband. He had never spoken of it; it was as if the headband did not exist. So it was with all of the <span class="epub-i1">siswai’aman</span>. Amys crawled on Shaen’s right. For once, no one had objected to Wise Ones joining the advance scouts. In a place such as this, at a time such as this, the eyes of one who could channel might see what ordinary eyes would not.</p>
<p class="tx">Aviendha pulled herself forward, making no noise, despite the necklaces she wore. No plants sprouted on these rocks, not even mold or lichen. They were deep within the Blasted Lands, now. Almost as deep as one could go.</p>
<p class="tx">Rhuarc reached the ridge first, and she saw him tense. Aviendha arrived next, peering over the side of the rock, keeping low so as not to be seen. Her breath stopped dead in her throat.</p>
<p class="tx">She’d heard stories of this place. Of the massive forge near the base of the slope, a single black stream running past it. That water had been poisoned to the point that it would kill any who touched it. Hearths dotted the valley like open wounds, reddening the fog around them. As a young Maiden, she’d listened with wide eyes as an ancient roofmistress told of the creatures who worked the Shadow’s forges, creatures that were not dead and not alive. Silent and horrible, the brutish things moved with steps that held no life—like the ticking hands of a clock.</p>
<p class="tx">The forgers paid little heed to the cages full of humans whose blood would be spilled to temper newly forged blades. The captives might as well have been chunks of iron. Though Aviendha was too far to hear the humans’ whimpers, she felt them. Her fingers grew taut upon the rocks.</p>
<p class="tx">Shayol Ghul itself dominated the valley, its black slopes rising like a serrated knife into the sky. The sides were rent with cuts, like the skin of a man who had been whipped a hundred times, each score leaving a gash that spat steam. Perhaps that steam created the fog that lay over the valley. The fog churned and surged, as if the valley were a cup holding liquid.</p>
<p class="tx">“Such a terrible place,” Amys whispered.</p>
<p class="tx">Aviendha had never heard such dread in the woman’s voice. That chilled Aviendha nearly as much as the bitter wind that ruffled their clothing. Distant <span class="epub-i1">ping</span>s broke the air, the workers forging. A black column of smoke rose from the nearest forge, and did not dissipate. It rose like an umbilical cord to the clouds above, which rained down lightning with dreadful frequency.</p>
<p class="tx">Yes, Aviendha had heard stories of this place. Those stories had failed to convey the full truth. One could not <span class="epub-i1">describe</span> this place. One had to experience it.</p>
<p class="tx">A scraping from behind, and in a few moments, Rodel Ituralde crawled up next to Rhuarc. He moved quietly, for a wetlander.</p>
<p class="tx">“You were so impatient that you could not await our report?” Rhuarc asked softly.</p>
<p class="tx">“No report can convey what a man’s own eyes can,” Ituralde said. “I didn’t promise I’d stay behind. I told you to go ahead. And you did.” He raised his looking glass, shading the front with his hand, though that probably wasn’t necessary with those clouds.</p>
<p class="tx">Rhuarc frowned. He and the other Aiel who had come north had agreed to follow a wetlander general, but it did not sit well with them. Nor should it. They would do this thing without growing comfortable. Comfort was the great killer of men.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Let it be enough,</span> Aviendha thought, turning back to look at the valley. <span class="epub-i1">Enough for my people. Enough for Rand and the task he must accomplish.</span></p>
<p class="tx">Seeing the end of her people had nauseated and horrified her, but also awakened her. If the end of the Aiel was the sacrifice required for Rand to win, she would make it. She would scream and curse the Creator’s own name, but she would pay that price. Any warrior would. Better that one people should end than the world fall completely under Shadow.</p>
<p class="tx">The Light willing, it would not come to that. The Light willing, her actions with the Dragon’s Peace would serve to protect and shelter the Aiel. She would not let the possibility of failure stop her. They would fight. Waking from the dream was always a possibility when the spears were danced.</p>
<p class="tx">“Interesting,” Ituralde said softly, still looking through his glass. “Your thoughts, Aiel?”</p>
<p class="tx">“We need to create a distraction,” Rhuarc said. “We can come down the slope just to the east of the forge and set those captives free and break the place apart. This stops the Myrddraal from receiving new weapons and will keep the Dark One’s eyes on us and not the <span class="epub-i1">Car’a’carn</span>.”</p>
<p class="tx">“How long will it take the Dragon?” Ituralde asked. “What do you think, Aiel? How much time do we give him to save the world?”</p>
<p class="tx">“He will fight,” Amys said. “Enter the mountain, duel with Sightblinder. It will take as long as a fight needs to take. A few hours, perhaps? I have not seen a duel last much longer than that, even between two men of great skill.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Let us assume,” Ituralde said with a smile, “that there is going to be more to it than a duel.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I am not a fool, Rodel Ituralde,” Amys said coolly. “I doubt that the <span class="epub-i1">Car’a’carn</span>’s fight will be one of spears and shields. However, when he cleansed the Source, did that not happen in the space of a single day? Perhaps this will be similar.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Perhaps,” Ituralde said. “Perhaps not.” He lowered the glass and looked to the Aiel. “Which possibility would you rather plan for?”</p>
<p class="tx">“The worst one,” Aviendha said.</p>
<p class="tx">“So we plan to hold out as long as the Dragon needs,” Ituralde said. “Days, weeks, months … years? As long as it takes.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rhuarc nodded slowly. “What do you suggest?”</p>
<p class="tx">“The pass into the valley is narrow,” Ituralde said. “Scout reports put most of the Shadowspawn left in the Blight out beyond the pass there. Even they spend as little time as they can in this forsaken place. If we can close off the pass and seize this valley—destroy those forgeworkers and the few Fades down there—we could hold this place for ages. You Aiel are good at slash-and-run tactics. Burn me, but I know <span class="epub-i1">that</span> from personal experience. You lot attack that forge, and we’ll set about closing up the pass.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rhuarc nodded. “It is a good plan.”</p>
<p class="tx">The four of them walked down the ridge to where Rand waited, dressed in red and gold, arms behind his back, accompanied by a force of twenty Maidens and six Asha’man, plus Nynaeve and Moiraine. He seemed very troubled by something—she could feel his anxiety—though he should have been pleased. He had convinced the Seanchan to fight. What was it that, in his meeting with Egwene al’Vere, had disturbed him so?</p>
<p class="tx">Rand turned and looked upward, toward the peak of Shayol Ghul. Staring at it, his emotions changed. He seemed a man looking at a fountain in the Three-fold Land, savoring the idea of cool water. Aviendha could feel his anticipation. There was also fear in him, of course. No warrior ever rid himself completely of the fear. He controlled it, overwhelmed it with the thirst to be on with the fight, to test himself.</p>
<p class="tx">Men or women could not know themselves, not truly, until they were strained to their absolute limit. Until they danced the spears with death, felt their blood seeping out to stain the ground, and drove the weapon home into the beating heart of an enemy. Rand al’Thor wanted this, and she understood him because of it. Strange to realize, after all of this time, just how alike they were.</p>
<p class="tx">She stepped up to him, and he moved so that he stood just beside her, his shoulder touching hers. He did not drape an arm around her, and she did not take his hand. He did not own her, and she did not own him. The act of his movement so that they faced the same direction meant far more to her than any other gesture could.</p>
<p class="tx">“Shade of my heart,” he said softly, watching his Asha’man open a gateway, “what did you see?”</p>
<p class="tx">“A tomb,” she replied.</p>
<p class="tx">“Mine?”</p>
<p class="tx">“No. That of your enemy. The place where he was buried once, and the place he will slumber again.”</p>
<p class="tx">Something hardened inside Rand. She could feel it, his resolve.</p>
<p class="tx">“You mean to kill him,” Aviendha whispered. “Sightblinder himself.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="tx">She waited.</p>
<p class="tx">“Others tell me I am a fool for thinking this,” Rand said. His guards moved through the gateway to return to Merrilor.</p>
<p class="tx">“No warrior should enter a battle without intending to see that battle finished,” Aviendha said. She hesitated after saying it, something else occurring to her.</p>
<p class="tx">“What is it?” Rand asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“Well, the <span class="epub-i1">greatest</span> victory would be to take your enemy <span class="epub-i1">gai’shain</span>.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I doubt he would submit to that,” Rand said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Don’t make jest,” she said, elbowing him in the side, earning a grunt. “This must be considered, Rand al’Thor. Which is the better way of <span class="epub-i1">ji’e’toh</span>? Is imprisoning the Dark One like taking him <span class="epub-i1">gai’shain</span>? If so, that would be the proper path.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m not certain I care what is ‘proper’ this time, Aviendha.”</p>
<p class="tx">“A warrior must <span class="epub-i1">always</span> consider <span class="epub-i1">ji’e’toh</span>,” she said sternly. “Have I taught you nothing? Do not speak like that, or you will shame me again before the other Wise Ones.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I had hoped that—considering how our relationship has progressed—we would be through with the lectures, Aviendha.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You thought that growing closer to me would <span class="epub-i1">end</span> the lectures?” she asked, baffled. “Rand al’Thor, I have been among wetlander wives, and I’ve seen that they—”</p>
<p class="tx">He shook his head, leading the way through the gateway, Aviendha following. He seemed amused, and that was good. Some of his anxiety had faded. But truly, this was not a jest. Wetlanders did not have good senses of humor. Sometimes, they did not understand at all when to laugh.</p>
<p class="tx">On the other side of the gateway, they entered a camp made up of many groups. Rand had command of the Maidens and the <span class="epub-i1">siswai’aman</span>, along with most of the Wise Ones.</p>
<p class="tx">Just outside of the Aiel camp were the Aes Sedai. Rand had command of some three dozen—all of the Aes Sedai who had sworn to him personally, and most who were bonded to his Asha’man. That meant another two dozen Asha’man, of various ranks.</p>
<p class="tx">He also had Rodel Ituralde and his force, composed primarily of Domani. Their king, with his wispy beard and the beauty mark on his cheek, rode with them as well, but left the command to the great captain. The monarch gestured, and Ituralde walked over to give a report. Alsalam seemed uncomfortable around Rand, and did not go on any excursions when the Dragon did. Aviendha liked that arrangement. She wasn’t certain she trusted this Alsalam.</p>
<p class="tx">Outside the Aiel tents camped another large military force, the Tairen army, including the elite force known as the Defenders of the Stone, led by a man named Rodrivar Tihera. Their king was with them as well, and was generally considered the highest authority in their gathered armies, aside from Rand.</p>
<p class="tx">The Tairens would form a key part of Rodel Ituralde’s plans. As much as it galled Aviendha to admit it, Ituralde was right. The Aiel were not a defensive force, and though they could hold a pass if needed, they would be better used for offensive maneuvers.</p>
<p class="tx">The Tairens would be perfect for holding ground. They had well-trained companies of pikemen, and a full banner of crossbowmen with a new kind of crossbow crank, knowledge of which the smiths had only just received. They had spent the last week converting the equipment to the new style.</p>
<p class="tx">There was one other group in Rand’s force, and it was the most baffling to Aviendha. Dragonsworn in large numbers. They camped together, and flew a flag that placed the image of the dragon over the ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai. The group was made up of common men, soldiers, lords, ladies and some Aes Sedai and Warders. They came from all nations, including the Aiel, and shared only one common bond: They had put aside all loyalties, broken all bonds, to fight in the Last Battle. Aviendha had heard discomforting rumors that many of the Aiel among them were <span class="epub-i1">gai’shain</span> who had put aside the white, claiming they would take it up again when the Last Battle was won.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand’s coming was said to remove all bonds from men. Oaths shattered when he drew near, and any loyalty or alliance was secondary to the need to serve him in this last fight for humankind. Part of her wanted to name that wetlander foolishness, but perhaps she used that term too easily. A Wise One had to see with better eyes than that.</p>
<p class="tx">Now that they were on the other side of the gateway, Aviendha finally allowed herself to release <span class="epub-i1">saidar</span>. The world dulled around her, the added sense of life and wonder evaporating. Every time she released the One Power, she felt slightly hollow, the joy and thrill now passed, over.</p>
<p class="tx">Ituralde and Rhuarc went to join King Darlin, speaking together about their battle plans. Aviendha joined Rand as he walked toward his tent.</p>
<p class="tx">“The dagger worked,” Rand said. He reached down and fingered the black sheath that held the dull dagger. “Artham. I had heard them spoken of, back in the Age of Legends, but nobody created one. I wonder who finally managed it…”</p>
<p class="tx">“Are you certain it worked?” Aviendha said. “He could have been watching you, but not exposed his hand.”</p>
<p class="tx">“No, I would have felt the attention,” Rand said. “It <span class="epub-i1">did</span> work. With this, he won’t sense me until I step right up to the Bore. Once he does know I’m there, he will have trouble envisioning me, striking at me directly. Aviendha, that you should find this and identify it when you did, that Elayne should give it to me … The Pattern weaves us all where we need to be.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand smiled, then added, “Elayne sounded sad when she gave me the dagger. I think a part of her wanted to keep it because it would let her curse by the Dark One’s name without drawing his attention.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Is this really a time for levity?” Aviendha asked, scowling at him.</p>
<p class="tx">“If ever there was a need for laughter, this is it,” Rand said, though the laughter seemed to have left his voice. That anxiety of his returned as they reached his tent.</p>
<p class="tx">“What is troubling you?” Aviendha asked him.</p>
<p class="tx">“They have the seals,” Rand said.</p>
<p class="tx">“What!”</p>
<p class="tx">“Only Egwene knows, but it is true. They were stolen, perhaps from my hiding place, perhaps after I delivered them to Egwene.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Then they are broken.”</p>
<p class="tx">“No,” Rand said. “I would feel that. I think they must be waiting. Perhaps they know that in breaking the seals, they clear the way for me to reforge his prison. They’ll break them at just the wrong moment, to let the Dark One touch the world, perhaps to give him the strength to overwhelm me as I face him…”</p>
<p class="tx">“We will find a way to stop this,” Aviendha said, voice firm.</p>
<p class="tx">He looked to her and smiled. “Always the warrior.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Of course.” What else would she be?</p>
<p class="tx">“I have another concern. The Forsaken will try to strike at me when I enter to face him. The Dark One cannot see me, does not know where I am, and so is committing some of his forces to each of the different battlefronts. The Shadow pushes hard at Lan, trying to destroy him—the Dark One presses Elayne almost as badly in Cairhien. Only Egwene seems to be having some success.</p>
<p class="tx">“He searches for me at each of these battlefields, committing his creatures in large numbers. When we attack Shayol Ghul, we should be able to hold the valley against armies. The Forsaken, however, will come through gateways. Holding a pass will not stop them, or the Dreadlords, male or female. My confrontation with the Dark One will draw them as the cleansing did—only a thousand times more urgently. They will come, with fire and thunder, and they will kill.”</p>
<p class="tx">“So will we.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m counting on it,” Rand said. “But I cannot afford to take you into the cavern with me, Aviendha.”</p>
<p class="tx">She felt a sinking feeling, though she attacked it, stabbed it, left it to die. “I suspected. Do not think to send me away to safety, Rand al’Thor. You would—”</p>
<p class="tx">“I wouldn’t dare,” he said. “I’d fear for my life if I were to try—there isn’t any place that is safe, now. I cannot take you into the cavern because you will be needed out in the valley, watching for the Forsaken and the seals. I <span class="epub-i1">need</span> you, Aviendha. I need all three of you to watch, to be my hands—my heart—during this fight. I am going to send Min to Egwene. Something is going to happen there, I’m certain. Elayne will fight in the south, and you … I need you in the valley of Thakan’dar, watching my back.</p>
<p class="tx">“I will leave orders for the Aes Sedai and Asha’man, Aviendha. Ituralde leads our troops, but <span class="epub-i1">you</span> command our channelers at Shayol Ghul. You must keep the enemy from entering the cavern after me. You are my spear in this battle. If they reach me while I am in the cavern, I will be helpless. What I must do will take all of me—all of my concentration, every scrap of power I have. I’ll be like a babe lying in the wilderness, defenseless against the beasts.”</p>
<p class="tx">“And how is this different from how you usually are, Rand al’Thor?” she asked.</p>
<p class="tx">He laughed. It felt good to be able to both see and feel that smile. “I thought you said this wasn’t a time for levity.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Someone must keep you humble,” Aviendha said. “It would not do for you to think yourself something grand, simply because you save the world.”</p>
<p class="tx">He laughed again, leading her up to the tent where Min was. Nynaeve and Moiraine waited there, too, one with annoyance on her face, the other serenity. Nynaeve looked very odd with her hair not long enough to braid. Today, she’d pulled it up and pinned it back.</p>
<p class="tx">Moiraine sat quietly on a large stone, <span class="epub-i1">Callandor</span>—the Sword That Is Not a Sword—lying across her lap, one hand resting protectively on its hilt. Thom sat beside her, whittling a stick and whistling softly to himself.</p>
<p class="tx">“You should have taken me, Rand,” Nynaeve said, folding her arms.</p>
<p class="tx">“You had work to do,” Rand said. “You have tried as I instructed?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Time and time again,” Nynaeve said. “There’s no way around the flaw, Rand. You <span class="epub-i1">cannot</span> use <span class="epub-i1">Callandor</span>. It will be too dangerous.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand came up to Moiraine, reaching out his hand, and she lifted <span class="epub-i1">Callandor</span> for him to take. He raised it up before him, looking through its crystalline substance. It started to glow softly. “Min, I have a task for you,” he whispered. “Egwene is progressing well, and I feel her battlefront will be key. I wish you to go and watch her and the Seanchan Empress, whom I have asked to join that battlefront once their forces are ready.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You would have the Seanchan join <span class="epub-i1">Egwene’s</span> battlefront?” Moiraine asked, aghast. “Is that wise?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I cannot tell wisdom from brashness these days,” Rand said. “But I would feel better if someone were keeping an eye on those two factions. Min, will you do it?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I was hoping…” Min looked away.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Hoping he’d take her into the cavern,</span> Aviendha thought. But of course he could not.</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m sorry, Min,” Rand said. “But I need you.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I will do it.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Rand,” Nynaeve said. “You are taking <span class="epub-i1">Callandor</span> when you attack him? Its weakness … so long as you are channeling into that … <span class="epub-i1">thing</span>, anyone can seize control of you. They can use you, and can draw the One Power through <span class="epub-i1">Callandor</span> into you until it burns you out—leaving you powerless, and leaving them with the strength to level mountains, destroy cities.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I will take it,” Rand said.</p>
<p class="tx">“But it’s a trap!” Nynaeve said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes,” Rand said, sounding tired. “A trap I must stride into and allow to spring shut upon me.” He laughed, suddenly, throwing his head back. “As always! Why should I be surprised? Spread the word, Nynaeve. Tell Ituralde, Rhuarc, King Darlin. Tomorrow, we invade Shayol Ghul and claim it as our own! If we must put our head into the lion’s mouth, let us make certain that he chokes upon our flesh!”</p>
