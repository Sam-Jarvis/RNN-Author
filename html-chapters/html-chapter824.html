<p class="chapterOpenerText">Ishikk splashed toward the meeting with the strange foreigners, whistling softly to himself, his pole with buckets on each end resting on his shoulders. He wore lake sandals on his submerged feet and a pair of knee-length breeches. No shirt. Nu Ralik forbid! A good Purelaker never covered his shoulders when the sun was shining. A man could get sick that way, not getting enough sunlight.</p>
<p class="para">He whistled, but not because he was having a pleasant day. In point of fact, the day Nu Ralik had provided was close to horrible. Only five fish swam in Ishikk’s buckets, and four were of the dullest, most common variety. The tides had been irregular, as if the Purelake itself was in a foul mood. Bad days were coming; sure as the sun and the tide, they were.</p>
<p class="para">The Purelake extended in all directions, hundreds of miles wide, its glassy surface perfectly transparent. At its deepest, it was never more than six feet from shimmering surface to the bottom—and in most places, the warm, slow-moving water came up only to about mid calf. It was filled with tiny fish, colorful cremlings, and eel-like riverspren.</p>
<p class="para">The Purelake was life itself. Once, this land had been claimed by a king. Sela Tales, the nation had been called, one of the Epoch Kingdoms. Well, they could name it what they wanted, but Nu Ralik knew that the boundaries of nature were far more important than the boundaries of nations. Ishikk was a Purelaker. First and foremost. By tide and sun he was.</p>
<p class="para">He walked confidently through the water, though the footing could sometimes be precarious. The pleasantly warm water lapped at his legs just below the knees, and he made very few splashes. He knew to move slowly, careful not to put his weight down before he was sure he wasn’t stepping on a spikemane or a sharp lip of rock.</p>
<p class="para">Ahead, the village of Fu Abra broke the glassy perfection, a cluster of buildings perched on blocks beneath the water. Their domed roofs made them look like the rockbuds that sprouted from the ground, and they were the only things for miles around that broke the surface of the Purelake.</p>
<p class="para">Other people walked about here, moving with the same slow gait. It was possible to run through the water, but there was rarely a reason. What could be so important that you had to go and make a splash and ruckus getting to it?</p>
<p class="para">Ishikk shook his head at that. Only foreigners were so hasty. He nodded to Thaspic, a dark-skinned man who passed him pulling a small raft. It was stacked with a few piles of cloth; he’d probably taken them out for washing.</p>
<p class="para">“Ho, Ishikk,” the scrawny man said. “How’s fishing?”</p>
<p class="para">“Terrible,” he called. “Vun Makak has blighted me right good today. And you?”</p>
<p class="para">“Lost a shirt while washing,” Thaspic replied, his voice pleasant.</p>
<p class="para">“Ah, that’s the way of things. Are my foreigners here?”</p>
<p class="para">“Sure are. Over at Maib’s place.”</p>
<p class="para">“Vun Makak send they don’t eat her out of home,” Ishikk said, continuing on his way. “Or infect her with their constant worries.”</p>
<p class="para">“Sun and tides send it!” Thaspic said with a chuckle, continuing on.</p>
<p class="para">Maib’s house was near the center of the village. Ishikk wasn’t sure what made her want to live inside the building. Most nights he did just fine sleeping on his raft. It never got cold in the Purelake, except during highstorms, and you could last through those right well, Nu Ralik send the way.</p>
<p class="para">The Purelake drained into pits and holes when the storms came, and so you just shoved your raft into a crevice between two ridges of stone and huddled up next to it, using it to break the fury of the tempest. The storms weren’t so bad out here as they were in the East, where they flung boulders and blew down buildings. Oh, he’d heard stories about that sort of life. Nu Ralik send he never had to go to such a terrible place.</p>
<p class="para">Besides, it was probably cold there. Ishikk pitied those who had to live in the cold. Why didn’t they just come to the Purelake?</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Nu Ralik send that they don’t,</span> he thought, walking up to Maib’s place. If everyone knew how nice the Purelake was, surely they’d all want to live here, and there wouldn’t be a place to walk without stumbling over some foreigner!</p>
<p class="para">He stepped up into the building, exposing his calves to the air. The floor was low enough that a few inches of water still covered it; Purelakers liked it that way. It was natural, though if the tide dropped, sometimes buildings would drain.</p>
<p class="para">Minnows shot out around his toes. Common types, not worth anything. Maib stood inside, fixing a pot of fish soup, and she nodded to him. She was a stout woman and had been chasing Ishikk for years, trying to bait him to wed her on account of her fine cooking. He just might let her catch him someday.</p>
<p class="para">His foreigners were in the corner, at a table only they would choose—the one that was raised up an extra bit, with footrests so that the outsiders wouldn’t have to get their toes wet. <span class="italic1">Nu Ralik, what fools!</span> he thought with amusement. <span class="italic1">Inside out of the sun, wearing shirts against its warmth, feet out of the tide. No wonder their thoughts are so odd.</span></p>
<p class="para">He set his buckets down, nodding to Maib.</p>
<p class="para">She eyed him. “Good fishing?”</p>
<p class="para">“Terrible.”</p>
<p class="para">“Ah well, your soup is free today, Ishikk. To make up for Vun Makak’s cursing.”</p>
<p class="para">“Thanks much kindly,” he said, taking a steaming bowl from her. She smiled. Now he owed her. Enough bowls, and he’d be forced to wed her.</p>
<p class="para">“There’s a kolgril in the bucket for you,” he noted. “Caught it early this morning.”</p>
<p class="para">Her stout face grew uncertain. A kolgril was a <span class="italic1">very</span> lucky fish. Cured aching joints for a good month after you ate it, and sometimes let you see when friends were going to visit by letting you read the shapes of the clouds. Maib had quite a fondness for them, on account of the finger aches Nu Ralik had sent her. One kolgril would be two weeks of soup, and would put <span class="italic1">her</span> in debt to <span class="italic1">him</span>.</p>
<p class="para">“Vun Makak eye you,” she muttered in annoyance walking over to check. “That’s one all right. How am I ever going to catch you, man?”</p>
<p class="para">“I’m a fisher, Maib,” he said, taking a slurp of his soup—the bowl was shaped for easy slurping. “Hard to catch a fisher. You know that.” He chuckled to himself, walking up to his foreigners as she plucked out the kolgril.</p>
<p class="para">There were three of them. Two were dark-skinned Makabaki, though they were the strangest Makabaki he’d ever seen. One was thick limbed where most of his kind were small and fine-boned, and he had a completely bald head. The other was taller, with short dark hair, lean muscles, and broad shoulders. In his head, Ishikk called them Grump and Blunt, on account of their personalities.</p>
<p class="para">The third man had light tan skin, like an Alethi. He didn’t seem quite right either, though. The eyes were the wrong shape, and his accent was certainly <span class="italic1">not</span> Alethi. He spoke the Selay language worse than the other two, and usually stayed quiet. He seemed thoughtful, though. Ishikk called him Thinker.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Wonder how he earned that scar across his scalp,</span> Ishikk thought. Life outside the Purelake was very dangerous. Lots of wars, particularly to the east.</p>
<p class="para">“You are late, traveler,” said tall, stiff Blunt. He had the build and air of a soldier, though none of the three carried weapons.</p>

<p class="para">Ishikk frowned, sitting and reluctantly pulling his feet out of the water. “Isn’t it warli-day?”</p>
<p class="para">“The day is right, friend,” Grump said. “But we were to meet at noon. Understand?” He generally did most of the talking.</p>
<p class="para">“We’re close to that,” Ishikk said. Honestly. Who paid attention to what <span class="italic1">hour</span> it was? Foreigners. Always so busy.</p>
<p class="para">Grump just shook his head as Maib brought them some soup. Her place was the closest thing the village had to an inn. She left Ishikk a soft cloth napkin and nice cup of sweet wine, trying to balance that fish as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="para">“Very well,” Grump said. “Let us have your report, friend.”</p>
<p class="para">“I’ve been by Fu Ralis, Fu Namir, Fu Albast, and Fu Moorin this month,” Ishikk said, taking a slurp of soup. “Nobody has seen this man you search for.”</p>
<p class="para">“You asked right questions?” Blunt said. “You are certain?”</p>
<p class="para">“Of course I’m certain,” Ishikk said. “I have been doing this for ages now.”</p>
<p class="para">“Five months,” Blunt corrected. “And no results.”</p>
<p class="para">Ishikk shrugged. “You wish me to make up stories? Vun Makak would like me to do that.”</p>
<p class="para">“No, no stories, friend,” Grump said. “We want only the truth.”</p>
<p class="para">“Well, I’ve given it to you.”</p>
<p class="para">“You swear it by Nu Ralik, that god of yours?”</p>
<p class="para">“Hush!” Ishikk said. “Don’t say his name. Are you idiots?”</p>
<p class="para">Grump frowned. “But he is your god. Understand? Is his name holy? Not to be spoken?”</p>
<p class="para">Foreigners were so stupid. Of course Nu Ralik was their god, but you always <span class="italic1">pretended</span> that he wasn’t. Vun Makak—his younger, spiteful brother—had to be tricked into thinking you worshipped him, otherwise he’d get jealous. It was only safe to speak of these things in a holy grotto.</p>
<p class="para">“I swear it by Vun Makak,” Ishikk said pointedly. “May he watch over me and curse me as he pleases. I have looked diligently. No foreigner like this one you mention—with his white hair, clever tongue, and arrowlike face—has been seen.”</p>
<p class="para">“He dyes his hair sometimes,” Grump said. “And wears disguises.”</p>
<p class="para">“I’ve asked, using the names you gave me,” Ishikk said. “Nobody has seen him. Now, perhaps I could find you a <span class="italic1">fish</span> that could locate him.” Ishikk rubbed his stubbly chin. “I’ll bet a stumpy cort could do it. Might take me a while to find one, though.”</p>
<p class="para">The three looked at him. “There may be something to these fish, you know,” Blunt said.</p>
<p class="para">“Superstition,” Grump replied. “You always look for superstition, Vao.”</p>

<p class="para">Vao wasn’t the man’s real name; Ishikk was sure they used fake names. That was why he used his own names for them. If they were going to give him fake names, he’d give them fake names back.</p>
<p class="para">“And you, Temoo?” Blunt snapped. “We can’t pontificate our way to—”</p>
<p class="para">“Gentlemen,” Thinker said. He nodded to Ishikk, who was still slurping his soup. All three of them switched to another language and continued their argument.</p>
<p class="para">Ishikk listened with half an ear, trying to determine what language it was. He never had been good with other kinds of languages. Why did he need them? Didn’t help with fishing or selling fish.</p>
<p class="para">He <span class="italic1">had</span> searched for their man. He got around a lot, visited a lot of places around the Purelake. It was one of the reasons why he didn’t want to be caught by Maib. He’d have to settle down, and that wasn’t good for catching fish. Not the rare ones, at least.</p>
<p class="para">He didn’t bother wondering why they were looking for this Hoid, whoever he was. Foreigners were always looking for things they couldn’t have. Ishikk sat back, dangling his toes in the water. That felt good. Eventually, they finished their argument. They gave him some more instructions, handed him a pouch of spheres, and stepped down into the water.</p>
<p class="para">Like most foreigners, they wore thick boots that came all the way up to their knees. They splashed in the water as they walked to the entrance. Ishikk followed, waving to Maib and picking up his buckets. He’d be back later in the day for an evening meal.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Maybe I</span> should <span class="italic1">let her catch me,</span> he thought, stepping back out into the sunlight and sighing in relief. <span class="italic1">Nu Ralik knows I’m getting old. Might be nice to relax.</span></p>
<p class="para">His foreigners splashed down into the Purelake. Grump was last. He seemed very dissatisfied. “Where are you, Roamer? What a fool’s quest this is.” Then, he added in his own tongue, <span class="italic1">“Alavanta kamaloo kayana.”</span></p>
<p class="para">He splashed after his companions.</p>
<p class="para">“Well, you’ve got the ‘fool’ part right,” Ishikk said with a chuckle, turning his own direction and heading off to check on his traps.</p>
