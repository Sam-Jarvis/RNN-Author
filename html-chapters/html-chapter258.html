<div class="p"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">T</span>aking Stepper’s bridle, Verin led him to the Winespring Inn herself, the crowd melting back to let her through, then falling in after. Dannil and Ban and the others trailed along on horse and afoot, kin mingling with them now. Astounded as they were by the changes in Emond’s Field, the lads still showed their pride by striding even if they limped, or sitting up straighter in the saddle; they had faced Trollocs and come home. But women ran their hands over sons and nephews and grandsons, often biting back tears, and their low moans made a soft, pained murmur. Tight-eyed men tried to hide their worries behind proud smiles, clapping shoulders and exclaiming over newly begun beards, yet frequently their hugs just happened to turn into a shoulder to lean on. Sweethearts rushed in with kisses and loud cries, equal parts happiness and commiseration, and little brothers and sisters, uncertain, alternated between fits of weeping and clinging in wide-eyed wonder to a brother everyone seemed to be taking for a hero.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">It was the other voices Perrin wished he could not hear.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Where is Kenley?” Mistress Ahan was a handsome woman, with streaks of white in her nearly black braid, but she wore a fear-filled frown as she scanned faces and saw eyes flinch from hers. “Where’s my Kenley?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Bili!” old Hu al’Dai called uncertainly. “Has anyone seen Bili al’Dai?”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“ . . . Hu . . . !”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“ . . . Jared . . . !”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“ . . . Tim . . . !”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“ . . . Colly . . . !”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">In front of the inn, Perrin fell out of the saddle in his need to escape those names, not even seeing whose hands caught him. “Get me inside!” he grated. “Inside!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“ . . . Teven . . . !”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“ . . . Haral . . . !”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“ . . . Had . . . !”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The door cut off the heart-lost wails, and the cries of Dael al’Taron’s mother for someone to tell her where her son was.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">In a Trolloc cookpot</span>, Perrin thought as he was lowered into a chair in the common room. <span class="calibre18">In a Trolloc’s belly, where I put him, Mistress al’Taron. Where I put him.</span> Faile had his head in her hands, peering into his face worriedly. <span class="calibre18">Care for the living</span>, he thought. <span class="calibre18">I’ll weep for the dead later. Later.</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I am all right,” he told her. “I just got a little light-headed dismounting. I’ve never been a good rider.” She did not seem to believe him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Can’t you do something?” she demanded of Verin.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Aes Sedai calmly shook her head. “I think better not, child. A pity neither of us is Yellow, but Alanna is still a much better Healer than I. My Talents lie in other directions. Ihvon will bring her. Wait with patience, child.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The common room had been turned into an armory of sorts. Except in front of the fireplace, the walls were a solid mass of propped spears of every description, with the occasional halberd or bill mixed in, and some polearms with oddly shaped blades, many pitted and discolored where old rust had been scoured away. Even more surprisingly, a barrel near the foot of the stairs held swords all jumbled together, most without scabbards and no two alike. Every attic within five miles must have been turned out for relics dust-covered for generations. Perrin would not have suspected there were five swords in the whole Two Rivers. Before the Whitecloaks and Trollocs came, anyway.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Gaul took a place off to one side, near the stairs that led up to the inn’s rooms and the al’Veres’ living quarters, watching Perrin but plainly aware of Verin and every move she made. On the other side of the room, watching Faile and all else, the two Maidens cradled their spears in the crook of an elbow and took a hipshot stance that seemed at once casual and yet balanced
on the toes. The three young fellows who had carried Perrin in shifted their feet by the door, staring at him and the Aes Sedai and the Aiel with equally wide eyes. That was all.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The others,” Perrin said. “They need—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“They will be taken care of,” Verin interrupted smoothly, seating herself at another table. “They will want to be with their families. Much better to have loved ones close.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin felt a stab of pain—the graves below the apple trees flashed in his mind—but he pushed it down. <span class="calibre18">Take care of the living</span>, he reminded himself harshly. The Aes Sedai brought out her pen and ink and began making notes in that small book in a precise hand. He wondered whether she cared how many Two Rivers folk died, so long as he lived, to be used in the White Tower’s plans for Rand.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Faile squeezed his hand, but it was to the Aes Sedai that she spoke. “Should we not take him up to a bed?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Not yet,” Perrin told her irritably. Verin looked up and opened her mouth, and he repeated in a firmer voice, “Not yet.” The Aes Sedai shrugged and went back to her note-taking. “Does anyone know where Loial is?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The Ogier?” one of the three by the door said. Dav Ayellin was stockier than Mat, but he had that same twinkle in his dark eyes. He had the same rumpled, uncombed look about him as Mat, too. In the old days, what little mischief Mat did not get up to, Dav did, though Mat usually led the way. “He’s out with the men clearing back the Westwood. You’d think we were cutting down his brother every time we cut a tree, but he clears three to anybody else’s one with that monstrous axe he had Master Luhhan make. If you want him, I saw Jaim Thane running to tell them you had come in. I’ll bet they all come to get a look at you.” Peering at the broken-off arrow, he winced and rubbed his own side in sympathy. “Does it hurt much?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It hurts enough,” Perrin said curtly. Coming to get a look at him. <span class="calibre18">What am I, a gleeman?</span> “What about Luc? I don’t want to see him, but is he here?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I’m afraid not.” The second man, Elam Dowtry, rubbed his long nose. Incongruous with his farmer’s wool coat and his cowlick, he wore a sword at his belt; the hilt had been freshly wrapped in rawhide and the leather scabbard flaked and peeling. “Lord Luc is off hunting the Horn of Valere, I think. Or maybe Trollocs.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Dav and Elam were Perrin’s friends, or had been, companions in hunting and fishing, both his age near enough, but their thrilled grins made
them seem younger. Either Mat or Rand could have passed for five years older at least. Maybe he could, too.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I hope he comes back soon,” Elam went on. “He has been showing me how to use a sword. Did you know he’s a Hunter for the Horn? And a king, if he had his rights. Of Andor, I hear.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Andor has queens,” Perrin muttered absently, meeting Faile’s gaze, “not kings.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“So he is not here,” she said. Gaul shifted slightly; he looked ready to go hunting for Luc, his eyes blue ice. It would not have surprised Perrin to see Bain and Chiad veil themselves on the spot.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“No,” Verin said vaguely, manifestly more intent on her notes than what she was saying. “Not that he hasn’t been a help sometimes, but he does have a way of causing trouble when he is here. Yesterday, before anyone knew what he was doing, he led a delegation out to meet a Whitecloak patrol and told them Emond’s Field was closed to them. He apparently told them not to come within ten miles. I cannot approve of Whitecloaks, but I do not suppose they took that very well. Not wise to antagonize them more than is strictly necessary.” Frowning at what she had written, she rubbed her nose, seemingly unaware of leaving a smudge of ink.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin did not much care how the Whitecloaks took anything. “Yesterday,” he breathed. If Luc had come back to the village yesterday, it was not likely he could have had anything to do with Trollocs being where they were not expected. The more Perrin thought about how that ambush turned around, the more he thought the Trollocs must have been expecting them. And the more he wanted to blame Luc. “Wanting won’t make a stone cheese,” he muttered. “But he still smells like cheese to me.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Dav and the other two looked at each other doubtfully. Perrin supposed he must not seem to be making much sense.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It was a bunch of Coplins, mainly,” the third fellow said in a startlingly deep voice. “Darl and Hari and Dag and Ewal. And Wit Congar. Daise gave him a fit over it.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I heard they all liked the Whitecloaks.” Perrin thought the bass-voiced fellow seemed familiar. He was younger than Elam and Dav by two or three years yet an inch taller, lean-faced but with wide shoulders.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“They did.” The fellow laughed. “You know them. They drift naturally toward anything that makes trouble for somebody else. Since Lord Luc has been talking, they’re all for marching up to Watch Hill and telling the Whitecloaks to get out of the Two Rivers. Anyway, they’re for somebody else marching up there. I think they mean to be well back in the pack.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">If that face had been pudgy, and half a foot or more nearer the ground . . . . “Ewin Finngar!” Perrin exclaimed. It could not be; Ewin was a stout, squeaky little nuisance who tried to crowd in whenever the older fellows got together. This lad would be as big as he was, or bigger, by the time he stopped growing. “Is that you?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Ewin nodded with a broad grin. “We’ve been hearing all about you, Perrin,” he said in that surprising bass, “fighting Trollocs, and having all kinds of adventures out in the world, so they say. I can still call you Perrin, can’t I?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Light, yes!” Perrin barked. He was more than tired of this Goldeneyes business.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I wish I’d gone with you last year.” Dav rubbed his hands together eagerly. “Coming home with Aes Sedai, and Warders, and an Ogier.” He made them sound like trophies. “All I ever do is herd cows and milk cows, herd cows and milk cows. That and hoe, and chop wood. You’ve had all the luck.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What was it like?” Elam put in breathlessly. “Alanna Sedai said you’ve been all the way to the Great Blight, and I hear you’ve seen Caemlyn, and Tear. What’s a city like? Are they really ten times as big as Emond’s Field? Did you see a palace? Are there Darkfriends in the cities? Is the Blight really full of Trollocs and Fades and Warders?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Did a Trolloc give you that scar?” Voice like a bull or not, Ewin managed a sort of squeaky excitement. “I wish I had a scar. Did you see a queen? Or a king? I think I’d rather see a queen, but a king would be grand. What is the White Tower like? Is it as big as a palace?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Faile smiled, amused, but Perrin blinked at the onslaught. Had they forgotten the Trollocs on Winternight, forgotten the Trollocs in the countryside right then? Elam clutched his sword hilt as if he wanted to be off for the Blight on the instant, and Dav was up on his toes, eyes gleaming, and Ewin looked ready to grab Perrin’s collar. Adventure? They were idiots. Yet there were hard times coming, harder than the Two Rivers had seen so far, he was afraid. It could not hurt if they had a little while longer before they learned the truth.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">His side hurt, but he tried to answer. They seemed disappointed he had never seen the White Tower, or a king or a queen. He thought Berelain might suffice for a queen, but with Faile there he was not about to mention her. Some other things he shied away from: Falme, and the Eye of the World, the Forsaken, <span class="calibre18">Callandor.</span> Dangerous subjects, those, leading inevitably to the Dragon Reborn. He could tell them a little of Caemlyn,
though, and Tear, of the Borderlands and the Blight. It was odd what they accepted and what not. The corrupted landscape of the Blight, seeming to rot while you looked at it, they ate up, and top-knotted Shienaran soldiers, and Ogier <span class="calibre18">stedding</span> where Aes Sedai could not wield the Power and Fades were reluctant to enter. But the size of the Stone of Tear, or the immensity of cities . . . .</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">About his own supposed adventures, he said, “Mainly I’ve just tried to keep from having my head split open. That’s what adventures are, that and finding a place to sleep for the night, and something to eat. You go hungry a lot having adventures, and sleep cold or wet or both.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">They did not like that very much, or appear to believe it any more than they believed that the Stone was as big as a small mountain. He reminded himself that he had known as little of the world before he left the Two Rivers. It did not help much. He had never been this wide-eyed. Had he? The common room seemed to be hot. He would have taken his coat off, but moving seemed too much effort.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What about Rand and Mat?” Ewin demanded. “If it’s all being hungry and getting rained on, why didn’t they come home, too?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Tam and Abell had come in, Tam with a sword belted on over his coat and both men with bows—oddly, the sword looked right on Tam, farm coat or no—so he told it much as he had before, Mat gambling and carousing in taverns and chasing girls, and Rand in his fine coat with a pretty, yellow-haired girl on his arm. He made Elayne a lady, expecting they would never believe the Daughter-Heir of Andor, and was proved right when they expressed incredulity. Still, it all seemed satisfactory, the kind of thing they wanted to hear, and disbelief faded a bit when Elam pointed out that Faile was a lady and seemed to be dancing attendance on Perrin pretty sharp. That made Perrin grin; he wondered what they would say if he told them she was cousin to a queen.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Faile no longer appeared to be amused for some reason. She turned on them with a stare to match Elayne’s haughtiest, stiff-backed and frosty-faced. “You have badgered him enough. He is wounded. Off with you, now.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">For a wonder, they bowed clumsily—Dav made an awkward leg, looking a complete fool—and murmured hasty apologies—to her, not him!—and turned to go. Their departure was delayed by the arrival of Loial, stooping through the doorway with his shaggy hair brushing the transom. They stared at the Ogier almost as if seeing him for the first time—then glanced at Faile and hurried on their way. That cold, lady’s stare of hers did work.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">When Loial straightened, his head came just short of the ceiling. His
capacious coat pockets bore the usual squared bulges of books, but he carried a huge axe. Its haft stood as tall as he did, and its head, shaped like a wood-axe, was at least as big as Perrin’s battle-axe. “You are hurt,” he boomed as soon as his eyes fell on Perrin. “They told me you had returned, but they did not say you were hurt, or I would have come faster.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The axe gave Perrin a start. Among Ogier, “putting a long handle on your axe” meant being hasty, or angry—Ogier seemed to see the two as much the same thing for some reason. Loial did look angry, tufted ears drawing back, frowning so his dangling eyebrows hung down on his broad cheeks. At having to cut trees, no doubt. Perrin wanted to get him alone and find out if he had seen anything more concerning Alanna’s doings. Or Verin’s. He rubbed his face and was surprised to find it dry; he felt as if he should be sweating.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He is also stubborn,” Faile said, turning on Perrin with the same commanding look she had used on Dav and Elam and Ewin. “You should be in a bed. Where is Alanna, Verin? If she is to Heal him, where is she?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“She will come.” The Aes Sedai did not look up. She was back into her little book again, frowning thoughtfully, pen poised.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He should still be in a bed!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I will have time for that later,” Perrin said firmly. He smiled at her to soften it, but all that did was make her look worried and mutter “stubborn” under her breath. He could not ask Loial about the Aes Sedai in front of Verin, but there was something else at least as important. “Loial, the Waygate is unlocked, and Trollocs coming through. How can that be?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Ogier’s brows sank even deeper, and his ears wilted. “My fault, Perrin,” he rumbled mournfully. “I put both <span class="calibre18">Avendesora</span> leaves on the outside. That locked the Waygate on the inside, but from the outside, anyone could still open it. The Ways have been dark for long generations, yet we grew them. I could not bring myself to destroy the Gate. I am sorry, Perrin. It is all my fault.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I did not believe a Waygate <span class="calibre18">could</span> be destroyed,” Faile said.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I did not mean destroy, exactly.” Loial leaned on his long-handled axe. “A Waygate was destroyed once, less than five hundred years after the Breaking, according to Damelle, daughter of Ala daughter of Soferra, because the Gate was near a <span class="calibre18">stedding</span> that had fallen to the Blight. There are two or three Gates lost in the Blight as it is. But she wrote that it was very difficult, and required thirteen Aes Sedai working together with a <span class="calibre18">sa’angreal.</span> Another attempt she wrote of, by only nine, during the Trolloc Wars, damaged the Gate in such a way that the Aes Sedai were pulled
into—” He cut off, ears wriggling with embarrassment, and knuckled his wide nose. Everyone was staring at him, even Verin and the Aiel. “I do let myself be carried away, sometimes. The Waygate. Yes. I cannot destroy it, but if I remove both <span class="calibre18">Avendesora</span> leaves completely, they will die.” He grimaced at the thought. “The only means of opening the Gate again will be for the Elders to bring the Talisman of Growing. Though I suppose an Aes Sedai could cut a hole in it.” This time he shuddered. Damaging a Waygate must have seemed like tearing up a book to him. A moment later, he was grim-faced once more. “I will go now.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“No!” Perrin said sharply. The arrowhead seemed to throb, but it did not really hurt anymore. He was talking too much; his throat was dry. “There are Trollocs up there, Loial. They can fit an Ogier into a cookpot as well as a human.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“But, Perrin, I—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“No, Loial. How are you going to write your book if you go off and get yourself killed?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Loial’s ears twitched. “It is my responsibility, Perrin.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The responsibility is mine,” Perrin said gently. “You told me what you were doing with the Waygate, and I didn’t suggest anything different. Besides, the way you jump every time your mother is mentioned, I don’t want her coming after me. I will go, as soon as Alanna Heals this arrow out of me.” He wiped his forehead, then frowned at his hand. Still no sweat. “Can I have a drink of water?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Faile was there in an instant, her cool fingers where his hand had been. “He is burning up! Verin, we cannot wait for Alanna. You must—!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I am here,” the dark Aes Sedai announced, appearing from the door at the back of the common room, Marin al’Vere and Alsbet Luhhan at her heels, and Ihvon right behind them. Perrin felt the tingle of the Power before Alanna’s hand replaced Faile’s, and she added in a cool, serene voice, “Carry him into the kitchen. The table there is large enough to lay him out. Quickly. There is not much time.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin’s head spun, and abruptly he realized Loial had leaned his axe beside the door and picked him up, cradling him in his arms. “The Waygate is mine, Loial.” <span class="calibre18">Light, I’m thirsty.</span> “My responsibility.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The arrowhead truly did not seem to hurt as much as it had, but he ached all over. Loial was carrying him somewhere, bending through doorways. There was Mistress Luhhan, biting her lip, eyes squinched as if about to cry. He wondered why. She never cried. Mistress al’Vere looked worried, too.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Mistress Luhhan,” he murmured, “Mother says I can come be apprenticed to Master Luhhan.” No. That was a long time ago. That was . . . . What was? He could not seem to remember.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He was lying on something hard, listening to Alanna speak. “ . . . barbs are caught on bone as well as flesh, and the arrowhead has twisted. I must realign it with the first wound and pull it out. If the shock does not kill him, I can then Heal the damage I have done as well as the rest. There is no other way. He is near the brink now.” Nothing to do with him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Faile smiled down at him tremulously, her face upside down. Had he really once thought her mouth was too wide? It was just right. He wanted to touch her cheek, but Mistress al’Vere and Mistress Luhhan were holding his wrists for some reason, leaning with all their weight. Someone was lying across his legs, too, and Loial’s big hands swallowed his shoulders, pressing them flat to the table. Table. Yes. The kitchen table.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Bite down, my heart,” Faile said from far away. “It will hurt.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He wanted to ask her what would hurt, but she was pressing a leather-wrapped stick into his mouth. He smelled the leather and the spicewood and her. Would she come hunting with him, running across the endless grassy plains after endless herds of deer? Icy cold shivered through him; vaguely he recognized the feel of the One Power. And then there was pain. He heard the stick snap between his teeth before blackness covered everything.</span></div>
