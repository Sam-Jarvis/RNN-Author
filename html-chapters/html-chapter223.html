<div class="subtitle-chapter"><span class="calibre2"><span class="calibre18">Hard Heads</span></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">E</span>layne was not certain Rand realized she was still in the room, the way he stared after Egwene with a half-bewildered expression. Now and again he shook his head as if arguing with himself, or trying to straighten his mind. She was content to wait him out. Anything that put off the moment a while longer. She concentrated on maintaining an outward composure, back straight and head high, hands folded in her lap, a calmness on her face that could have rivaled Moiraine’s best. Butterflies the size of hedgehogs frolicked in her stomach.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">It was not fear of him channeling. She had let go of <span class="calibre18">saidar</span> as soon as Egwene stood to leave. She wanted to trust him, and she had to. It was what she wanted to happen that had her trembling inside. She had to concentrate not to finger her necklace or fiddle with the strand of sapphires in her hair. Was her perfume too heavy? No. Egwene said he liked the smell of roses. The dress. She wanted to tug it up, but . . . .</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He turned—the slight limp in his step tightened her lips thoughtfully—saw her sitting in her chair, and gave a start, eyes widening with what seemed very close to panic. She was glad to see it; the effort of keeping her own face serene had leaped tenfold as soon as his eyes touched her. Those eyes were blue now, like a misty morning sky.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He recovered on the instant and made a quite unnecessary bow, wiping his hands once nervously on his coat. “I did not realize you were still—”
Flushing, he cut off; forgetting her presence might be taken as an insult. “I mean . . . I didn’t . . . that is, I . . . .” He took a deep breath and began again. “I am not as much of a fool as I sound, my Lady. It isn’t every day someone tells you they don’t love you, my Lady.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She put on a tone of mock severity. “If you call me that again, I shall call you my Lord Dragon. And curtsy. Even the Queen of Andor might curtsy to you, and I am only Daughter-Heir.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Light! Don’t do that.” He seemed uneasy out of all proportion to the threat.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I will not, Rand,” she said in a more serious voice, “if you call me by my name. Elayne. Say it.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Elayne.” He spoke awkwardly, yet, delightfully, as if he were savoring the name, too.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Good.” It was absurd to be so pleased; all he had done was say her name, after all. There was something she had to know before she could go on. “Did it hurt you very much?” That could be taken two ways, she realized. “What Egwene told you, I mean.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“No. Yes. Some. I don’t know. Fair is fair, after all.” His small grin took some of the edge off of his wariness. “I sound a fool again, don’t I?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“No. Not to me.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I told her the pure truth, but I don’t think she believed me. I suppose I did not want to believe it of her, either. Not really. If that isn’t foolish, I don’t know what is.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“If you tell me one more time that you are a fool, I may begin to believe it.” <span class="calibre18">He won’t try to hold on to her; I won’t have to deal with that</span>. Her voice was calm, with a light enough tone to let him know she did not really mean what she said. “I saw a Cairhienin lord’s fool, once, a man in a funny striped coat, too big for him and sewn with bells. You would look silly wearing bells.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I suppose I would,” he said ruefully. “I will remember that.” His slow grin was wider this time, warming his whole face.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The butterflies’ wings flogged her for haste, but she occupied herself with straightening her skirts. She had to go slowly, carefully. <span class="calibre18">If I don’t, he’ll think I am just a foolish girl. And he will be right</span>. The butterflies in her belly were beating kettle drums, now.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Would you like a flower?” he asked suddenly, and she blinked in confusion.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“A flower?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Yes.” Striding to the bed, he scooped up a double handful of feathers
from the tattered mattress and held them out to her. “I made one for the majhere last night. You’d have thought I had given her the Stone. But yours will be much prettier,” he added hastily. “Much prettier. I promise.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Rand, I—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I will be careful. It takes only a trickle of the Power. Just a thread, and I will be very careful.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Trust. She had to trust him. It was a small surprise to realize that she did. “I would like that, Rand.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">For long moments he stared at the fluffy mound in his hands, a slow frown on his face. Abruptly he let the feathers fall, dusting his hands. “Flowers,” he said. “That’s no fit gift for you.” Her heart went out to him; clearly he had tried to embrace <span class="calibre18">saidin</span> and failed. Masking disappointment in action, he limped hurriedly to the metallic cloth and began gathering it over his arm. “Now this is a proper gift for the Daughter-Heir of Andor. You could have a seamstress make . . . .” He floundered over what a seamstress might make from a four-pace length of gold-and-silver cloth, less than two feet wide.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I am sure a seamstress will have many ideas,” she told him diplomatically. Pulling a handkerchief from her sleeve, she knelt for a moment to collect the feathers he had dropped into the square of pale blue silk.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The maids will take care of that,” he said as she tucked the small bundle securely into her belt pouch.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Well, this bit is done.” How could he understand that she would keep the feathers because he had wanted them to be a flower? He shifted his feet, holding the glittering folds as if he did not know what to do with them. “The majhere must have seamstresses,” she told him. “I will give that to one of them.” He brightened, smiling; she saw no reason to tell him she meant it as a gift. Those thundering butterflies would not let her hold back any longer. “Rand, do you . . . like me?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Like you?” he frowned. “Of course, I like you. I like you very much.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Did he have to look as if he did not understand at all? “I am fond of you, Rand.” She was startled that she said it so calmly; her stomach seemed to be trying to writhe up into her throat, and her hands and feet felt like ice. “More than fond.” That was enough; she was not going to make a fool of herself. <span class="calibre18">He has to say more than “like,” first</span>. She almost giggled hysterically. <span class="calibre18">I will keep control of myself. I will not let him see me behave like a moon-eyed girl. I will not</span>.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I am fond of you,” he said slowly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I am not usually so forward.” No; that might make him think of
Berelain. There was red in his cheeks; he <span class="calibre18">was</span> thinking of Berelain. Burn him! Her voice came as smooth as silk. “Soon I will have to go, Rand. To leave Tear. I may not see you again for months.” <span class="calibre18">Or ever</span>, a tiny voice cried in her head. She refused to listen. “I could not go without letting you know how I feel. And I am . . . very fond of you.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Elayne, I <span class="calibre18">am</span> fond of you. I feel . . . . I want . . . .” The scarlet spots on his cheeks grew. “Elayne, I don’t know what to say, how to . . . .”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Suddenly it was her face that was flaming. He must think she was trying to force him into saying more. <span class="calibre18">Aren’t you</span>? the small voice mocked, which only made her cheeks hotter. “Rand, I am not asking for . . . .” Light! How to say it? “I only wanted you to know how I feel. That is all.” Berelain would not have let it go at that. Berelain would have been wrapped around him by now. Telling herself she would not let that half-dressed snip better her, she moved closer to him, took the glittering cloth from his arm, and dropped it on the carpet. For some reason he seemed taller than he ever had before. “Rand . . . . Rand, I want you to kiss me.” There. It was out.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Kiss you?” he said as if he had never heard of kissing before. “Elayne, I don’t want to promise more than . . . . I mean, it isn’t as if we were betrothed. Not that I am suggesting we should be. It’s just that . . . . I <span class="calibre18">am</span> fond of you, Elayne. More than fond. I just do not want you to think I . . . .”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She had to laugh at him, with all his confused earnestness. “I do not know how things are done in the Two Rivers, but in Caemlyn you don’t wait until you are betrothed before kissing a girl. And it does not mean you must become betrothed, either. But perhaps you do not know how—” His arms went around her almost roughly, and his lips came down on hers. Her head spun; her toes tried to curl up in her slippers. Some time later—she was not certain how long—she realized she was leaning against his chest, knees trembling, trying to gulp air.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Forgive me for interrupting you,” he said. She was glad to hear a touch of breathlessness in his voice. “I am just a backward shepherd from the Two Rivers.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You are uncouth,” she murmured against his shirt, “and you did not shave this morning, but I would not say you are backward.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Elayne, I—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She put a hand over his mouth. “I do not want to hear anything from you that you do not mean with your whole heart,” she said firmly. “Not now, or ever.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He nodded, not as if he understood why, but at least as if he understood that she meant what she said. Straightening her hair—the strand of
sapphires was tangled beyond mending without a mirror—she stepped out of his encircling arms, not without reluctance; it would be all too easy to remain there, and she had already been more forward than she had ever dreamed of before. Speaking up like that; asking for a kiss. Asking! She was not Berelain.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Berelain. Perhaps Min had had a viewing. What Min saw, happened, but she would not share him with Berelain. Perhaps she needed to do a bit more plain speaking. Obliquely plain, at least. “I expect you will not lack for company after I go. Just remember that some women see a man with their hearts, while others see no more than a bauble to wear, no different than a necklace or a bracelet. Remember that I will come back, and I am one who sees with her heart.” He looked confused, at first, then a little alarmed. She had said too much, too fast. She had to divert him. “Do you know what you have not said to me? You have not tried to frighten me away by telling me how dangerous you are. Don’t try now. It is too late.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I did not think of it.” Another thought came to him, though, and his eyes crinkled with suspicion. “Did you and Egwene scheme this up between you?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She managed to combine wide-eyed innocence with mild outrage. “How could you even consider such a thing? Do you imagine we would hand you around between us like a package? You think a good deal of yourself. There is such a thing as being overproud.” He did look confused, now. Quite satisfactory. “Are you sorry for what you did to us, Rand?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I did not mean to frighten you,” he said hesitantly. “Egwene made me angry; she’s always been able to without half trying. That’s no excuse, I know. I said I was sorry, and I am. Look what it got me. Burned tables and another mattress ruined.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“And for . . . the pinch?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">His face reddened again, but he faced her firmly even so. “No. No, I am not sorry for that. The two of you, talking over my head, as if I were a lump of wood with no ears. You deserved as much, both of you, and I won’t say different.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">For a moment she considered him. He rubbed his arms through his coat sleeves as she momentarily embraced <span class="calibre18">saidar</span>. She did not know Healing to any degree, but she had learned bits and pieces on the edge of it. Channeling, she soothed away the hurt she had given him for the pinch. His eyes widened in surprise, and he shifted on his feet as if testing the absence of pain. “For being honest,” she told him simply.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">There was a rap at the door, and Gaul looked in. At first the Aielman
had his head down, but after a quick glance at them he raised it. Color flooded Elayne’s face as she realized he had suspected that he might be interrupting something he should not see. She very nearly embraced <span class="calibre18">saidar</span> again and taught him a lesson.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The Tairens are here,” Gaul said. “The High Lords you were expecting.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I will go, then,” she told Rand. “You must tell them about—taxes, was it not? Think on what I have said.” She did not say “think of me,” but she was sure the effect would be the same.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He reached out as if to stop her, but she slipped away from him. She had no intention of putting on a display in front of Gaul. The man was Aiel, but what must he think of her, wearing perfume and sapphires at that hour of the morning? It required real effort not to pull the neckline of her dress up higher.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The High Lords entered as she reached the door, a cluster of graying men in pointed beards and colorful, ornate coats with puffy sleeves. They crowded out of her way with reluctant bows, their bland faces and polite murmurs not hiding their relief that she was leaving.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She glanced back once from the doorway. A tall, broad-shouldered young man in a plain green coat among the High Lords in their silks and satin stripes, Rand looked like a stork among peacocks, yet there was something about him, a presence that said he commanded there by right. The Tairens recognized it, bending their stiff necks reluctantly. He thought probably they bowed just because he was the Dragon Reborn, and perhaps they thought so, too. But she had seen men, like Gareth Bryne, the Captain-Commander of her mother’s Guards, who could have dominated a room in rags, with no title and no one knowing their name. Rand might not know it, but he was such a man. He had not been when she first saw him, but he was now. She pulled the door shut behind her.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Aiel around the entrance glanced at her, and the captain commanding the ring of Defenders in the middle of the anteroom stared uneasily, but she barely noticed them. It was done. Or at least it was begun. Four days she had before Joiya and Amico were put on that ship, four days at most to twine herself so firmly into Rand’s thoughts that he had no room for Berelain. Or if not that, firmly enough that she stayed inside his head until she had the chance to do more. She had never thought she might do a thing like this, stalk a man like a huntress stalking a wild boar. The butterflies were still gamboling in her stomach. At least she had not let him see how nervous she was. And it occurred to her that she had not once thought of what her mother would say. With that, the flutterings vanished.
She did not care what her mother said. Morgase had to accept her daughter as a woman; that was all there was to it.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Aiel bowed as she moved away, and she acknowledged them with a gracious nod that would have done Morgase proud. Even the Tairen captain looked at her as if he could see her new serenity. She did not think she would be troubled by butterflies again. For the Black Ajah perhaps, but not for Rand.</span></div>
<div class="p-blanc"><span class="calibre22"> <br class="calibre8"/></span></div>
<div class="p-blanc"><span class="calibre22"> <br class="calibre8"/></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="calibre22">Ignoring the High Lords in their anxious semicircle, Rand watched the door close behind Elayne with wonder in his eyes. Dreams coming true, even only this much, made him uneasy. A swim in the Waterwood was one thing, but he would never have believed a dream where she came to him like this. She had been so cool and collected, while he was tripping over his own tongue. And Egwene, giving his own thoughts back to him and only concerned she might hurt him. Why was it women could go to pieces or fly into a rage at the smallest thing, yet never flicker an eyelash at what left you gaping?</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“My Lord Dragon?” Sunamon murmured even more diffidently than usual. Word of this morning must have spread through the Stone already; that first lot had nearly run on their way out, and it was doubtful Torean would show his face, or his filthy suggestions, anywhere Rand was.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Sunamon essayed an ingratiating smile, then smothered it, drywashing his plump hands, when Rand only looked at him. The rest pretended they did not see the burned tables, or the shattered mattress and scattered books, or the half-melted lumps over the fireplace that had been the stag and wolves. High Lords were good at seeing only what they wanted to see. Carleon and Tedosian, false self-effacement in every line of their thick bodies, surely never realized there was anything suspicious in never looking at one another. But then, Rand might never have noticed if not for Thom’s note, found in the pocket of a coat just back from being brushed.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The Lord Dragon wished to see us?” Sunamon managed.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Could Egwene and Elayne have worked it up between them? Of course not. Women did not do things like that any more than men. Did they? It had to be coincidence. Elayne heard that he was free and decided to speak. That was it. “Taxes,” he barked. The Tairens did not move, but they gave the impression of stepping back. How he hated dealing with these men; he wanted to dive back into the books.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It is a bad precedent, my Lord Dragon, lowering taxes,” a lean, gray-haired
man said in an oily voice. Meilan was tall for a Tairen, only a hand shorter than Rand, and hard as any Defender. He held himself in a stoop in Rand’s presence; his dark eyes showed how he hated it. But he had hated it when Rand told them to stop crouching around him, too. None of them straightened, but Meilan especially had not liked being reminded of what he did. “The peasants have always paid easily, but if we lower their taxes, when the day comes that we raise them back to where they now are, the fools will complain as bitterly as if we had doubled the present levy. There might well be riots when that day comes, my Lord Dragon.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand strode across the room to stand before <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>; the crystal sword glittered, outshining the gilt and gemstones surrounding it. A reminder of who he was, of the power he could wield. Egwene. It was foolish to feel hurt because she said she no longer loved him. Why should he expect her to have feelings for him that he did not have for her? Yet it did hurt. A relief, but not a pleasant one. “You will have riots if you drive men off their farms.” Three books stood in a stack almost by Meilan’s feet. <span class="calibre18">The Treasures of the Stone of Tear, Travels in the Waste</span>, and <span class="calibre18">Dealings with the Territory of Mayene</span>. The keys lay in those, and in the various translations of <span class="calibre18">The Karaethon Cycle</span>, if he could only find them and fit them to the proper locks. He pushed his mind back to the High Lords. “Do you think they will watch their families starve and do nothing?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The Defenders of the Stone have put down riots before, my Lord Dragon,” Sunamon said soothingly. “Our own guards can keep peace in the countryside. The peasants will not disturb you, I give you my assurance.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“There are too many farmers as it is.” Carleon flinched at Rand’s glare. “It is the civil war in Cairhien, my Lord Dragon,” he explained hurriedly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The Cairhienin can buy no grain, and the granaries are bursting. This year’s harvest will go to waste as it is. And next year . . . ? Burn my soul, my Lord Dragon, but what we need is for some of those peasants to stop their eternal digging and planting.” He seemed to realize he had said too much, though he clearly did not understand why. Rand wondered whether he had any idea how food got to his table. Did he see anything but gold, and power?</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What will you do when Cairhien is buying grain again?” Rand said coolly. “For that matter, is Cairhien the only land that needs grain?” Why <span class="calibre18">had</span> Elayne spoken up like that? What <span class="calibre18">did</span> she expect of him? Fond, she said. Women could play games with words like Aes Sedai. Did she mean she loved him? No, that was plain foolishness. Overproud to a degree.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“My Lord Dragon,” Meilan said, half subservient, half as if explaining something to a child, “if the civil wars stopped today, Cairhien still could not buy more than a few bargeloads for two, even three years. We have always sold our grain to Cairhien.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Always—for the twenty years since the Aiel War. They were so bound up in what they had <span class="calibre18">always</span> done that they could not see what was so simple. Or would not see it. When the cabbages sprouted like weeds around Emond’s Field, it was a near certainty that bad rain or whiteworm had struck Deven Ride or Watch Hill. When Watch Hill had too many turnips, Emond’s Field would have a shortage, or Deven Ride.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Offer it in Illian,” he told them. What did Elayne expect? “Or Al-tara.” He did like her, but he liked Min as much. Or thought he did. It was impossible to sort out his feelings for either of them. “You have ships for the sea as well as riverboats and barges, and if you don’t have enough, hire them from Mayene.” He liked both women, but beyond that . . . . He had spent very nearly his whole life mooning after Egwene; he was not about to dive into that again until he was sure. Sure of something. Sure. If <span class="calibre18">Dealings with the Territory of Mayene</span> was to be believed . . . . <span class="calibre18">Stop this</span>, he told himself. <span class="calibre18">Keep your mind on these weasels, or they’ll find cracks to slip through, and bite you on the way</span>. “Pay with grain; I’m sure the First will be amenable, for a good price. And maybe a signed agreement, a treaty . . . .” That was a good word; the sort they used. “ . . . pledging to leave Mayene alone in return for ships.” He owed her that.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We trade little with Illian, my Lord Dragon. They are vultures, and scum.” Tedosian sounded scandalized, and so did Meilan when he said, “We have always dealt with Mayene from strength, my Lord Dragon. Never with bent knee.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand took a deep breath. The High Lords tensed. It always came to this. He always tried to reason with them, and it always failed. Thom said the High Lords had heads as hard as the Stone, and he was right. <span class="calibre18">What do I feel for her? Dreaming about her. She’s certainly pretty</span>. He was not sure if he meant Elayne or Min. <span class="calibre18">Stop this! A kiss means no more than a kiss. Stop it!</span> Putting women firmly out of his head, he set himself to telling these stone-brained fools what they were going to do. “First, you will cut taxes on farmers by three-quarters, and on everyone else by half. Don’t argue! Just do it! Second, you go to Berelain and ask—ask!—her price for hiring . . . .”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The High Lords listened with false smiles and grinding teeth, but they listened.</span></div>

<div class="p-blanc"><span class="calibre22"> <br class="calibre8"/></span></div>
<div class="p-blanc"><span class="calibre22"> <br class="calibre8"/></span></div>

<div class="p"><span class="calibre22">Egwene was considering Joiya and Amico when Mat fell in beside her, just walking down the hallway as if he merely happened to be going the same way. He was frowning to himself, and his hair needed brushing, as if he had been scrubbing his fingers through it. Once or twice he glanced at her but did not speak. The servants they passed bowed or curtsied, and so did the occasional High Lords and Ladies, if with markedly less enthusiasm. Mat’s lip-curling stares at the nobles would have brought trouble if she had not been there, friend of the Lord Dragon or not.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">This silence was not like him, not like the Mat she knew. Except for his fine red coat—wrinkled as if he had slept in it—he seemed no different than the old Mat, yet they were surely all different now. His quiet was unsettling. “Is last night troubling you?” she asked at last.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He missed a step. “You know about that? Well, you would, wouldn’t you. Doesn’t bother me. Wasn’t much to it. Over and done with now, anyway.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She pretended to believe him. “Nynaeve and I do not see much of you.” That was a rank understatement.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I have been busy,” he muttered with an uncomfortable shrug, looking everywhere but at her again.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Dicing?” she asked dismissively.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Cards.” A plump maid, curtsying with her arms full of folded towels, glanced at Egwene and, apparently thinking she was not looking, winked at Mat. He grinned at her. “I’ve been busy playing cards.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene’s eyebrows rose sharply. That woman had to be ten years older than Nynaeve. “I see. It must use up a great deal of time. Playing cards. Too much to spare a few moments for old friends.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The last time I spared you a moment, you and Nynaeve tied me up with the Power like a pig for market so you could rummage through my room. Friends don’t steal from friends.” He grimaced. “Besides, you’re always with that Elayne, with her nose in the air. Or Moiraine. I do not like—” Clearing his throat, he shot her a sideways glance. “I don’t like taking up your time. You are busy, from what I hear. Questioning Darkfriends. Doing all sorts of important things, I should imagine. You know these Tairens think you are Aes Sedai, don’t you?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She shook her head ruefully. It was Aes Sedai he did not like. However much of the world Mat saw, nothing would ever change him. “It is not stealing to take back what was supposed to be a loan,” she told him.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I don’t remember you saying anything about a loan. Aaah, what use do I have for a letter from the Amyrlin? Just get me in trouble. You could have asked, though.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She refrained from pointing out that they had asked. She wanted neither an argument nor a sulky departure. He would not call it that, of course. This time she would let him get away with his version. “Well, I am glad you are still willing to talk to me. Was there a special reason for it today?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He shoved his fingers through his hair and muttered to himself. What he needed was his mother to haul him off by his ear for a long talking to. Egwene counseled herself to patience. She could be patient when she wanted to. She would not say a word before he did, if she burst for it.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The corridor opened into a railed colonnade of white marble, looking down on one of the Stone’s few gardens. Large white blossoms covered a few small, waxy-leafed trees and gave a scent even sweeter than the banks of red and yellow roses. A sullen breeze failed to stir the hangings on the inner wall, but it did cut the morning’s growing damp warmth. Mat took a seat on the wide balustrade with his back against a column and one foot up in front of him. Peering down into the garden, he finally said, “I . . . need some advice.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He wanted advice from <span class="calibre18">her</span>? She goggled at him. “Whatever I can do to help,” she said faintly. He turned his head to her, and she did her best to assume something like Aes Sedai calm. “What do you want advice about?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I don’t know.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">It was a ten-pace drop to the garden. Besides, there were men down there weeding among the roses. If she pushed him over, he might land on one. A gardener, not a rosebush. “How am I supposed to advise you, then?” she asked in a thin voice.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I am . . . trying to decide what to do.” He looked embarrassed; he had a right to, in her opinion.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I hope you are not thinking of trying to leave. You know how important you are. You cannot run away from it, Mat.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You think I don’t know that? I don’t think I could leave if Moiraine told me I could. Believe me, Egwene, I am not going anywhere. I just want to know what’s going to happen.” He gave a rough shake of his head, and his voice grew tighter. “What comes next? What’s in these holes in my memory? There are chunks of my life that aren’t even there; they don’t exist, as if they never happened! Why do I find myself spouting gibberish?
People say it’s the Old Tongue, but it’s goose gabble to me. I want to know, Egwene. I have to know, before I go as crazy as Rand.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Rand is not crazy,” she said automatically. So Mat was not trying to run away. That was a pleasant surprise; he had not seemed to believe in responsibility. But there was pain and worry in his voice. Mat never worried, or never let anyone see it if he did. “I do not know the answers, Mat,” she said gently. “Perhaps Moiraine—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“No!” He was on his feet in a bound. “No Aes Sedai! I mean . . . . You’re different. I know you, and you aren’t . . . . Didn’t they teach you anything in the Tower, some trick or other, something that would serve?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Oh, Mat, I am sorry. I am so sorry.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">His laugh reminded her of their childhood. Just so he had always laughed when his grandest expectations went astray. “Ah, well, I guess it does not matter. It’d still be the Tower, if at second hand. No offense to you.” Just so he had moaned over a splinter in his finger and treated a broken leg as if it were nothing at all.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“There might be a way,” she said slowly. “If Moiraine says it is all right. She might.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Moiraine! Haven’t you heard a word I said? The last thing I want is Moiraine meddling. What way?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Mat had always been rash. But he wanted no more than she did, to know. If only he showed a little sense and caution for once. A passing Tairen noblewoman with dark braids coiled about her head, shoulders bare above yellow linen, bent her knee slightly, looking at them with no expression; she walked on quickly, with a stiff back. Egwene watched her until she was well beyond earshot, and they were alone. Unless the gardeners, thirty feet below, counted. Mat was staring at her expectantly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">In the end, she told him of the <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal</span>, the twisted doorway that held answers on its other side. It was the dangers she emphasized, the consequences of foolish questions, or those touching the Shadow, the dangers even Aes Sedai might not know. She was more than flattered that he had come to her, but he had to show a little sense. “You must remember this, Mat. Frivolous questions can get you killed, so if you do use it, you will have to be serious for a change. And you mustn’t ask any questions that touch the Shadow.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He had listened with greater and greater incredulity. When she was done, he exclaimed, “Three questions? You go in like Bili, I suppose, spend a night and come out ten years later with a purse that’s always full of gold and a—”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“For once in your life, Matrim Cauthon,” she snapped, “do not talk like a fool. You know very well <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal</span> are not stories. It’s the dangers you have to be aware of. Maybe the answers you seek are inside this one, but you must not try it before Moiraine says you can. You must promise me that, or I promise you I will take you to her like a trout on a string. You know I can.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He gave a loud snort. “I’d be a fool if I did try it, no matter what Moiraine says. Walk into a bloody <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal</span>? It’s less I want to do with the bloody Power, not more. You can blot it right out of your mind.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It is the only chance I know, Mat.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Not for me, it isn’t,” he said firmly. “No chance at all is better than that.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Despite his tone, she wanted to put an arm around him. Only he would likely make some joke at her expense, and try to goose her. He had been incorrigible from the day he was born. But he had come to her for help. “I’m sorry, Mat. What will you do?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Oh, play cards, I suppose. If anyone will play with me. Play stones with Thom. Dice in the taverns. I can still go as far as the city, at least.” His gaze strayed toward a passing maidservant, a slender, dark-eyed girl, near his own age. “I’ll find something to take up time.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Her hand itched to slap him, but instead she said cautiously, “Mat, you really aren’t thinking of leaving, are you?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Would you tell Moiraine, if I was?” He put up his hands to forestall her. “Well, there’s no need. I told you I wouldn’t. I’ll not pretend I’d not like to, but I won’t. Is that good enough for you?” A pensive frown crept onto his face. “Egwene, do you ever wish you were back home? That none of this had ever happened?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">It was a startling question, coming from him, but she knew her answer. “No. Even with everything, no. Do you?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I would be a fool then, wouldn’t I?” he laughed. “It’s cities I like, and this one will do for now. This one will do. Egwene, you won’t tell Moiraine about this, will you? About me asking for advice and all?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Why shouldn’t I?” she asked suspiciously. He was Mat, after all.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He gave an embarrassed hitch of his shoulders. “I’ve been keeping wider of her than I have of . . . . Anyway, I’ve been staying clear, especially when she wants to root around in my head. She might think I’m weakening. You won’t tell her, will you?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I won’t,” she said, “if you promise me you will not go near that <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal</span> without asking her permission. I shouldn’t even have told you about it.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I promise.” He grinned. “I won’t go near that thing unless my life depends on it. I swear.” He finished with mock solemnity.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene shook her head. However much everything else changed, Mat just never would.</span></div>
