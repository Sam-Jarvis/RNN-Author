<p class="ct"><span class="epub-i">To Ignore the Omens</span></p>
<p class="tni">Fortuona, Empress of the Seanchan Empire, studied her husband as he gave orders to their forces. They were arrayed outside the palace in Ebou Dar, and she herself sat upon an elaborate mobile throne, outfitted with poles at the bottom so she could be carried by a dozen soldiers.</p>
<p class="tx">The throne lent her grandeur, but also gave an illusion of immobility. An assassin would assume that she could not move quickly while wearing her formal silks, her gown draping down in front and tumbling toward the ground. They would be surprised, then, that she could break free of the outer garments at the flick of a wrist.</p>
<p class="tx">“He has changed, Greatest One,” Beslan said to her. “And yet he hasn’t. I don’t know what to make of him any longer.”</p>
<p class="tx">“He is what the Wheel has sent us,” Fortuona replied. “Have you considered what you will do?”</p>
<p class="tx">Beslan kept eyes forward. He was impetuous, often governed by his emotions, but no more so than the other Altarans. They were a passionate people, and were making a fine addition to the Empire now that they were properly tamed.</p>
<p class="tx">“I will do as has been suggested,” Beslan said, face flushed.</p>
<p class="tx">“Wise,” Fortuona said.</p>
<p class="tx">“May the throne stand forever,” Beslan said. “And may your breath continue as long, Greatest One.” He bowed, withdrawing to do as he should. Fortuona could march to war, but these were Beslan’s lands to govern. He so wanted to be part of the battle, but now he understood that he was needed here.</p>
<p class="tx">Selucia watched him go, nodding in approval. <span class="epub-i1">That one is becoming a strong asset as he learns proper restraint,</span> she signed.</p>
<p class="tx">Fortuona said nothing. Selucia’s motions carried an implication, one that Fortuona would have missed save for their long association. Beslan <span class="epub-i1">was</span> learning. Other men, however … </p>
<p class="tx">Matrim started cursing up a storm nearby, gathered with the Seanchan commanders. She could not hear exactly what had set him off. What had she done, in yoking herself to him?</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">I have followed the omens,</span> she thought.</p>
<p class="tx">She caught him glancing toward her before he returned to his raving. He <span class="epub-i1">would</span> have to be taught restraint, but teaching him … it would be difficult. Far more difficult than teaching Beslan had been. At least Selucia did not speak her condemnations out loud. The woman was now Fortuona’s Truthspeaker, though Fortuona could sense that Selucia was finding the position grating. She would prefer to remain only Fortuona’s Voice. Perhaps the omens would show Fortuona someone else fitting as a Truthspeaker.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Are we really going to do as he says?</span> Selucia signed.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">This world is chaos,</span> Fortuona signed back. Not a straight answer. She did not want to give straight answers at the moment. Selucia would puzzle out the meaning.</p>
<p class="tx">The Seanchan commonly said “may she live forever” in regard to the Empress. To some, it was a platitude or a mere ritual of allegiance. Fortuona had always seen much more to it. That phrase encapsulated the strength of the Empire. An Empress had to be crafty, strong, and skilled if she was to survive. Only the fittest deserved to sit on the Crystal Throne. If one of her siblings, or a member of the High Blood like Galgan, managed to kill her, then her death served the Empire—for she had obviously been too weak to lead it.</p>
<p class="tx">May she live forever. May she be strong enough to live forever. May she be strong enough to lead us to victory. She <span class="epub-i1">would</span> bring order to this world. That was her goal.</p>
<p class="tx">Matrim stalked past on the army’s gathering grounds, passing ten paces before Fortuona’s throne. He wore an Imperial high general’s uniform, although not well. He kept snagging the paltron-cloths on things. A high general’s regalia was meant to give the bearer authority, to enhance his grace as cloth rippled in response to his careful movements. On Matrim, it was like wrapping a racehorse in silk and expecting him to run. He had a kind of grace, but it was not the grace of court.</p>
<p class="tx">Lesser commanders trailed after him. Matrim baffled the Blood. That was good, as it kept them off balance. But he also represented disorder, with his random ways and constant stabs at authority. Fortuona represented order, and she had married <span class="epub-i1">chaos himself</span>. What had she been thinking?</p>
<p class="tx">“But what of the Sea Folk, Highness?” General Yulan said, stopping beside Matrim in front of Fortuona.</p>
<p class="tx">“Stop worrying about the bloody Sea Folk,” Matrim snapped. “If you say the words ‘Sea Folk’ one more time, I’ll hang you by your toenails from one of those <span class="epub-i1">raken</span> you fly about on and send you off to Shara.”</p>
<p class="tx">Yulan seemed perplexed. “Highness, I…”</p>
<p class="tx">He trailed off as Matrim yelled, “Savara, we’re leading with pikes, not cavalry, you goat-loving idiot! I don’t <span class="epub-i1">care</span> if the cavalry thinks it can do a better job. Cavalry always thinks that! What are you, a bloody Tairen High Lady? Well, I’ll name you an honorary one if you keep this up!”</p>
<p class="tx">Matrim stormed off toward Savara, who sat her horse with arms folded, displeasure on her dark face. Yulan, left behind, looked completely bewildered. “How does one hang a person by their toenails?” Yulan asked, softly enough that Fortuona barely heard. “I do not think that is possible. The nails would break off.” He walked away, shaking his head.</p>
<p class="tx">To the side, Selucia signed, <span class="epub-i1">Beware. Galgan approaches.</span></p>
<p class="tx">Fortuona steeled herself as Captain-General Galgan rode up. He wore black armor rather than a uniform like Matrim’s, and he wore it well. Commanding, almost towering, he was her greatest rival and her strongest resource. Any man in his position would be a rival, of course. That was the way of things—the proper way of things.</p>
<p class="tx">Matrim would never be a rival. She still did not know how to think of that. A piece of her—small, but not without strength—thought she should have him put away for that very reason. Was not the Prince of the Ravens a check upon the Empress, to keep her strong by providing a constant threat? <span class="epub-i1">Sa’rabat shaiqen nai batain pyast.</span> A woman was most resourceful with a knife at her throat. A proverb uttered by Varuota, her great-great-great-grandmother.</p>
<p class="tx">She would hate to put Matrim away. She couldn’t until she had a child by him, anyway—it would be ignoring the omens to do otherwise.</p>
<p class="tx">Such a strange man he was. Each time she thought she could anticipate him, she was proved wrong.</p>
<p class="tx">“Greatest One,” Galgan said, “we are nearly ready.”</p>
<p class="tx">“The Prince of the Ravens is dissatisfied with the delays,” she said. “He fears we are joining the battle too late.”</p>
<p class="tx">“If the Prince of the Ravens has any <span class="epub-i1">real</span> understanding of armies and battlefields,” Galgan said, his tone indicating that he didn’t believe such a thing was possible, “he will realize that moving a force of this size requires no small effort.”</p>
<p class="tx">Up until Matrim’s arrival, Galgan had been the highest-ranking member of the Blood in these lands other than Fortuona herself. He would dislike being superseded suddenly. As of yet, Galgan had command of their armies—and Fortuona intended to let him continue to lead. Earlier today, Galgan had asked Matrim how he would gather their forces, and Matrim had taken it as a suggestion to do just that. The Prince of the Ravens strode about giving orders, but he did <span class="epub-i1">not</span> command. Not fully; Galgan could stop him with a word.</p>
<p class="tx">He did not. Obviously, he wished to see how Matrim handled command. Galgan watched Matrim, eyes narrowed. He did not fully know how the Prince of the Ravens fit into the command structure. Fortuona had yet to make a decision on that.</p>
<p class="tx">Nearby, a burst of wind carried away some dust. It revealed the small skull of a rodent, peeking from the earth. Another omen. Her life had been cluttered with them lately.</p>
<p class="tx">This was an omen of danger, of course. It was as if she strolled through deep grasses, passing between stalking <span class="epub-i1">lopar</span> and among holes dug to catch the unwary. The Dragon Reborn had knelt before the Crystal Throne, and the omen of peach blossoms—the most powerful omen she knew—had accompanied him.</p>
<p class="tx">Troops marched past, officers shouting orders in time to the steps. The <span class="epub-i1">raken</span> calls seemed timed to the beats of the falling feet. This was what she would be leaving for an unknown war in lands she barely knew. Her lands here would be virtually undefended, a foreigner of newly minted loyalty in command.</p>
<p class="tx">Great change. Her decisions could end her rule and, indeed, the Empire itself. Matrim did not understand that.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Summon my consort,</span> Fortuona signed, tapping the armrest of her throne.</p>
<p class="tx">Selucia Voiced the order to a messenger. After a short time, Matrim rode up on his horse. He had refused the gift of a new one, with good reason. He had a better eye for horseflesh than the Imperial stablemaster herself. Still. Pips. What a silly name.</p>
<p class="tx">Fortuona stood up. Immediately, those nearby bowed. Galgan dismounted and went down on his knees. Everyone else prostrated themselves to the ground. The Empress standing to proclaim meant an act of the Crystal Throne.</p>
<p class="tx">“Blood and ashes,” Matrim said. “More bowing? Have you folks nothing better to do? I could think of a few dozen things, if you can’t.”</p>
<p class="tx">To the side, she saw Galgan smile. He thought he knew what she was going to do. He was wrong.</p>
<p class="tx">“I name you Knotai, for you are a bringer of destruction to the Empire’s enemies. Let your new name only be spoken from now into eternity, Knotai. I proclaim that Knotai, Prince of the Ravens, is to be given the rank of Rodholder in our armies. Let it be published as my will.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rodholder. It meant that should Galgan fall, Matrim would have command. Galgan was no longer smiling. He would have to keep watch over his shoulder lest Matrim overcome him and take control.</p>
<p class="tx">Fortuona sat down.</p>
<p class="tx">“Knotai?” Knotai said.</p>
<p class="tx">She glared at him. <span class="epub-i1">Keep your tongue, for once,</span> she thought at him. <span class="epub-i1">Please.</span></p>
<p class="tx">“I kind of like it,” Knotai said, turning his horse and trotting away.</p>
<p class="tx">Galgan regained his saddle. “He will need to learn to kneel,” the general muttered, then kicked his horse forward.</p>
<p class="tx">It was an ever-so-small offense, deliberate and calculating. Galgan had not addressed the words to Fortuona directly, instead acting as if they were just a comment to himself. He sidestepped calling her Greatest One.</p>
<p class="tx">It was enough to make Selucia growl softly and wiggle her fingers in a question.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">No,</span> Fortuona signed, <span class="epub-i1">we need him.</span></p>
<p class="tx">Once again, Knotai did not seem to realize what she had done, and the risk inherent in it. Galgan would have to consult with him on their battle plans; the Rodholder could not be left out of meetings, as he had to be ready to take control at any moment. Galgan would have to listen to his advice and incorporate it.</p>
<p class="tx">She bet upon her prince in this, hoping that he could manifest again the unexpected genius in battle that had so impressed Furyk Karede.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">This is bold,</span> Selucia said. <span class="epub-i1">But what if he fails?</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">We will not fail,</span> Fortuona replied, <span class="epub-i1">for this is the Last Battle.</span></p>
<p class="tx">The Pattern had placed Knotai before her, had shoved her into his arms. The Dragon Reborn had seen and spoken truth about her—for all the illusion of order, her rule was like a heavy rock balanced on its smallest point. She was stretched thin, reigning over lands unaccustomed to discipline. She needed to take great risks to bring order to chaos.</p>
<p class="tx">She hoped that Selucia would see it that way and not publicly denounce her. Fortuona really would need to find a new Voice or appoint someone else as Truthspeaker. Having one person fill both roles was drawing criticism in court. It—</p>
<p class="tx">Knotai suddenly came riding back, holding to his hat. “Tuon!”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Why is it so hard for him to understand names?</span> Selucia asked with a wiggle of her fingers. Fortuona could almost read the sigh in those motions.</p>
<p class="tx">“Knotai?” Fortuona asked. “You may approach.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Bloody good,” Knotai said, “since I’m already here. Tuon, we need to move <span class="epub-i1">now</span>. The scouts just came back. Egwene’s army is in trouble.”</p>
<p class="tx">Yulan rode up just behind Knotai, then dismounted and bowed himself full to the ground.</p>
<p class="tx">“Rise,” Fortuona said. “Is this true?”</p>
<p class="tx">“The army of the <span class="epub-i1">marath’damane</span> has suffered a grave defeat,” Yulan said. “The returning Fists of Heaven describe it in detail. This Amyrlin’s armies are scattered, in turmoil, and retreating at speed.”</p>
<p class="tx">Galgan had stopped nearby to receive a messenger, no doubt being given a similar report. The general looked at her.</p>
<p class="tx">“We should move in to support Egwene’s retreat,” Knotai said. “I don’t know what a Rodholder is, but from how everyone’s reacting, I think it means I have control of the armies.”</p>
<p class="tx">“No,” Fortuona said. “You are third. Behind me. Behind Galgan.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Then you can order a move right now,” Knotai said. “We need to go! Egwene is getting stomped.”</p>
<p class="tx">“How many <span class="epub-i1">marath’damane</span> are there?” Fortuona asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“We have been watching this army,” Yulan said. “There are hundreds. The entirety of the White Tower that remains. They are exhausted, being driven forth by a new force, one we do not recognize.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Tuon…” Matrim warned.</p>
<p class="tx">Great change. So this was the meaning of the Dragon’s omen. Fortuona could swoop in and all of those <span class="epub-i1">damane</span> would be hers. Hundreds upon hundreds. With that force, she could crush the resistance to her rule back in Seanchan.</p>
<p class="tx">It was the Last Battle. The world hung upon her decisions. Was it truly better to support these <span class="epub-i1">marath’damane</span> in their desperate fight here, or should she use the chance to retreat to Seanchan, secure her rule there, then defeat the Trollocs and the Shadow with the might of the Empire?</p>
<p class="tx">“You gave your word,” Knotai said softly.</p>
<p class="tx">“I signed a treaty,” she said. “Any treaty can be broken, particularly by the Empress.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Some empresses might be able to do that,” Knotai said. “But not you. Right? Light, Tuon. You gave him your <span class="epub-i1">word</span>.”</p>
<p class="tx">Order in one hand—something known, something she could measure—chaos in the other. Chaos in the form of a one-eyed man who knew Artur Hawkwing’s face.</p>
<p class="tx">Had she not just told Selucia she would bet upon him?</p>
<p class="tx">“The Empress cannot be constrained by words on a paper,” Fortuona said. “However … in this case, the reason I signed the treaty remains, and is real. We will protect this world in its darkest days, and we will destroy the Shadow at its root. General Galgan, you shall move our forces to protect these <span class="epub-i1">marath’damane</span>, as we will require their aid in fighting the Shadow.”</p>
<p class="tx">Knotai relaxed. “Good. Yulan, Galgan, let’s get planning! And send for that woman, Tylee. She seems like the only bloody general around here with her head on her shoulders. And…”</p>
<p class="tx">He went on talking, riding off, giving orders that he really should have allowed Galgan to give. Galgan studied her from horseback, his face unreadable. He’d consider this a grave mistake, but she … she had the omens on her side.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Those dreadful black clouds had been Lan’s companion for far too long. He had grown weary indeed of seeing them each day, expanding toward infinity in all directions, rumbling with thunder like growls from the stomach of a hungry beast.</p>
<p class="tx">“The clouds seem lower today,” Andere said, from his horse beside Mandarb. “The lightning is touching down. It doesn’t do that every day.”</p>
<p class="tx">Lan nodded. Andere was right; it did look bad. That didn’t change a thing. Agelmar had chosen the place for their battle alongside the river roaring on their western flank, using it to protect that side. Nearby hills provided archer positions, and it was atop one of these that Lan and Andere waited.</p>
<p class="tx">Ahead, the Trollocs gathered for an assault. They would come soon. Closer by, Agelmar had placed heavy cavalry in the valleys for flanking attacks once the Trollocs charged, light cavalry behind the hills to help the heavy cavalry withdraw when the time came. Agelmar kept grumbling about not having any pikes, though it was the lack of foot that had facilitated their successful retreat.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">For all the good it has done,</span> Lan thought gloomily as he studied the near-endless sea of Trollocs. His men had picked their battles carefully, killing tens of thousands while losing only thousands, leaving Shienar burned and unable to sustain the Trolloc advance. None of it seemed to have mattered.</p>
<p class="tx">They were losing this fight. Yes, they had delayed the Trollocs, but not well enough—and not long enough. They would soon be trapped and destroyed, with no aid coming from Elayne’s army, which was pressed just as badly.</p>
<p class="tx">The sky darkened. Lan looked up sharply. Those clouds were still there, but they grew much more ominous. The land was cast into deep shadow.</p>
<p class="tx">“Blast it,” Andere said, looking up. “Has the Dark One somehow swallowed the sun? We’ll have to carry lanterns to fight, even though it’s the middle of the day.”</p>
<p class="tx">Lan placed his hand to his breastplate; beneath the armor, Nynaeve’s letter rested next to his heart. <span class="epub-i1">Light! May her fight go better than my own.</span> Earlier today, she and Rand had entered the Pit of Doom itself.</p>
<p class="tx">Across the battlefield, the tired channelers, pulling their eyes from the terrifyingly dark sky, sent up lights. It wasn’t much to see by, but it would have to do. But then the darkness receded, and daylight returned, clouded as had become usual.</p>
<p class="tx">“Gather the High Guard of Malkier,” Lan said. That was what his protectors were calling themselves. It was an old Malkieri term for the King’s battlefield guard. Lan wasn’t certain what to make of the fact that Prince Kaisel, who was from Kandor, considered himself one.</p>
<p class="tx">Many of Lan’s Malkieri had very little true Malkier blood—they came to him as an honor more than anything else. The Prince was another matter. Lan had asked him and his companions if they should be swearing to a foreign king, no matter how friendly.</p>
<p class="tx">The only reply he’d received was, “Malkier represents the Borderlands in this war, Dai Shan.”</p>
<p class="tx">Lightning flashed nearby; the clap of thunder beat against Lan like a physical thing. Mandarb barely stirred. The animal was growing accustomed to such strikes. The High Guard gathered, and Andere took up Lan’s banner, affixing it in the socket on his saddle so that he could carry it, but still swing a sword.</p>
<p class="tx">Their orders arrived from Agelmar. Lan and his men would be in the very thick of the attack. Once the Trollocs charged, the heavy cavalry would hit the flanks to break up their momentum. Lan and his men would hit the creatures face-on.</p>
<p class="tx">As Lan preferred it. Agelmar knew better than to try to coddle him. Lan and his troops would hold the center ground before the hills, forcing the Trollocs to fight in such a way that the archers could lob volley after volley into their back ranks. Harrying forces would be held mostly in reserve, to prevent the enemy sweeping around their right flank; the river was on their left, a natural deterrent to the Trollocs. A good plan, if any plan could be considered a good one in the face of such overwhelming odds. Still, Agelmar was not making mistakes that Lan could see. He complained of troubled dreams lately, but considering the war they fought, Lan would have been more worried if the man <span class="epub-i1">hadn’t</span> dreamed of death and battle.</p>
<p class="tx">The Trollocs started to move.</p>
<p class="tx">“Forward!” Lan called as the trumpets sounded in the air, accompanied by thunder from above.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">A short distance from the walls of Cairhien, Elayne rode Moonshadow along the front lines; the army had formed up according to Bashere’s battle plans, but she was worried.</p>
<p class="tx">They had done it. A fast march upriver along the road to arrive at Cairhien in front of the Trolloc army. Elayne had positioned their force on the far northern side of Cairhien to face the Trolloc army coming in from that direction. She had also left some of the dragons and a company of bowmen downriver to deter the Trollocs trying to cross the river there; they would withdraw quickly northward when it became impossible to prevent the enemy from crossing.</p>
<p class="tx">Beat the army ahead; then face the one behind. It was their only chance. The Kinswomen were exhausted; Elayne had required many gateways to move her men. Their fatigue meant Elayne would have no channelers in this fight. The women would be hard-pressed to make small gateways to Mayene to deliver the wounded for Healing.</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne’s army was slightly larger than that of the Shadowspawn, but her men were exhausted. Amid the anxiety of a coming battle, some slumped in their lines, pikes tipping forward. Those who stood firm had reddened eyes nonetheless. They still had Aludra’s dragons. That would have to be enough.</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne hadn’t slept the night before. She’d spent the time searching for inspiring words, seeking something she could say this day that would have meaning. What did you say when all was coming to an end?</p>
<p class="tx">She halted Moonshadow at the front of the line of Andoran soldiers. Her words would be relayed, using weaves, to the entire army. Elayne was surprised to see that some of the Aiel were drawing close to listen. She wouldn’t have thought they’d care about the words of a wetlander queen.</p>
<p class="tx">She opened her mouth to speak, and the sun went out.</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne froze, looking upward with shock. The clouds had parted above them—they often did when she was near, one way the bond with Rand manifested—and so she’d been expecting an open sky and light for this battle.</p>
<p class="tx">The sun still shone up there, but occluded. Something solid and dark rolled in front of it.</p>
<p class="tx">All across her army, men looked up, raising fingers as they were swallowed by darkness. Light! It was hard to keep from trembling.</p>
<p class="tx">She heard cries through the army. Lamentations, worries, cries of despair. Elayne gathered her confidence and kicked her horse forward.</p>
<p class="tx">“This is the place,” she announced, enhancing her voice with the One Power to project across the field, “where I promise you we will win. This is where I tell you that days will continue, that the land will recover. This is the time when I promise you that the light will return, that hope will survive, that we will continue to live.”</p>
<p class="tx">She paused. Behind the army, people lined the top of Cairhien’s city walls: children, women, and the elderly who were armed with kitchen knives and pots to throw down, should the Trollocs destroy the army and come for the city. There had barely been time to contact them; a skeleton force of soldiers guarded the city. Now, their distant figures huddled down as darkness ate the sky.</p>
<p class="tx">Those walls offered a false safety; they meant little when the enemy had Dreadlords. She needed to defeat the Trolloc army quickly, not hide and allow them to be reinforced by the larger force to the south.</p>
<p class="tx">“I am supposed to reassure you,” Elayne shouted to the men. “But I cannot! I will <span class="epub-i1">not</span> tell you that the land will survive, that the Light will prevail. Doing so would remove responsibility.</p>
<p class="tx">“This is our duty! Our blood that will be spilled this day. We have come here to fight. If we do not, then the land will die! The Light will fall to the Shadow. This is not a day for empty promises. Our blood! Our blood is the fire within us. Today, our blood must drive us to defeat the Shadow.”</p>
<p class="tx">She turned her horse. The men had looked away from the darkness above, toward her. She wove a light, high in the sky above her, drawing their attention.</p>
<p class="tx">“Our blood is our passion,” she shouted. “Too much of what I hear from my armies is about resistance. We cannot merely resist! We must show them our anger, our fury, at what they have done. We must not resist. Today, we must <span class="epub-i1">destroy</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">“Our blood is our land. This place is ours, and we claim it! For our fathers and mothers, for our children.</p>
<p class="tx">“Our blood is our life. We have come to give it. Across the world, other armies are pushed back. We will not retreat. Our task is to spend our blood, to die <span class="epub-i1">advancing</span>. We will not remain still, no!</p>
<p class="tx">“If we are to have the Light again, we must <span class="epub-i1">make</span> it ours! We must reclaim it and cast out the Shadow! He seeks to make you despair, to win this battle before it begins. We will not give him that satisfaction! We will destroy this army before us, then destroy the one behind. And from there, we bring our blood—our life, our fire, our passion—to the others who fight. From there it spreads to victory and the Light!”</p>
<p class="tx">She honestly didn’t know what kind of response to expect from a battlefield speech. She’d read all of the great ones, particularly those given by queens of Andor. When younger, she’d imagined the soldiers clapping and shouting—the response given to a gleeman at a rowdy tavern.</p>
<p class="tx">Instead, the men raised weapons to her. Drawn swords, pikes lifted, then thumped back against the ground. The Aiel did give some whoops, but the Andorans looked at her with solemn eyes. She had not inspired them to excitement, but to determination. That seemed the more honest emotion. They ignored the darkness in the sky and turned eyes on the goal.</p>
<p class="tx">Birgitte walked up beside her horse. “That was quite good, Elayne. When did you change it?”</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne blushed, thinking of the carefully prepared speech she’d memorized last night while repeating it half a dozen times to Birgitte. It had been a work of beauty, with allusions to the sayings of queens through the ages.</p>
<p class="tx">She’d forgotten every word of it once that darkness had come. This one had spurted out instead.</p>
<p class="tx">“Come on,” Elayne said, looking over her shoulder. The Trolloc army was arriving opposite hers. “I need to move into position.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Into position?” Birgitte asked. “You mean that you need to go back to the command tent.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m not going there,” Elayne said, turning Moonshadow.</p>
<p class="tx">“Blood and bloody ashes, you aren’t! I—”</p>
<p class="tx">“Birgitte,” Elayne snapped. “I am in command, and you are my soldier. You <span class="epub-i1">will</span> obey.”</p>
<p class="tx">Birgitte recoiled as if slapped.</p>
<p class="tx">“Bashere has the command tent,” Elayne said. “I’m one of the few channelers of any strength this army has, and I’ll be drawn and quartered before I let myself sit out the fight. I’m easily worth a thousand soldiers on this battlefield.”</p>
<p class="tx">“The babes—”</p>
<p class="tx">“Even if Min hadn’t had that viewing, I’d still insist on fighting. You think the babes of these soldiers aren’t at risk? Many of them line the walls of that city! If we fail here, they will be <span class="epub-i1">slaughtered</span>. No, I will <span class="epub-i1">not</span> keep myself out of danger, and no, I will <span class="epub-i1">not</span> sit back and wait. If you think it’s your duty as my Warder to stop me, then I will bloody sever this bond right here and now and send you to someone else! I’m not going to spend the Last Battle lounging on a chaise and drinking goat’s milk!”</p>
<p class="tx">Birgitte fell silent, and Elayne could feel her shock through the bond. “Light,” the woman finally said. “I won’t stop you. But will you at least agree to back away for the initial arrow volleys? You can do more good helping the lines where they’re weakened.”</p>
<p class="tx">She allowed Birgitte and her guards to lead the way back to a hillside near Aludra’s dragons. Talmanes, Aludra and their crews waited with more anxiety and eagerness than the regular troops. They were tired, too, but they’d also seen little use during the forest battles and the retreat. Today was their chance to shine.</p>
<p class="tx">Bashere’s battle plan was as complex as any that Elayne had been a part of. The bulk of the army positioned itself almost a mile north of the city, beyond the Foregate ruins outside the city walls. The army’s lines ran east from the Alguenya, across a hillside that sloped down across an approach road to the Jangai Gates on the flats, all the way to the ruins of the Illuminators’ chapter house.</p>
<p class="tx">Ranks of foot soldiers—mostly Andorans and Cairhienin, but some Ghealdanin and Whitecloaks as well—bowed out like a half-moon across the front of Elayne’s forces. Six squadrons of dragons rolled up atop the hill behind the foot.</p>
<p class="tx">The Trollocs would not reach the city without defeating this army. Estean had the Band’s cavalry on one flank while the Mayener Winged Guards covered the other. The rest of the cavalry was held in reserve.</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne waited with patience, watching the Trolloc army prepare. Her biggest worry was that they’d just sit there, waiting for their fellow Trollocs to arrive from the south and attack Elayne simultaneously. Fortunately, that didn’t happen—they had apparently been commanded to take the city, and they were planning to do it.</p>
<p class="tx">Bashere’s scout reports indicated that the second army was a little over a day’s march away, and could arrive late on the morrow if they marched hard. Elayne had until then to defeat this northern force.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Come on,</span> Elayne thought. <span class="epub-i1">Move.</span></p>
<p class="tx">The Trollocs finally began to surge forward. Bashere and Elayne were counting on them to employ their usual tactic: Overwhelming numbers and sheer force. Indeed, today, the Trollocs crashed forward in a large mass. Their goal would be to overwhelm the defenders, shattering their lines.</p>
<p class="tx">Her troops stood firm, knowing what was coming next. The dragons began to bellow, each like innumerable hammers falling at exactly the same moment. Elayne was now a good hundred paces from them, and still she had the urge to cover her ears. Rolling clouds of white smoke began to fill the sky above the dragons as they fired.</p>
<p class="tx">The first few shots fell short, but Aludra and her men used the shots to adjust range. After that, the eggs fell among Trollocs, ripping through their ranks, tossing them into the air. Thousands of body parts fell to the crimson-splattered ground. For the first time, Elayne was frightened of the weapons.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Light, Birgitte has been right all along,</span> Elayne thought, imagining what it would be like to charge a fortified position equipped with dragons. Normally, in war, at least a man could depend on one thing: that his skill would be placed against that of his foe. Sword against sword. Trollocs were bad enough. What would it be like for men to have to face this kind of power?</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">We’ll make sure it doesn’t happen,</span> she told herself. Rand had been right to force that peace upon them.</p>
<p class="tx">The dragoners had trained well, and their reloading speeds were impressive. Each set off three volleys before the Trollocs hit the front lines. Elayne hadn’t watched the exchange of arrows—she’d been too focused on the dragons—but she did see that some of her lines were struck with black-fletched arrows, and men were down and bleeding.</p>
<p class="tx">The Trollocs crashed into her front ranks of crossbowmen and pikemen, who were already fading back to make way for halberdiers. Nobody used swords and maces against Trollocs, at least not while on foot, if they could help it.</p>
<p class="tx">“Let’s go,” Elayne said, moving Moonshadow forward.</p>
<p class="tx">Birgitte followed; Elayne could sense the woman’s reluctant resignation. They moved down off the hill through some reserve units and entered the battle.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Rodel Ituralde had almost forgotten what it was like to have adequate resources at his command.</p>
<p class="tx">It had been some time since he had commanded legions of men and full banners of archers. For once, his men weren’t half-starved, and Healers, fletchers and good smiths stood ready to repair his troops and equipment nightly. What a wonder it was to be able to ask for something—no matter how unusual—and have it located and brought to him, often within the hour!</p>
<p class="tx">He was still going to lose. He faced a numberless host of foes, Dreadlords by the dozen and even some of the Forsaken. He’d brought his force into this dead-end valley, seizing the jewel of the Dark One’s lands—his very footstool, the black mountain. And now the sun itself had gone out, though the Aes Sedai said that would pass.</p>
<p class="tx">Ituralde puffed on his pipe as he rode his horse along the ridge that edged the valley to the north. Yes, he was going to lose. But with these resources, he’d do it with <span class="epub-i1">style</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">He followed along the ridge, reaching a point above the pass into Thakan’dar. The valley, deep in the heart of the Blasted Lands, ran east to west, with Shayol Ghul at the western side and the pass on the east. One could reach this vantage only after hours of very hard climbing—or one quick step through a gateway. Handy, that. It was perfect for surveying his defenses.</p>
<p class="tx">The pass into Shayol Ghul was like a large slot canyon, the top completely inaccessible from the eastern side except by gateway. With a gateway, he could reach the top and look down into the canyon, which was perhaps wide enough to march fifty men down shoulder-to-shoulder. A perfect bottleneck. And he could position archers up top here, to fire down on those coming through the pass.</p>
<p class="tx">The sun finally burned out from behind the blackness above, like a drop of molten steel. So the Aes Sedai had been right. Still, those swirling black thunderheads spun back, as if to consume all the sky.</p>
<p class="tx">Since Shayol Ghul lay in the Blasted Lands, the air was chill enough that Ituralde wore a woolen winter cloak and his breath was white in front of him. Fog hung over the valley, thinner than it had been when the forges worked.</p>
<p class="tx">He left the canyon mouth and moved back to a group of people that had come with him. Windfinders and other high-ranking Sea Folk stood in long coats that they had—hawkishly, of course—traded for before coming north. Colorful clothing peeked out beneath. It, and the many ornaments on their faces, seemed a strange contrast to the dull brown coats.</p>
<p class="tx">Ituralde was Domani. He’d had more than a share of dealings with the Sea Folk; if they proved half as tenacious in battle as they were in negotiations, he was happy indeed to have them with him. They had insisted on coming up here to the ridge so they could survey the valley below and the pass into it.</p>
<p class="tx">The woman at their front was the Mistress of the Ships herself, Zaida din Parede Blackwing. A short woman, she had dark skin, and gray strands wove through her short black hair. “The Windfinders send word to you, Rodel Ituralde,” she said. “The attack has begun.”</p>
<p class="tx">“The attack?”</p>
<p class="tx">“The Bringer of Gales,” Zaida said, looking toward the sky, where the dark clouds rumbled and churned. “The Father of Storms. He would destroy you with the force of his ire.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Your people can handle it, right?”</p>
<p class="tx">“The Windfinders already confront him with the power of the Bowl of the Winds,” Zaida said. “If it were not so, he would have destroyed us all with tempests already.”</p>
<p class="tx">She still watched the sky, as did many of her companions. There were only about a hundred Sea Folk with him, not counting the Windfinders. Most of the rest worked with the supply teams, relaying arrows, food and other equipment to the four battlefronts. They seemed particularly interested in the steamwagons, though Ituralde couldn’t fathom why. The devices couldn’t match a good team of horses. “Confronting the Dark One himself, gust for gust,” Zaida said. “We will sing of this day.” She looked back to Ituralde. “You must protect the Coramoor,” she said sternly, as if scolding him.</p>
<p class="tx">“I’ll do my part,” Ituralde said, continuing on his way. “Just do yours.”</p>
<p class="tx">“This bargain was sealed long ago, Rodel Ituralde,” she called after him.</p>
<p class="tx">He nodded, continuing back along the ridge. Men stationed at watchposts saluted as he passed. Well, the ones that weren’t Aiel. He had a lot of the Aiel up here, where they could use their bows. He’d put the bulk of his Tairens down below, where those pikes and polearms would be of maximum use. They would hold the path into Shayol Ghul.</p>
<p class="tx">A distant Aiel horn blew; a signal from one of the scouts. The Trollocs had entered the pass. It was time.</p>
<p class="tx">He galloped back along the ridge toward the valley, trailed by other commanders and King Alsalam. When they reached the point where he had set up his primary watchpost, a vantage from which he could see miles back into the pass, Ituralde took out his looking glass.</p>
<p class="tx">Shadows moved there. In moments, he could make out the Trolloc hordes charging forward, whipped to a frenzy. For a moment, he was back in Maradon, watching his men—good men—fall one by one. Overrun at the hill fortifications, pulled down in the streets of the city. The explosion on the wall.</p>
<p class="tx">Desperate act after desperate act. Killing as many as he could, like a screaming man clubbing wolves as they tore him to pieces, hoping to take at least one with him into the final darkness.</p>
<p class="tx">His hand, holding the looking glass, quivered. He forced himself back to the present and his current defenses. It felt as if he’d been fighting losing battles his entire life. That took a toll. At night, he would hear Trollocs coming. Snorting, sniffing the air, hooves on the cobbles. Flashbacks from Maradon.</p>
<p class="tx">“Steady, old friend,” King Alsalam said, riding up beside him. The King had a soothing voice. He’d always been able to calm others. Ituralde was certain the merchants of Arad Doman had chosen him for that reason. Tensions could run high when trade and war were concerned—the Domani looked at the two as much the same beast. But Alsalam … he could calm a frantic merchant who had just lost her entire fleet at sea.</p>
<p class="tx">Ituralde nodded. The defense of this valley. He had to keep his mind on the defense of this valley. He’d hold, not let the Trollocs boil out of the pass into Thakan’dar. Burn him, he’d hold for <span class="epub-i1">months</span> if the Dragon Reborn needed it. Every other fight—every battle man had fought, and was fighting—would be meaningless if Ituralde lost here. It was time to pull out every trick he knew, every last-ditch strategy. Here, one moment of delay could earn Rand al’Thor the time he needed.</p>
<p class="tx">“Remind the men to remain steady below,” Ituralde said, surveying through his glass. “Prepare the logs.”</p>
<p class="tx">Attendants relayed the orders, which went through gateway to the squads involved. That terrible force of Trollocs continued onward, clutching enormous swords, twisted polearms, or catchpoles to pull down riders. They clamored through the pass, lightning streaking between clouds above.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">First the logs,</span> Ituralde thought.</p>
<p class="tx">As the Trollocs reached the middle of the pass, the Aiel on both sides untied piles of oiled tree trunks—there were so many dead trees in forests now that Ituralde had had no trouble fetching them through gateways—and lit them aflame.</p>
<p class="tx">Hundreds of burning logs rolled down the sides of the pass, crashing into the Trollocs. The oiled logs set flesh alight. The beasts yelled, howled and screeched depending on the orifice they’d been given. Ituralde raised his looking glass and watched them, feeling an intense satisfaction.</p>
<p class="tx">That was new. In the past, he’d never been satisfied to see his foes die. Oh, he’d been pleased when a plan worked. And, in truth, the point of fighting was to see the other fellow dead and your men alive—but there had been no <span class="epub-i1">joy</span> in that. The longer you fought, the more you saw the enemy as being like yourself. The banners changed, but the rank and file were much the same. They wanted to win, but usually they were more interested in a good meal, a blanket to sleep on and boots without holes in them.</p>
<p class="tx">This was different. Ituralde wanted to see those beasts dead. He <span class="epub-i1">lusted</span> after it. Without them, he’d never have been forced to suffer the nightmare at Maradon. Without them, his hand wouldn’t shake when the horns of war sounded. They’d ruined him.</p>
<p class="tx">He’d ruin them in return.</p>
<p class="tx">The Trollocs pushed through the jumble of logs with great difficulty. Many of them had been set alight, and the Myrddraal had to whip them to keep them moving. Many seemed to want to eat the flesh of the fallen. The rank scent of it made them hungry. Cooked bodies. To them, it was like the aroma of fresh bread.</p>
<p class="tx">The Fades succeeded in driving them on, but the Trollocs soon reached the next of Ituralde’s defenses. Figuring out what to do had been a trick. You couldn’t plant spikes or dig ditches in that solid rock, not without running your channelers to exhaustion. He could have made piles of rock or earth, but Trollocs were big, and mounds that would slow men were less effective against them. Beyond that, moving so much earth and stone would have meant diverting workers from building real fortifications in the valley. He’d learned early that in a defensive war, you wanted the fortifications to grow progressively better. You lasted longer that way, as you kept the enemy from gaining momentum.</p>
<p class="tx">In the end, the solution had been simple. Brambles.</p>
<p class="tx">He’d remembered huge thickets of them, dry and dead, back in Arad Doman. Ituralde’s father had been a farmer, and had always complained about the thorn thickets. Well, if there was one thing mankind was not lacking, it was dead plants. Another was manpower. Thousands had flocked to the Dragon’s call, and many of these Dragonsworn had little battle experience.</p>
<p class="tx">He’d still set them fighting when that time came. For now, however, he’d sent them to cut down enormous thornbushes. They’d placed these across the pass, lashed together, in masses twenty feet thick and eight feet tall. The thorn bales had been relatively easy to place—far lighter than stones or dirt—yet amassed as they were, the Trollocs couldn’t move them simply by pushing. The first ranks ran up against them and tried, but were rewarded with five-inch thorns biting into them. The creatures in the rear pressed forward, causing the front ranks to turn in anger and rise up against those behind.</p>
<p class="tx">This left the bulk of the Trolloc forces frozen in the pass, at his mercy.</p>
<p class="tx">He didn’t have much mercy for Shadowspawn.</p>
<p class="tx">Ituralde gave the signal, and the Asha’man with him—Awlsten, one of those who had served under him at Maradon—shot a bright burst of red light into the sky. Along the sides above the pass, more Aiel came out and began to roll boulders and more burning logs down upon the trapped Shadowspawn. Arrows and stones followed—anything they could shoot, throw or drop onto those below.</p>
<p class="tx">Most of these attacks from Ituralde’s men happened farther down the pass, in the middle of the bulk of Trollocs. That caused half to pull back and shy away, while the others pushed forward to get away—shoving their allies in front into the brambles.</p>
<p class="tx">Some Trollocs carried shields, and tried to protect themselves against the deadly hail. Wherever they formed together defensively and began to make a shield wall above themselves, Ituralde’s channelers struck, tearing them apart.</p>
<p class="tx">He couldn’t spare many channelers for the work—most were back in the valley, making gateways to move supplies and watching for enemy channelers. They’d already had a second run-in with Dreadlords. Aviendha and Cadsuane Sedai had those operations in hand.</p>
<p class="tx">Some of the Trollocs shot arrows at the defenders above, but casualties mounted as the Shadowspawn at the front tried to hack their way through the abatis of thorns. It was slow going.</p>
<p class="tx">Ituralde watched, cold inside and out, as the Myrddraal whipped the Trollocs into a stampede. That shoved the ones working on the thorns forward, impaling them, trampling them.</p>
<p class="tx">Blood became a stream running back down toward the eastern end of the pass, making the Trollocs slip. They pushed the front five or six lines, breaking the thorns on the bodies of the beasts there.</p>
<p class="tx">It still took them the better part of an hour to break through. They left thousands dead as they surged forward, then found a <span class="epub-i1">second</span> abatis, thicker and higher than the first. Ituralde had placed seven at intervals in the pass. The second was the largest, and it had the desired effect. Seeing it made the Trollocs at the front pull up short. Then they turned and broke backward.</p>
<p class="tx">Mass confusion resulted. Trollocs behind cried and shouted, pressing forward. Those in front snarled and howled as they tried to cut through the brambles. Some stood dazed. All the while arrows and rocks and burning logs continued to fall.</p>
<p class="tx">“Beautiful,” Alsalam whispered.</p>
<p class="tx">Ituralde found that his arm was no longer quivering. He lowered his looking glass. “Let’s go.”</p>
<p class="tx">“The battle is not through!” the King protested.</p>
<p class="tx">“It is,” Ituralde said, turning away. “For now.”</p>
<p class="tx">True to his word, the entire Trolloc army broke behind him—he could hear it happening—and fled eastward down the pass, away from the valley.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">One day held,</span> Ituralde thought. They would be back on the morrow, and then they would be ready. More shields, better weapons at the front for cutting thorns.</p>
<p class="tx">They’d still bleed. Bleed dearly.</p>
<p class="tx">He’d make certain of it.</p>
