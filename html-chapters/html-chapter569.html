<p class="para15"><strong class="calibre14">A Note on Dates in This Glossary.</strong> The Toman Calendar (devised by Toma dur Ahmid) was adopted approximately two centuries after the death of the last male Aes Sedai, recording years After the Breaking of the World (AB). So many records were destroyed in the Trolloc Wars that at their end there was argument about the exact year under the old system. A new calendar, proposed by Tiam of Gazar, celebrated freedom from the Trolloc threat and recorded each year as a Free Year (FY). The Gazaran Calendar gained wide acceptance within twenty years after the Wars’ end. Artur Hawkwing attempted to establish a new calendar based on the founding of his empire (FF, From the Founding), but only historians now refer to it. After the death and destruction of the War of the Hundred Years, a third calendar was devised by Uren din Jubai Soaring Gull, a scholar of the Sea Folk, and promulgated by the Panarch Farede of Tarabon. The Farede Calendar, dating from the arbitrarily decided end of the War of the Hundred Years and recording years of the New Era (NE), is currently in use.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para7"><strong class="calibre14">Arad Doman:</strong> A nation on the Aryth Ocean, currently racked by civil war and by wars against those who have declared for the Dragon Reborn. Its capital is Bandar Eban. In Arad Doman, the ruler (king or queen) is elected by a council of the heads of merchant guilds (the Council of <a id="page_604" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>Merchants), who are almost always women. He or she must be from the noble class, not the merchant, and is elected for life. Legally the king or queen has absolute authority, except that he or she can be deposed by three-quarter vote of the Council. The current ruler is King Alsalam Saeed Almadar, Lord of Almadar, High Seat of House Almadar. His present whereabouts are much shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">armsmen:</strong> Soldiers who owe allegiance or fealty to a particular lord or lady.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Asha’man:</strong> (1) In the Old Tongue, “Guardian” or “Guardians,” but the word always meant a guardian of justice and truth. (2) The name given, both collectively and as a rank, to the men who have come to the Black Tower, near Caemlyn in Andor, in order to learn to channel. Their training concentrates largely on the ways in which the One Power can be used as a weapon, and in another departure from the usages of the White Tower, once they learn to seize <em class="calibre4">saidin</em>, the male half of the Power, they are required to perform all chores and labors with the Power. When newly enrolled, a man is termed a Soldier; he wears a plain black coat with a high collar, in the Andoran fashion. Being raised to Dedicated brings the right to wear a silver pin, called the Sword, on the collar of his coat. Promotion to Asha’man brings the right to wear a Dragon pin, in gold and red enamel, on the collar opposite the Sword. Although many women, including wives, flee when they learn that their men actually can channel, a fair number of men at the Black Tower are married, and they use a version of the Warder bond to create a link with their wives. This same bond, altered to compel obedience, has recently been used to bond captured Aes Sedai as well.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para7"><strong class="calibre14">Balwer, Sebban:</strong> Formerly secretary to Pedron Niall (the Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light) in public, and secretly Niall’s spymaster. After Niall’s death, Balwer aided the escape of Morgase (once Queen of Andor) from the Seanchan in Amador for his own reasons, and now is employed as secretary to Perrin t’Bashere Aybara and Faile ni Bashere t’Aybara. Perrin is beginning to suspect that there is more to Balwer than at first appeared.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Band of the Red Hand:</strong> <em class="calibre4">see Shen an Calhar.</em></p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Blood, the:</strong> Term used by the Seanchan to designate the nobility. There are degrees of nobility. The High Blood shave the sides of their heads and paint multiple fingernails—the higher the rank, the more nails <a id="page_605" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>painted—but a member of the lesser Blood, the low Blood, may have only the nails of the little fingers painted. One can be raised to the Blood as well as born to it, and this is frequently a reward for outstanding accomplishment or service to the Empire.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para7"><strong class="calibre14">calendar:</strong> There are 10 days to the week, 28 days to the month, and 13 months to the year. Several feastdays are not part of any month; these include Sunday (the longest day of the year), the Feast of Thanksgiving (once every four years at the spring equinox), and the Feast of All Souls Salvation, also called All Souls Day (once every ten years at the autumn equinox). While the months have names—Taisham, Jumara, Saban, Aine, Adar, Saven, Amadaine, Tammaz, Maigdhal, Choren, Shaldine, Nesan, and Danu—these are seldom used except in official documents and by officials. For most people, using the seasons is good enough.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Captain-General:</strong> (1) The military rank of the leader of the Queen’s Guard, in Andor. This position is currently held by Lady Birgitte Trahelion. (2) The title given to the head of the Green Ajah, though known only to members of the Green. This position is currently held by Adelorna Bastine in the Tower, and Myrelle Berengari among the rebel Aes Sedai contingent under Egwene al’Vere.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">Cha Faile</em>:</strong> (1) In the Old Tongue, “the Falcon’s Talon.” (2) Name taken by the young Cairhienin and Tairens, attempted followers of <em class="calibre4">ji’e’toh</em>, who have sworn fealty to Faile ni Bashere t’Aybara. In secret, they act as her personal scouts and spies. Since her capture by the Shaido, they continue their activities under the guidance of Sebban Balwer.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Children of the Light:</strong> Society of strict ascetic beliefs, owing allegiance to no nation and dedicated to the defeat of the Dark One and the destruction of all Darkfriends. Founded during the War of the Hundred Years by Lothair Mantelar to proselytize against an increase in Darkfriends, they evolved during the war into a completely military society. They are extremely rigid in their beliefs, and certain that only they know the truth and the right. They consider Aes Sedai and any who support them to be Darkfriends. Known disparagingly as Whitecloaks, they were formerly headquartered in Amador, Amadicia, but were forced out when the Seanchan conquered the city. Their sign is a golden sunburst on a field of white. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Questioners.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Companions, the:</strong> The elite military formation of Illian, currently commanded by First Captain Demetre Marcolin. The Companions provide a bodyguard for the King of Illian and guard key points around the <a id="page_606" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>nation. Additionally, the Companions have traditionally been used in battle to assault the enemy’s strongest positions, to exploit weaknesses, and, if necessary, to cover the retreat of the King. Unlike most other such elite formations, foreigners (excepting Tairens, Altarans and Murandians) are not only welcome, they can rise even to the highest rank, as can commoners, which also is unusual. The uniform of the Companions consists of a green coat, a breastplate worked with the Nine Bees of Illian, and a conical helmet with a faceguard of steel bars. The First Captain wears four rings of golden braid on the cuffs of his coat, and three thin golden plumes on his helmet. The Second Captain wears three rings of golden braid on each cuff, and three golden plumes tipped with green. Lieutenants wear two yellow rings on their cuffs, and two thin green plumes, under-lieutenants one yellow ring and a single green plume. Bannermen are designated by two broken rings of yellow on the cuffs and a single yellow plume, squadmen by a single broken ring of yellow.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Consolidation, the:</strong> When the armies sent by Artur Hawkwing under his son Luthair landed in Seanchan, they discovered a shifting quilt of nations often at war with one another, where Aes Sedai often reigned. Without any equivalent of the White Tower, Aes Sedai worked for their own individual goals, using the Power. Forming small groups, they schemed against one another constantly. In large part it was this constant scheming for personal advantage and the resulting wars among the myriad nations that allowed the armies from east of the Aryth Ocean to begin the conquest of an entire continent, and for their descendants to complete it. This conquest, during which the descendants of the original armies became Seanchan as much as they conquered Seanchan, took more than nine hundred years and is called the Consolidation.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">Corenne</em>:</strong> In the Old Tongue, “the Return.” The name given by the Seanchan both to the fleet of thousands of ships and to the hundreds of thousands of soldiers, craftsmen and others carried by those ships, who will come behind the Forerunners to reclaim the lands stolen from Artur Hawkwing’s descendants. <em class="calibre4">See also Hailene</em>.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">cuendillar</em>:</strong> A supposedly indestructible substance created during the Age of Legends. Any known force used in an attempt to break it is absorbed, making <em class="calibre4">cuendillar</em> stronger. Although the making of <em class="calibre4">cuendillar</em> has been thought lost forever, rumors of new objects made from it have surfaced. It is also known as heartstone.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><a id="page_607" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14">currency:</strong> After many centuries of trade, the standard terms for coins are the same in every land: crowns (the largest coin in size), marks and pennies. Crowns and marks can be minted of gold or silver, while pennies can be silver or copper, the last often called simply a copper. In different lands, however, these coins can be of different sizes and weights. Even in one nation, coins of different sizes and weights have been minted by different rulers. Because of trade, the coins of many nations can be found almost anywhere. For that reason, bankers, moneylenders and merchants all use scales to determine the value of any given coin. Even large numbers of coins are weighed for this reason. The only paper currency is “letters-of-rights,” which are issued by bankers, guaranteeing to present a certain amount of gold or silver when the letter-of-rights is presented. Because of the long distances between cities, the length of time needed to travel from one to another, and the difficulties of transactions at long distance, a letter-of-rights may be accepted at full value in a city near to the bank that issued it, but it may be accepted only at a lower value in a city farther away. Generally, someone of means intending a long journey will carry one or more letters-of-rights to exchange for coin when needed. Letters-of-rights are usually accepted only by bankers or merchants, and would never be used in shops.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para7"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">da’covale</em>:</strong> (1) In the Old Tongue, this would be translated literally as “one who is owned,” or “person who is property.” (2) Among the Seanchan, the term often used, along with “property,” for slaves. Slavery has a long and unusual history among the Seanchan, with slaves having the ability to rise to positions of great power and open authority, including over those who are free. <em class="calibre4">See also so’jhin</em>.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Darkhounds:</strong> Shadowspawn created from lupine stock corrupted by the Dark One. While they resemble hounds in their basic shape, they are blacker than night and the size of ponies, weighing several hundred pounds each. They usually run in packs of ten or twelve, although the tracks of a larger pack have been sighted. They make no mark on soft ground, but leave prints in stone, and are frequently accompanied by the smell of burned sulphur. They will not usually venture out into the rain, but once running rain fails to stop them. Once they are on the trail, they must be confronted and defeated or the victim’s death is inevitable. The only exception to this is when the victim can reach the other side of a river or stream, since Darkhounds will not cross flowing <a id="page_608" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>water. Or supposedly not. Their blood and saliva are poison, and if either touches the skin, the victim will die slowly and in great pain. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Wild Hunt.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Daughters of Silence, the:</strong> During the history of the White Tower (over three thousand years), various women who have been put out have been unwilling to accept their fates and have tried to band together. Such groups—most of them by far, at least—have been dispersed by the White Tower as soon as found and punished severely and publicly to make sure that the lesson is carried to everyone. The last group to be dispersed called themselves the Daughters of Silence (794–798 NE). The Daughters consisted of two Accepted who had been put out of the Tower and twenty-three women they had gathered and trained. All were carried back to Tar Valon and punished, and the twenty-three were enrolled in the novice book. Only one of those, Saerin Asnobar, managed to reach the shawl. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Kin, the.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Deathwatch Guards, the:</strong> The elite military formation of the Seanchan Empire, including both humans and Ogier. The human members of the Deathwatch Guard are all <em class="calibre4">da’covale,</em> born as property and chosen while young to serve the Empress, whose personal property they are. Fanatically loyal and fiercely proud, they often display the ravens tattooed on their shoulders, the mark of a <em class="calibre4">da’covale</em> of the Empress. The Ogier members are known as Gardeners, and they are not <em class="calibre4">da’covale.</em> The Gardeners are as fiercely loyal as the human Deathwatch Guards, though, and are even more feared. Human or Ogier, the Deathwatch Guards not only are ready to die for the Empress and the Imperial family, but believe that their lives are the property of the Empress, to be disposed of as she wishes. Their helmets and armor are lacquered in dark green and blood-red, their shields are lacquered black, and their spears and swords carry black tassels. <em class="calibre4">See also da’covale</em>.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Defenders of the Stone, the:</strong> The elite military formation of Tear. The current Captain of the Stone (commander of the Defenders) is Rodrivar Tihera. Only Tairens are accepted into the Defenders, and officers are usually of noble birth, though often from minor Houses or minor branches of strong Houses. The Defenders are tasked to hold the great fortress called the Stone of Tear, in the city of Tear, to defend the city, and to provide police services in place of any City Watch or the like. Except in times of war, their duties seldom take them far from the city. Then, as with other elite formations, they are the core around which the army is formed. The uniform of the Defenders consists of a black coat with padded sleeves <a id="page_609" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>striped black-and-gold with black cuffs, a burnished breastplate, and a rimmed helmet with a faceguard of steel bars. The Captain of the Stone wears three short white plumes on his helmet, and on the cuffs of his coat three intertwined golden braids on a white band. Captains wear two white plumes and a single line of golden braid on white cuffs, lieutenants one white plume and a single line of black braid on white cuffs and under-lieutenants one short black plume and plain white cuffs. Bannermen have gold-colored cuffs on their coats, and squadmen have cuffs striped black and gold.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Delving:</strong> (1) Using the One Power to diagnose physical condition and illness. (2) Finding deposits of metal ores with the One Power. That this has long been a lost ability among Aes Sedai may account for the name becoming attached to another ability.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Depository:</strong> A division of the Tower Library. There are twelve publicly known Depositories, each having books and records pertaining to a particular subject, or to related subjects. A Thirteenth Depository, known only to Aes Sedai, contains secret documents, records and histories which may be accessed only by the Amyrlin Seat, the Keeper of the Chronicles, and the Sitters in the Hall of the Tower. And, of course, by the handful of librarians who maintain the Depository.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">der’morat-</em>:</strong> (1) In the Old Tongue, “master handler.” (2) Among the Seanchan, the prefix applied to indicate a senior and highly skilled handler of one of the exotics, one who trains others, as in <em class="calibre4">der’morat’raken</em>. <em class="calibre4">Der’morat</em> can have a fairly high social status, the highest of all held by <em class="calibre4">der’sul’dam</em>, the trainers of <em class="calibre4">sul’dam,</em> who rank with fairly high military officers. <em class="calibre4">See also morat-</em>.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para7"><strong class="calibre14">Erith:</strong> Daughter of Iva daughter of Alar. An attractive young Ogier woman whom Loial intends to marry, although at present he is on the run from her.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para7"><strong class="calibre14">Fain, Padan:</strong> Former Darkfriend, now more and worse than a Darkfriend, and an enemy of the Forsaken as much as he is of Rand al’Thor, whom he hates with a passion. Last seen in Far Madding with Toram Riatin.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Fel, Herid:</strong> The author of <em class="calibre4">Reason and Unreason</em> and other books. Fel was a student (and teacher) of history and philosophy at the Academy of Cairhien. He was discovered in his study torn limb from limb.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">First Reasoner:</strong> The title given to the head of the White Ajah. This position is currently held by Ferane Neheran in the White Tower. Ferane <a id="page_610" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>Sedai is one of only two Ajah heads to sit in the Hall of the Tower at present.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">First Weaver:</strong> The title given to the head of the Yellow Ajah. This position is currently held by Suana Dragand in the White Tower. Suana Sedai is one of only two Ajah heads to sit in the Hall of the Tower at present.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Fists of Heaven, the:</strong> Lightly armed and lightly armored Seanchan infantry carried into battle on the backs of the flying creatures called <em class="calibre4">to’raken</em>. All are small men, or women, largely because of limits as to how much weight a <em class="calibre4">to’raken</em> can carry for any distance. Considered to be among the toughest of soldiers, they are used primarily for raids, surprise assaults on positions at an enemy’s rear, and where speed in getting soldiers into place is of the essence.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Forerunners, the:</strong> <em class="calibre4">See Hailene.</em></p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Forsaken, the:</strong> The name given to thirteen powerful Aes Sedai, men and women both, who went over to the Shadow during the Age of Legends and were trapped in the sealing of the Bore into the Dark One’s prison. While it has long been believed that they alone abandoned the Light during the War of the Shadow, in fact others did as well; these thirteen were only the highest-ranking among them. The Forsaken (who call themselves the Chosen) are somewhat reduced in number since their awakening in the present day. Those thought to have survived are Demandred, Semirhage, Graendal, Mesaana, Moghedien, and two who were reincarnated in new bodies and given new names, Osan’gar and Aran’gar, although it seems possible that Osan’gar may also be dead. The life of a Forsaken is always uncertain. Recently, a man calling himself Moridin has appeared, and seems to be yet another of the dead Forsaken brought back from the grave by the Dark One. The same may be possible regarding the woman calling herself Cyndane, but since Aran’gar was a man brought back as a woman, speculation as to the original identities of Moridin and Cyndane may prove futile until more is learned.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para7"><strong class="calibre14">Gregorin:</strong> Full name Gregorin Panar de Lushenos. A member of the Council of Nine in Illian who presently serves as the Steward for the Dragon Reborn in Illian.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para7"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">Hailene</em>:</strong> In the Old Tongue, “Forerunners,” or “Those Who Come Before.” The term applied by the Seanchan to the massive expeditionary force <a id="page_611" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>sent across the Aryth Ocean to scout out the lands where Artur Hawkwing once ruled. Now under the command of the High Lady Suroth, its numbers swollen by recruits from conquered lands, the <em class="calibre4">Hailene</em> has gone far beyond its original goals, and has in fact been succeeded by the Return. <em class="calibre4">See</em> Return.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Hanlon, Daved:</strong> A Darkfriend, formerly commander of the White Lions in service to the Forsaken Rahvin while he held Caemlyn using the name Lord Gaebril. From there, Hanlon took the White Lions to Cairhien under orders to further the rebellion against the Dragon Reborn. The White Lions were destroyed by a “bubble of evil,” and Hanlon has been ordered back to Caemlyn and, under the name Doilin Mellar, has ingratiated himself with Elayne, the Daughter-Heir. According to rumor, he has done considerably more than ingratiate himself.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Head Clerk:</strong> The title given to the head of the Gray Ajah. This position is currently held by Serancha Colvine, a woman of reputedly fastidious behavior, in the Tower.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">heart:</strong> The basic unit of organization in the Black Ajah. In effect, a cell. A heart consists of three sisters who know each other; each member of the heart knows one additional sister of the Black.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para7"><strong class="calibre14">Illuminators, Guild of:</strong> A society that held the secret of making fireworks. It guarded this secret very closely, even to the extent of murder. The Guild gained its name from the grand displays, called Illuminations, that it provided for rulers and sometimes for greater lords. Lesser fireworks were sold for use by others, but with dire warnings of the disaster that could result from attempting to learn what was inside them. The Guild once had chapter houses in Cairhien and Tanchico, but both are now destroyed. In addition, the members of the Guild in Tanchico resisted the invasion by the Seanchan and the survivors were made <em class="calibre4">da’covale</em>, and the Guild as such no longer exists. However, individual Illuminators have escaped Seanchan rule, and perhaps more grand displays will be seen in the not-too-distant future. <em class="calibre4">See also da’covale.</em></p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Ishara:</strong> The first Queen of Andor (<em class="calibre4">circa</em> FY 994–1020). At the death of Artur Hawkwing, Ishara convinced her husband, one of Hawkwing’s foremost generals, to raise the siege of Tar Valon and accompany her to Caemlyn with as many soldiers as he could break away from the army. Where others tried to seize the whole of Hawkwing’s empire and <a id="page_612" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>failed, Ishara took a firm hold on a small part and succeeded. Today, nearly every noble House in Andor contains some of Ishara’s blood, and the right to claim the Lion Throne depends both on direct descent from her and on the number of lines of connection to her that can be established.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para7"><strong class="calibre14">Kaensada:</strong> An area of Seanchan that is populated by less-than-civilized hill tribes. These tribes fight a great deal among themselves, as do individual families within the tribes. Each tribe has its own customs and taboos, the latter of which often make no sense to anyone outside that tribe. Most of the tribesmen avoid the more civilized residents of Seanchan.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Katar:</strong> A city in Arad Doman known for its mines and forges. Katar is wealthy enough that its Lords occasionally need reminding that they are part of Arad Doman.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Kin, the:</strong> Even during the Trolloc Wars, more than two thousand years ago (circa 1000–1350 AB), the White Tower continued to maintain its standards, putting out women who failed to measure up. One group of these women, fearing to return home in the midst of the wars, fled to Barashta (near the present-day site of Ebou Dar), as far from the fighting as was possible to go at that time. Calling themselves the Kin, and Kinswomen, they kept in hiding and offered a safe haven for others who had been put out. In time, their approaches to women told to leave the Tower led to contacts with runaways, and while the exact reasons may never be known, the Kin began to accept runaways, as well. They made great efforts to keep these girls from learning anything about the Kin until they were sure that Aes Sedai would not swoop down and retake them. After all, everyone knew that runaways were always caught sooner or later, and the Kin knew that unless they held themselves secret, they themselves would be punished severely.</p>
<p class="indent-parad">Unknown to the Kin, Aes Sedai in the Tower were aware of their existence almost from the very first, but prosecution of the wars left no time for dealing with them. By the end of the wars, the Tower realized that it might not be in their best interests to snuff out the Kin. Prior to that time, a majority of runaways actually had managed to escape, whatever the Tower’s propaganda, but once the Kin began helping them, the Tower knew exactly where any runaway was heading, and they began retaking nine out of ten. Since Kinswomen moved in and out of Barashta (and later Ebou Dar) in an effort to hide their existence and their numbers, never staying more than ten years lest someone <a id="page_613" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>notice that they did not age at a normal speed, the Tower believed they were few, and they certainly were keeping themselves low. In order to use the Kin as a trap for runaways, the Tower decided to leave them alone, unlike any other similar group in history, and to keep the very existence of the Kin a secret known only to full Aes Sedai.</p>
<p class="indent-parad">The Kin do not have laws, but rather rules (called “the Rule”) based in part on the rules for novices and Accepted in the White Tower, and in part on the necessity of maintaining secrecy. As might be expected given the origins of the Kin, they maintain the Rule very firmly on all of their members.</p>
<p class="indent-parad">Recent open contacts between Aes Sedai and Kinswomen, while known only to a handful of sisters, have produced a number of shocks, including the facts that there are twice as many Kinswomen as Aes Sedai and that some have lived more than a hundred years longer than any Aes Sedai who has lived since before the Trolloc Wars. The effect of these revelations, both on Aes Sedai and on Kinswomen, is as yet a matter for speculation. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Daughters of Silence, the; Knitting Circle, the.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Knitting Circle, the:</strong> The leaders of the Kin. Since no member of the Kin has ever known how Aes Sedai arrange their own hierarchy—knowledge passed on only when an Accepted has passed her test for the shawl—they put no store in strength in the Power but give great weight to age, with the older woman always standing above the younger. The Knitting Circle (a title chosen, like the Kin, because it is innocuous) thus consists of the thirteen oldest Kinswomen resident in Ebou Dar, with the oldest given the title of Eldest. By the rules, all will have to step down when it is time for them to move on, but so long as they are resident in Ebou Dar, they have supreme authority over the Kin, to a degree that any Amyrlin Seat would envy. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Kin, the.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para7"><strong class="calibre14">Lady of the Shadows:</strong> A Seanchan term for death.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Lance-Captain:</strong> In most lands, noblewomen do not personally lead their armsmen into battle under normal circumstances. Instead, they hire a professional soldier, almost always a commoner, who is responsible for both training and leading their armsmen. Depending on the land, this man can be called a Lance-Captain, Sword-Captain, Master of the Horse, or Master of the Lances. Rumors of closer relationships than lady and servant often spring up, perhaps inevitably. Sometimes they are true.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Legion of the Dragon, the:</strong> A large military formation, all infantry, giving allegiance to the Dragon Reborn, trained by Davram Bashere <a id="page_614" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>along lines worked out by himself and Mat Cauthon, lines which depart sharply from the usual employment of foot. While many men simply walk in to volunteer, large numbers of the Legion are scooped up by recruiting parties from the Black Tower, who first gather all of the men in an area who are willing to follow the Dragon Reborn, and only after taking them through gateways near Caemlyn winnow out those who can be taught to channel. The remainder, by far the greater number, are sent to Bashere’s training camps.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para7"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">marath’damane</em>:</strong> In the Old Tongue, “those who must be leashed,” and also “one who must be leashed.” The term applied by the Seanchan to any woman capable of channeling who has not been collared as a <em class="calibre4">damane</em>.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">Mera’din</em>:</strong> In the Old Tongue, “the Brotherless.” The name adopted, as a society, by those Aiel who abandoned clan and sept and went to the Shaido because they could not accept Rand al’Thor, a wetlander, as the <em class="calibre4">Car’a’carn,</em> or because they refused to accept his revelations concerning the history and origins of the Aiel. Deserting clan and sept for any reason is anathema among the Aiel, therefore their own warrior societies among the Shaido were unwilling to take them in, and they formed this society, the Brotherless.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">morat-</em>:</strong> In the Old Tongue, “handler.” Among the Seanchan, it is used for those who handle exotics, such as <em class="calibre4">morat’raken</em>, a <em class="calibre4">raken</em> handler or rider, also informally called a flier. <em class="calibre4">See also der’morat-</em>.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para7"><strong class="calibre14">Prophet, the:</strong> More formally, the Prophet of the Lord Dragon. Once known as Masema Dagar, a Shienaran soldier, he underwent a revelation and decided that he had been called to spread the word of the Dragon’s Rebirth. He believes that nothing—nothing!—is more important than acknowledging the Dragon Reborn as the Light made flesh and being ready when the Dragon Reborn calls, and he and his followers will use any means to force others to sing the glories of the Dragon Reborn. Forsaking any name but “the Prophet,” he has brought chaos to much of Ghealdan and Amadicia, large parts of which he controls. He joined with Perrin Aybara, who was sent to bring him to <a id="page_615" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>Rand, and has, for reasons unknown, stayed with him even though this delays his going to the Dragon Reborn.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para7"><strong class="calibre14">Queen’s Guards, the:</strong> The elite military formation in Andor. In peacetime the Guard is responsible for upholding the Queen’s law and keeping the peace. The uniform of the Queen’s Guard includes a red undercoat, gleaming mail and plate armor, a brilliant red cloak, and a conical helmet with a barred visor. High-ranking officers wear knots of rank on their shoulder, and may wear golden lion-head spurs. A recent addition to the Queen’s Guard is the Daughter-Heir’s personal bodyguard, which is composed entirely of women with the sole exception of its captain, Doilin Mellar.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Questioners, the:</strong> An order within the Children of the Light. They refer to themselves as the Hand of the Light, and their avowed purposes are to discover the truth in disputations and uncover Darkfriends. In the search for truth and the Light, their normal method of inquiry is torture, their normal manner that they know the truth already and must only make their victim confess to it. At times they act as if they are entirely separate from the Children and the Council of the Anointed, which commands the Children. The head of the Questioners is the High Inquisitor, at present Rhadam Asunawa, who sits on the Council of the Anointed. Their sign is a blood-red shepherd’s crook.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para7"><strong class="calibre14">Redarms:</strong> Soldiers of the Band of the Red Hand, who have been chosen out for temporary police duty to make sure that other soldiers of the Band cause no trouble or damage in a town or village. So named because, while on duty, they wear very broad red armbands that almost cover their entire sleeves. Usually chosen from among the most experienced and reliable men. Since any damages must be paid for by the men serving as Redarms, they work hard to make sure all is quiet and peaceful. A number of former Redarms were chosen to accompany Mat Cauthon to Ebou Dar. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Band of the Red Hand.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para7"><strong class="calibre14">Sea Folk hierarchy:</strong> The Atha’an Miere, the Sea Folk, are ruled by the Mistress of the Ships to the Atha’an Miere. She is assisted by the Windfinder to the Mistress of the Ships, and by the Master of the Blades. Below this come the clan Wavemistresses, each assisted by her Windfinder and her Swordmaster. Below her are the Sailmistresses <a id="page_616" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>(ship captains) of her clan, each assisted by her Windfinder and her Cargomaster. The Windfinder to the Mistress of the Ships has authority over all Windfinders to clan Wavemistresses, who in turn have authority over all the Windfinders of her clan. Likewise, the Master of the Blades has authority over all Swordmasters, and they in turn over the Cargomasters of their clans. Rank is not hereditary among the Sea Folk. The Mistress of the Ships is chosen, for life, by the First Twelve of the Atha’an Miere, the twelve most senior clan Wavemistresses. A clan Wavemistress is elected by the twelve most senior Sailmistresses of her clan, called simply the First Twelve, a term which is also used to designate the senior Sailmistresses present anywhere. She can also be removed by a vote of her clan’s First Twelve. In fact, anyone other than the Mistress of the Ships can be demoted, even all the way down to deckhand, for malfeasance, cowardice or other crimes. Also, the Windfinder to a Wavemistress or Mistress of the Ship who dies will, of necessity, have to serve a lower ranking woman, and her own rank thus decreases.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Seandar:</strong> The Imperial capital of Seanchan, located in the northeast of the Seanchan continent. It is also the largest city in the Empire.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Seekers:</strong> More formally, Seekers for Truth, they are a police/spy organization of the Seanchan Imperial Throne. Although most Seekers are <em class="calibre4">da’covale</em> and the property of the Imperial family, they have wide-ranging powers. Even one of the Blood can be arrested for failure to answer any question put by a Seeker, or for failure to cooperate fully with a Seeker, this last defined by the Seekers themselves, subject only to review by the Empress. Those Seekers who are <em class="calibre4">da’covale</em> are marked on either shoulder with a raven and a tower. Unlike the Deathwatch Guards, Seekers are seldom eager to show their ravens, in part because it necessitates revealing who and what they are.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">sei’mosiev</em>:</strong> In the Old Tongue, “lowered eyes,” or “downcast eyes.” Among the Seanchan, to say that one has “become <em class="calibre4">sei’mosiev</em>” means that one has “lost face.” <em class="calibre4">See also sei’taer.</em></p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">sei’taer</em>:</strong> In the Old Tongue, “straight eyes,” or “level eyes.” Among the Seanchan, it refers to honor or face, to the ability to meet someone’s eyes. It is possible to “be” or “have” <em class="calibre4">sei’taer</em>, meaning that one has honor and face, and also to “gain” or “lose” <em class="calibre4">sei’taer</em>. <em class="calibre4">See also sei’mosiev</em>.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Shara:</strong> A mysterious land that lies to the east of the Aiel Waste. The land is protected both by inhospitable natural features and by man-made walls. Little is known about Shara, as the people of that land appear to <a id="page_617" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>work to keep their culture secret. The Sharans deny that the Trolloc Wars touched them, despite Aiel statements to the contrary. They deny knowledge of Artur Hawkwing’s attempted invasion, despite the accounts of eyewitnesses from the Sea Folk. The little information that has leaked out reveals that the Sharans are ruled by a single absolute monarch, a Sh’boan if a woman and a Sh’botay if a man. That monarch rules for exactly seven years, then dies. The rule then passes to the mate of that ruler, who rules for seven years and then dies. This pattern has repeated itself since the time of the Breaking of the World. The Sharans believe that the deaths are the “Will of the Pattern.”</p>
<p class="indent-parad">There are channelers in Shara, known as the Ayyad, who are tattooed on their faces at birth. The women of the Ayyad enforce the laws regarding the Ayyad stringently. A sexual relationship between Ayyad and non-Ayyad is punishable by death for the non-Ayyad, and the Ayyad is also executed if force on his or her part can be proven. If a child is born of the union, it is left exposed to the elements, and dies. Male Ayyad are used as breeding stock only. When they reach their twenty-first year or begin to channel, whichever comes first, they are killed by Ayyad women and the body cremated. Supposedly, the Ayyad channel the One Power only at the command of the Sh’boan or Sh’botay, who is always surrounded by Ayyad women.</p>
<p class="indent-parad">Even the name of the land is in doubt. The natives have been known to call it many different names, including Shamara, Co’dansin, Tomaka, Kigali, and Shibouya.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">Shen an Calhar</em>:</strong> In the Old Tongue, “the Band of the Red Hand.” (1) A legendary group of heroes who had many exploits, finally dying in the defense of Manetheren when that land was destroyed during the Trolloc Wars.

They are <em class="calibre4">da’covale</em>, property, <a id="page_618" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>yet occupy positions of considerable authority and often power.

The meeting can be within or between <em class="calibre4">stedding.</em> It is presided over by the Council of Elders of a <em class="calibre4">stedding</em>, but any adult Ogier may speak, or may choose an advocate to speak for him. A Stump is often held at the largest tree stump in a <em class="calibre4">stedding,</em> and may last for several years. When a question arises that affects all Ogier, a Great Stump is held, and Ogier from all <em class="calibre4">stedding</em> meet to address the question.

<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Taborwin, Dobraine:</strong> A lord in Cairhien. He currently serves as Steward for the Dragon Reborn in Cairhien.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Tarabon:</strong> A nation on the Aryth Ocean. Once a great trading nation, a source of rugs, dyes and the Guild of Illuminators’ fireworks among other things, Tarabon has fallen on hard times. Racked by anarchy and civil war compounded by simultaneous wars against Arad Doman and the Dragonsworn, it was ripe for the picking when the Seanchan arrived. It is now firmly under Seanchan control; the chapter house of the Guild of Illuminators has been destroyed and most Illuminators themselves made <em class="calibre4">da’covale</em>. Most Taraboners appear grateful that the Seanchan have restored order, and since the Seanchan allow them to continue living their lives with minimal interference, they have no desire to bring on more warfare by trying to chase the Seanchan out. There are, however, some lords and soldiers who remain outside the Seanchan sphere of influence and hope to reclaim their land.</p>

This is the Wild Hunt. It is believed by many that merely seeing the Wild Hunt pass means imminent death, either for the viewer or for someone dear to the viewer. It is held to be especially dangerous to meet the Wild Hunt at a crossroads, just before sunrise or just after sunset. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Darkhounds.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Winged Guards, the:</strong> The personal bodyguards of the First of Mayene, and the elite military formation of Mayene. Members of the Winged Guards wear red-painted breastplates and red helmets shaped like rimmed pots that come down to the napes of their necks in the back, and carry red-streamered lances. Officers have wings worked on the sides of their helmets, and rank is denoted by slender plumes.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para8"><strong class="calibre14">Wise Woman:</strong> Honorific used in Ebou Dar for women famed for their incredible abilities at healing almost any injury. A Wise Woman is traditionally marked by a red belt. While some have noted that many, indeed most, Ebou Dari Wise Women were not even from Altara, much less Ebou Dar, what was not known until recently, and still is known only to a few, is that all Wise Women are in fact Kinswomen and use various versions of Healing, giving out herbs and poultices only as a cover. With the flight of the Kin from Ebou Dar after the Seanchan took the city, no Wise Women remain there. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Kin, the.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para7"><strong class="calibre14">Younglings, the:</strong> The first Younglings were young men studying under the Warders at the White Tower. They fought against their teachers who attempted to free Siuan Sanche after she was deposed from the Amyrlin Seat. Led by Gawyn Trakand, the Younglings remained loyal to the White Tower, and fought skirmishes against Whitecloaks under Eamon Valda. They accompanied Elaida’s embassy to the Dragon Reborn in Cairhien and saw action against the Aiel and Asha’man at Dumai’s Wells. On their return to Tar Valon, they found themselves barred from the city.</p>
<p class="indent-parad">The Younglings wear green cloaks with Gawyn’s White Boar; those who fought against their teachers in Tar Valon wear a small silver tower on their collars. They accept recruits wherever they go, but they do not take veterans or older men. One requirement is that the recruit must be willing to put aside all loyalties except to the Younglings. Older <a id="page_620" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>members teach the new recruits Warder techniques since they have given over accepting instruction from Warders, and several have refused offers of bonding from Aes Sedai. In many ways they hardly seem attached to the Tower and Aes Sedai at all. This is a result in part of their suspicion that they were not meant to survive the expedition to Cairhien.</p>
