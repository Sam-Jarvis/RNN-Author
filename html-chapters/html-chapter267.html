<div class="subtitle-chapter"><span class="calibre2"><span class="calibre18">Need</span></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">F</span>or a moment Nynaeve stood in the Heart of the Stone not seeing it, not thinking of <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span> at all. Egeanin was Seanchan. One of those vile people who had put a collar on Egwene’s neck and tried to put one on hers. Knowing it still made her feel hollow. Seanchan, and she had snaked her way into Nynaeve’s affections. True friends had seemed so few and far between since leaving Emond’s Field. To find a new one, then lose her in this way . . . .</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I hate her for that worst of all,” she growled, folding her arms tightly. “She made me like her, and I cannot stop, and I hate her for it!” Said aloud, it made no sense at all. “I do not have to make sense.” She laughed quietly, with a rueful shake of her head. “I am supposed to be Aes Sedai.” But not to be wool-gathering like a fool girl.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> sparkled, the crystal sword rising out of the floorstones beneath the great dome, and the massive redstone columns ran off in shadowed rows through that odd, dim light that came from everywhere. Easy to remember the feel of being watched, to imagine it again. If it had been imagination before. If it was now. Anything might be hiding back in there. A good stout stick appeared in her hands as she peered among the columns. Where was Egwene? Just like the girl to keep her waiting. All that murkiness. For all she knew, something could be about to jump out at—</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“That is an odd dress, Nynaeve.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Just stifling a yelp, she spun around heavily, rattling metallically, heart thumping in her throat. Egwene stood on the other side of <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> with two women in bulky skirts and dark shawls over white blouses, snowy hair held by folded scarves falling to their waists. Nynaeve swallowed, hoping none of them noticed, tried to make herself breathe normally again. Sneaking up on her that way!</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">One of the Aiel women she knew from Elayne’s description; Amys’s face was much too young for such hair, but apparently it had been almost silver even as a child. The other, thin and bony, had pale blue eyes in a leathery, wrinkled face. That must be Bair. The tougher of the two, in Nynaeve’s opinion now that she saw them, not that this Amys looked very—Odd dress? <span class="calibre18">I rattled?</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Staring down at herself, she gasped. Her dress looked vaguely like a Two Rivers garment; if Two Rivers women wore dresses fashioned from steel mail, with pieces of plate armor like those she had seen in Shienar. How did men run about and jump into saddles in these things? It dragged at her shoulders as if it weighed a hundred pounds. The good stick was metal now, and spiked at the end like a shiny steel sandburr. Without touching her head she knew she had on some sort of helmet. Blushing furiously, she concentrated, changed it all to good Two Rivers woolens and a walking staff. It felt good to have her hair back in one proper braid, hanging over her shoulder.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Uncontrolled thoughts are troublesome when you walk the dream,” Bair said in a thin, strong voice. “You must learn to control them if you mean to continue.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I can control my thoughts very well, thank you,” Nynaeve said crisply. “I—” Bair’s voice was not all that was thin. The Two Wise Ones seemed . . . misty, almost, and Egwene, in a pale blue riding dress, was very nearly transparent. “What’s the matter with you? Why do you look that way?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You try entering <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span> while half-asleep in a saddle,” Egwene said dryly. She seemed to flicker. “It is morning in the Three-fold Land, and we are on the move. I had to talk Amys into letting me come at all, but I was afraid you would be worried.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It is a difficult enough task without the horse,” Amys said, “sleeping shallowly when you wish to be awake. Egwene has not learned it entirely yet.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I will,” Egwene said with an irritated determination. She was always too hasty and stubborn in her desire to learn; if these Wise Ones did not
hold on to the scruff of her neck she would very likely jump into all sorts of trouble.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nynaeve stopped worrying about Egwene and trouble as the younger woman began to speak of Trollocs and Draghkar attacking Cold Rocks Hold. Seana, a Wise One dreamwalker, among the dead. Rand hurrying the Taardad Aiel toward this Alcair Dal, apparently in violation of all custom, sending out runners to bring more septs. The boy was confiding his intentions to no one, the Aiel were jumpy, and Moiraine was ready to bite the heads off nails. Moiraine’s frustration would have been some relief—she had hoped he could escape that woman’s influence somehow—if Egwene had not frowned so worriedly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I don’t know whether it is madness or design,” Egwene finished. “I could almost bear it either way if I knew. Nynaeve, I’ll admit it isn’t prophecy, or Tarmon Gai’don, that makes me anxious right now. Maybe it is foolish, but I promised Elayne to look after him, and I do not know how.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nynaeve walked around the crystal sword to put an arm around her. At least she felt solid, even if she did look a reflection in a foggy mirror. Rand’s sanity. There was nothing she could do about that, no comfort she could offer. Egwene was the one there to see him. “The best you can do for Elayne is to tell him to read what she wrote. She worries about it sometimes; she won’t talk, but I think she’s afraid she said more than she should have. If he believes she is totally besotted, he’s more likely to feel the same, which will not hurt her in the least. At least we have some good news in Tanchico. Some.” When she explained, though, it barely seemed to justify “some.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“So you still don’t know what it is they’re after,” Egwene said after she finished, “but even if you did, they are on top of it and still might find it first.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Not if I can help it.” Nynaeve fixed the two Wise Ones with a firm, level look. From what Elayne said of Amys’s reluctance to give anything but warnings, she would need firmness to deal with them. The pair was so hazy a strong puff might blow them away like fog. “Elayne thinks you know all sorts of tricks with dreams. Is there any way I could get into Amathera’s dreams to see if she is a Darkfriend?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Foolish girl.” Bair’s long hair swung as she shook her head. “If Aes Sedai, a foolish girl still. To step into another’s dream is very dangerous unless she knows you and expects you. It is <span class="calibre18">her</span> dream, not as here. There, this Amathera will control all. Even you.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She had been sure that was the way. It was irritating to learn differently. And “foolish girl”?</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I am not a girl,” she snapped. She wanted to yank her braid, but clenched a fist at her side instead; for some reason, pulling at her hair felt strangely uncomfortable of late. “I was Wisdom of Emond’s Field before I . . . became Aes Sedai . . .” She hardly stumbled over the lie at all now. “ . . . and I told women as old as you when to sit down and be quiet. If you know how to help me, say so instead of giving me <span class="calibre18">foolish</span> maunderings about what is dangerous. I know danger when I see it.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Abruptly she realized her single braid had split in two, one over each ear, red ribbons woven through to make tassels on the ends. Her skirt was so short it showed her knees, she wore a loose white blouse like the Wise Ones, and her shoes and stockings were gone. Where had <span class="calibre18">this</span> come from? She had surely never thought of wearing anything like it. Egwene put a hasty hand over her mouth. Was she aghast? Surely not smiling.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Uncontrolled thoughts,” Amys said, “can be very troublesome indeed, Nynaeve Sedai, until you learn.” Despite her bland tone, her lips quirked in barely masked amusement.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nynaeve kept her face smooth with an effort. They could not have had anything to do with it. <span class="calibre18">They can’t have!</span> She struggled to change back, and it <span class="calibre18">was</span> a struggle, as though something held her as she was. Her cheeks grew hotter and hotter. Suddenly, just at the point when she was ready to break down and ask advice, or even help, her clothes and hair were as they had been. She wriggled her toes gratefully in good stout shoes. It <span class="calibre18">had</span> just been some odd, stray thought. In any case, she was not about to voice any suspicions; they looked far too amused as it was, even Egwene. <span class="calibre18">I am not here for some fool contest. I just won’t dignify them.</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“If I cannot enter her dream, can I bring her into the World of Dreams? I need some way to talk to her.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We would not teach you that if we knew how,” Amys said, hitching her shawl angrily. “It is an evil thing you ask, Nynaeve Sedai.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“She would be as helpless here as you in her dream.” Bair’s thin voice sounded like an iron rod. “It has been handed down among dreamwalkers since the first that no one must ever be <span class="calibre18">brought</span> into the dream. It is said that that was the way of the Shadow in the last days of the Age of Legends.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nynaeve shifted her feet under those hard stares; realizing she had an arm around Egwene, she held still. She was not about to let Egwene think they had made her uneasy. Not that they had. If she thought of being
hauled before the Women’s Circle before she was chosen Wisdom, it was nothing at all to do with the Wise Ones. Firmness was what was . . . . They stared at her. Hazy or not, these women could duel Siuan Sanche stare for stare. Especially Bair. Not that they intimidated her, but she could see the point of being reasonable. “Elayne and I need help. The Black Ajah is sitting on top of something that can harm Rand. If they find it before we do, they may be able to control him. We need to find it first. If there is anything you can do to help, anything you can tell me . . . . Anything at all.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Aes Sedai,” Amys said, “you can make a request for help sound a demand.” Nynaeve’s mouth tightened—demand? She had all but begged. Demand, indeed!—but the Aiel woman did not seem to notice. Or chose to ignore it. “Yet a danger to Rand al’Thor . . . . We cannot allow the Shadow to have that. There is a way.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Dangerous.” Bair shook her head vigorously. “This young woman knows less than Egwene did when she came to us. It is too dangerous for her.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Then maybe I could—” Egwene began, and the two cut her off as one.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You are going to complete your training; you are too eager to go beyond what you know,” Bair said sharply at the same time Amys said, not the slightest bit softer, “You are not there in Tanchico, you do not know the place, and you cannot have Nynaeve’s need. She is the hunter.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Under those iron eyes, Egwene subsided sulkily, and the two Wise Ones looked at each other. Finally Bair shrugged and lifted her shawl up around her face; clearly she washed her hands of the entire matter.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It is dangerous,” Amys said. They made it sound as if breathing was dangerous in <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod.</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I—!” Nynaeve cut off as Amys’s eyes actually grew harder; she would not have thought it possible. Keeping a firm image of her clothes as they were—of course they had had nothing to do with that; it simply seemed wise to make sure her dress remained as it was—she changed what she had been going to say. “I will be careful.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It is not possible,” Amys told her flatly, “but I do not know another way. Need is the key. When there are too many people for the hold, the sept must divide, and the need is for water at the new hold. If no location with water is known, one of us may be called to find one. The key then is the need for a proper valley or canyon, not too far from the first, with water. Concentrating on that need will bring you near to what you want.
Concentrating on the need again will bring you closer. Each step brings you nearer, until at last you are not only in the valley, but standing beside where water is to be found. It may be harder for you, because you do not know exactly what you are seeking, though the depth of need may make up for it. And you know already in a rough fashion where it lies, in this palace.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The danger is this, and you must be aware of it.” The Wise One leaned toward her intently, driving her words home with a tone as sharp as her gaze. “Each step is made blind, with eyes closed. You cannot know where you will be when you open your eyes. And finding the water does no good if you are standing in a den of vipers. The fangs of a mountain king kill as quickly in the dream as waking. I think these women Egwene speaks of will kill more quickly than the snake.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I did that,” Egwene exclaimed. Nynaeve felt her jump as the Aiel women’s eyes went to her. “Before I met you,” she said hastily. “Before we went to Tear.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Need. Nynaeve felt warmer toward the Aiel women now that one of them had given her something she could use. “You must keep a close eye on Egwene,” she told them, hugging the younger woman to show she meant it fondly. “You are right, Bair. She will try to do more than she knows how. She has always been that way.” For some reason Bair arched a white eyebrow at <span class="calibre18">her.</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I do not find her so,” Amys said in a dry voice. “She is a biddable student, now. Is that not so, Egwene?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene’s mouth set in a stubborn line. These Wise Ones did not know her well if they believed a Two Rivers woman would call herself biddable. On the other hand, she did not say anything. That was unexpected. As hard a lot as Aes Sedai, it appeared, these Aielwomen.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Her hour was slipping away, and impatience bubbled to try this method now; if Elayne woke her, it might take hours to get back to sleep. “In seven days,” she said, “one of us will meet you here again.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene nodded. “In seven days, Rand will have shown himself to the clan chiefs as He Who Comes With the Dawn, and the Aiel will all be behind him.” The Wise Ones’ eyes shifted slightly, and Amys adjusted her shawl; Egwene did not see it. “The Light knows what he means to do then.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“In seven days,” Nynaeve said, “Elayne and I will have taken whatever Liandrin is hunting away from the lot of them.” Or else, very likely, the
Black Ajah would have it. So the Wise Ones were not more certain the Aiel would follow Rand than Egwene was of his plans. No certainty anywhere. But no point in burdening Egwene with more doubts, either. “When one of us sees you next, we’ll have laid them by the heels and stuffed them all in sacks to cart to the Tower for trial.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Try to be careful, Nynaeve. I know you don’t know how to, but try anyway. Tell Elayne I said so, too. She isn’t as . . . bold . . . as you are, but she can come close.” Amys and Bair each laid a hand on Egwene’s shoulder, and they were gone.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Try to be careful? Fool girl. She was always careful. What had Egwene been about to say rather than bold? Nynaeve folded her arms tightly in lieu of pulling her braid. Maybe better she did not know.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She realized she had not told Egwene about Egeanin. Perhaps best not to stir up Egwene’s memories of her captivity. Nynaeve could remember all too well the other woman’s nightmares for weeks after she was freed, waking up screaming that she would not be chained. Much the best to let it lie. It was not as if Egwene need ever meet the Seanchan woman. <span class="calibre18">Burn that woman! Burn Egeanin to ash! Burn her!</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“This is not using my time wisely,” she said aloud. The words echoed through the tall columns. With the other women gone, they looked even more foreboding than before, more a hiding place for unseen watchers and things that jumped out at you. Time to be away.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">First, though, she changed her hair to a tassel of long narrow braids, her dress to clinging folds of dark green silk. A transparent veil covered her mouth and nose, fluttering slightly when she breathed. With a grimace she added beads of green jade woven into the thin plaits. Should any of the Black sisters be using their stolen <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal</span> to enter the World of Dreams and see her in the Panarch’s Palace, they would think her only a Taraboner woman who had dreamed herself there in more ordinary fashion. Some knew her by sight, though. Lifting a handful of bead-strung braids, she smiled. Pale honey. She had not realized that was possible. <span class="calibre18">I wonder what I look like. Could they still know me?</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Suddenly a tall stand-mirror stood beside <span class="calibre18">Callandor.</span> In the glass, her big brown eyes widened in shock, her rosebud of a mouth fell open. She had Rendra’s face! Her features flickered back and forth, eyes and hair flashing darker then lighter; straining, she settled them as the innkeeper’s. No one would know her now. And Egwene thought she did not know how to be careful.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Closing her eyes, she concentrated on Tanchico, on the Panarch’s Palace,
on need. Something dangerous to Rand, to the Dragon Reborn, need . . . . Around her, <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span> shifted; she <span class="calibre18">felt</span> it, a sliding lurch, and opened her eyes eagerly to see what she had found.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">It was a bedchamber, as big as any six at the Three Plum Court, the white plaster walls worked in painted friezes, golden lamps hanging from the ceiling by gilded chains. The tall posts of the bed spread carved limbs and leaves in a canopy above the mattresses. A woman well short of her middle years stood stiffly with her back to one of the posts at the foot of the bed; she was really quite lovely, in that pouty-mouthed way that Nynaeve herself had adopted. Atop her dark braids sat a crown of golden trefoil leaves among rubies and pearls with a moonstone larger than a goose egg, and around her neck hung a broad stole, dangling to her knees and embroidered along its length with trees. Aside from crown and stole she wore only a glistening coat of sweat.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Her tremulous eyes were fixed on the woman lying at her ease on a low couch. The second woman’s back was to Nynaeve, as misty as Egwene had been earlier. She was short and slight, dark hair flowing loose to her shoulders, wide-skirted gown of pale yellow silk definitely not Taraboner. Nynaeve did not have to see her face to know it had large blue eyes and a foxlike shape, or see the bonds of Air holding the woman against the bedpost to know she was looking at Temaile Kinderode.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“ . . . learn so much when you use your dreams instead of wasting sleep,” Temaile was saying with a Cairhienin accent, laughing. “Are you not enjoying yourself? What shall I teach you next? I know.  ‘I Have Loved a Thousand Sailor Men.’ ” She waggled an admonishing finger. “Be sure you learn all the words properly, Amathera. You know I would not want to—What are you gaping at?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Abruptly Nynaeve realized the woman against the bedpost—Amathera? The Panarch?—was staring straight at her. Temaile shifted lazily as though to turn her head.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nynaeve clamped her eyes shut. Need.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">Shift.</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Letting herself sag against the narrow column, Nynaeve gulped air as if she had run twenty miles, not even wondering where she was. Her heart pounded like a wild drum. Speak of landing in a vipers’ den. Temaile Kinderode. The Black sister Amico had said enjoyed causing pain, enjoyed it enough to have made one of the Black Ajah comment. And her not able to channel a spark. She could have ended up decorating a bedpost beside Amathera. <span class="calibre18">Light</span>! She shivered, seeing it. <span class="calibre18">Calm yourself, woman! You are out of
there, and even if Temaile saw you, she saw a honey-haired woman who vanished, just a Taraboner who dreamed herself into</span> Tel’aran’rhiod <span class="calibre18">for a moment.</span> Surely Temaile could not have been aware of her long enough to sense she could channel; even when she could not do it, the ability was there to be felt by one who shared it. Only a moment. Not long enough, with luck.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">At least she knew Amathera’s situation now. The woman was certainly no ally of Temaile. This method of searching had already repaid use. But not enough, not yet. Controlling her breathing as best she could, she looked around.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rows of the thin white columns ran the length and breadth of a huge chamber nearly as wide as it was long, with smooth polished white floorstones below and gilded bosses on the ceiling high above. A thick rope of white silk ran all the way around the room on waist-high posts of dark polished wood, except where it would have blocked the doorways with double-pointed arches. Stands and open cabinets lined the walls, and the bones of peculiar beasts, with more display cases out in the floor, also roped off. The main exhibition hall of the palace, from Egwene’s description. What she sought must be in this very chamber. Her next step would not be as blind as the first; there were certainly no vipers, no Temailes, here.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">A handsome woman suddenly appeared beside a glass case with four carved legs out in the middle of the floor. She was no Taraboner, with her dark hair falling in waves to her shoulders, yet that was not what made Nynaeve gape. The woman’s dress seemed to be mist, sometimes silvery and opaque, sometimes gray and so thin as to show her limbs and body clearly. From wherever she had dreamed herself here, she assuredly had a vivid imagination to conceive that! Even the scandalous Domani dresses she had heard of surely could not equal this.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The woman smiled at the glass case, then continued on up the hall, stopping on the far side to study something Nynaeve could not make out, something dark atop a white stone stand.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Frowning, Nynaeve released her grip on a fistful of honey-colored braids. The woman would disappear at any moment; few dreamed themselves into <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span> for long. Of course, it did not matter if the woman saw her; she was certainly no one on their list of Black sisters. And yet she seemed somehow . . . . Nynaeve realized she had taken hold of a handful of braids again. The woman . . . . Of its own accord her hand pulled—hard—and she stared at it in amazement; her knuckles were white, her hand quivering. It was almost as if thinking of that woman . . . . Arm shaking, her hand tried to yank her hair out of her scalp. <span class="calibre18">Why under the Light?</span></span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The mist-clad woman still stood in front of the distant white pedestal. Trembling spread from Nynaeve’s arm into her shoulder. She had certainly never seen the woman before. And yet . . . . She tried to open her fingers; they only clamped down harder. Surely she never had. Shivering from head to toe, she hugged herself with the one arm she had free. Surely . . . . Her teeth wanted to chatter. The woman seemed . . . . She wanted to weep. The woman . . . .</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Images burst into her head, exploding; she slumped against the column beside her as if they had physical force; her eyes bulged. She saw it again. The Chamber of Falling Blossoms, and that sturdily handsome woman surrounded by the glow of <span class="calibre18">saidar.</span> Herself and Elayne, babbling like children, fighting to be first to answer, pouring out everything they knew. How much had they told? It was difficult to bring out details, but she dimly remembered keeping some things back. Not because she wanted to; she would have told the woman anything, done anything she asked. Her face heated with shame, and anger. If she had managed to hide any scraps, it was only because she had been so—<span class="calibre18">eager</span>!—to answer the last question asked that she passed over earlier.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">It makes no sense</span>, a small voice said in the back of her head. <span class="calibre18">If she’s a Black sister I don’t know about, why did she not hand us over to Liandrin? She could have. We’d have gone with her like lambs.</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Cold rage would not let her listen. A Black sister had made her dance like a puppet and then told her to forget. Ordered her to forget. And she had! Well, now the woman would find out what it was like to face her ready and forewarned!</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Before she could reach for the True Source, Birgitte was suddenly beside the next column in that short white coat and wide yellow trousers gathered at the ankle. Birgitte, or some woman dreaming she was Birgitte, with golden hair in an elaborate braid. A warning finger pressed against her lips, she pointed at Nynaeve, then urgently toward one of the double-arched doorways behind them. Bright blue eyes compelling, she vanished.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nynaeve shook her head. Whoever the woman was, she had no time. Opening herself to <span class="calibre18">saidar</span>, she turned, filled to overflowing with the One Power and righteous wrath. The woman clothed in mist was gone. Gone! Because that golden-haired fool had distracted her! Perhaps that one was still about, waiting for her. Wrapped in the Power, she strode through the doorway the woman had indicated.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The golden-haired woman was waiting in a brightly carpeted hallway
where unlit golden lamps gave off the scent of perfumed oil. She held a silver bow now, and a quiver of silver arrows hung at her waist.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Who are you?” Nynaeve demanded furiously. She would give the woman a chance to explain herself. And then teach her a lesson she would not soon forget! “Are you the same fool who shot at me in the Waste, claiming she was Birgitte? I was about to teach a member of the Black Ajah manners when you let her get away!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I am Birgitte,” the woman said, leaning on her bow. “At least, that is the name you would know. And the lesson might have been yours, here as surely as in the Three-fold Land. I remember the lives I have lived as if they were books well-read, the longer gone dimmer than the nearer, but I remember well when I fought at Lews Therin’s side. I will never forget Moghedien’s face, any more than I will forget the face of Asmodean, the man you almost disturbed at Rhuidean.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Asmodean? Moghedien? That woman was one of the Forsaken? A Forsaken in Tanchico. And one at Rhuidean, in the Waste! Egwene would certainly have said something if she knew. No way to warn her, not for seven days. Anger—and <span class="calibre18">saidar</span>—surged in her. “What are you doing here? I know that you all vanished after the Horn of Valere called you, but you are . . . .” She trailed off, a trifle flustered at what she had been about to say, but the other woman calmly finished for her.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Dead? Those of us who are bound to the Wheel are not dead as others are dead. Where better for us to wait until the Wheel weaves us out in new lives than in the World of Dreams?” Birgitte laughed suddenly. “I begin to talk as if I were a philosopher. In almost every life I can remember I was born a simple girl who took up the bow. I am an archer, no more.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You’re the heroine of a hundred tales,” Nynaeve said. “And I saw what your arrows did at Falme. Seanchan channeling did not touch you. Birgitte, we face near a dozen of the Black Ajah. And one of the Forsaken as well, it seems. We could use your help.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The other woman grimaced, embarrassed and regretful. “I cannot, Nynaeve. I cannot touch the world of flesh unless the Horn calls me again. Or else the Wheel weaves me out. If it did this moment, you would find only an infant mewling at her mother’s breast. As for Falme, the Horn had called us; we were not there as you were, in the flesh. That is why the Power could not touch us. Here, <span class="calibre18">all</span> is part of the dream, and the One Power could destroy me as easily as you. More easily. I told you; I am an archer, a sometime soldier, no more.” Her complex golden braid swung as she shook her head. “I do not know why I am explaining. I should not even be talking to you.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Why not? You’ve spoken to me before. And Egwene thought she saw you. That was you, wasn’t it?” Nynaeve frowned. “How do you know my name? Do you just <span class="calibre18">know</span> things?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I know what I see and hear. I have watched you, and listened, whenever I could find you. You and the other two women, and the young man with his wolves. According to the precepts, we may speak to none who know they are in <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod.</span> And yet, evil walks the dream as well as the world of flesh; you who fight it attract me. Even knowing I can do almost nothing, I find myself wanting to help you. But I cannot. It violates the precepts, precepts which have held me for so many turns of the Wheel that in my oldest, faintest memories I know I had already lived a hundred times, or a thousand. Speaking to you violates precepts as strong as law.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It does,” said a harsh, male voice.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nynaeve jumped and almost lashed out with the Power. The man was dark and strongly muscled, with the long hilts of two swords thrusting above his shoulders as he strode the few paces from where he had appeared to Birgitte. With what she had heard from Birgitte, the swords were enough to name him as Gaidal Cain, but where fair, golden-haired Birgitte was as beautiful as in the stories, he was definitely not. In fact, he was perhaps as ugly a man as Nynaeve had ever seen, his face wide and flat, his heavy nose too big, and his mouth a gash, far too broad. Birgitte smiled at him, though; her touch on his cheek held more than fondness. It was a surprise to see he was the shorter. Stocky and muscled as he was, powerful in his movements, he gave the impression of being taller than he was.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We have almost always been linked,” Birgitte told Nynaeve without taking her eyes from Cain’s. “He is usually born well before me—so I know my time approaches again when I cannot find him—and I usually hate him at first sight in the flesh. But we nearly always end lovers or wed. A simple story, but I think we have spun it out in a thousand variations.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Cain ignored Nynaeve as though she did not exist. “The precepts exist for a reason, Birgitte. Nothing but strife and trouble has ever come from breaking them.” His voice was indeed harsh, Nynaeve realized. Not at all like that of the man in the stories.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Perhaps I cannot sit by while evil fights,” Birgitte said quietly. “Or perhaps I simply hunger for the flesh again. It has been long since we were born last. The Shadow rises again, Gaidal. It rises here. We must fight it. That is the reason we were bound to the Wheel.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“When the Horn calls us, we will fight. When the Wheel weaves us,
we will fight. Not until then!” He glowered at her. “Have you forgotten what Moghedien promised you when we followed Lews Therin? I saw her, Birgitte. She will know you here.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Birgitte turned to Nynaeve. “I will aid you as I can, but do not expect too much. <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span> is the whole of my world, and I can do less here than you.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nynaeve blinked; the dark, heavy man had not moved that she had seen, but he suddenly stood two paces away, drawing a honing stone along one of his swords with a soft, silky rasp. Plainly, as far as he was concerned, Birgitte was speaking to the air.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What can you tell of Moghedien, Birgitte? I must know what I can, to face her.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Leaning on her bow, Birgitte frowned thoughtfully. “Facing Moghedien is difficult, and not only because she is Forsaken. She hides and takes no risks. She attacks only where she sees weakness, and moves only in shadows. If she fears defeat, she will run; she is not one to fight to the last, even when doing so has the chance of victory. A chance is not enough for Moghedien. But do not take her lightly. She is a serpent coiled in high grass, waiting her own moment to strike, with less compassion than the snake. Especially here do not take her lightly. Lanfear always claimed <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span> for her own, but Moghedien could do things here far beyond Lanfear, though she has not Lanfear’s strength in the world of flesh. I think she would not take the risk of confronting Lanfear.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nynaeve shivered, fear warring with the anger that let her contain the Power. Moghedien. Lanfear. This woman spoke so casually of the Forsaken. “Birgitte, what did Moghedien promise you?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“She knew what I was, even though I did not. How, I do not know.” Birgitte glanced at Cain; he appeared absorbed in his sword, but she lowered her voice anyway. “She promised to make me weep alone for as long as the Wheel turns. She said it as a fact that simply had not happened yet.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“And yet you are willing to help.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“As I can, Nynaeve. Remember that I told you not to expect too much.” Once more she looked at the man sharpening his sword. “We will meet again, Nynaeve. If you are careful, and survive.” Hefting her silver bow, she went to put an arm around Cain’s shoulders and murmur in his ear. Whatever she said, Cain was laughing as they vanished.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nynaeve shook her head. Careful. Everybody was telling her to be careful. A legendary hero who said she would help, only there was not much she could do. And one of the Forsaken in Tanchico.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The thought of Moghedien, of what the woman had done to her, strengthened her anger until the One Power pulsed in her like the sun. Abruptly she was back in the great hall where she had been standing before, almost hoping the woman had returned. But the hall was empty of life except for herself. Fury and the Power roared through her till she thought her skin would crisp and blacken. Moghedien, or any of the Black sisters, could sense her far more easily holding the Power than without, but she held it anyway. She almost wanted them to find her, so she could strike at them. Temaile was very likely still in <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod.</span> If she went back up to that bedchamber, she could settle Temaile once and for all. She could settle Temaile—and warn the rest. It was enough to make her growl.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">What had Moghedien been smiling at? Striding out to the case, a wide glass box atop a carved table, she peered in. Six mismatched figurines stood in a circle beneath the glass. A foot-tall nude woman balanced on the toes of one foot, dancing, all flowing lines, and a shepherd less than half as large, playing the pipes with his crook on his shoulder and a sheep at his feet, were as similar as any two. She had no doubt what had attracted the Forsaken’s smile, though.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">In the center of the circle a red-lacquered wooden stand held a disc as big as a man’s hand, divided into halves by a sinuous line, one side gleaming whiter than snow, the other blacker than pitch. It was made of <span class="calibre18">cuendillar</span>, she knew; she had seen its like, and only seven had ever been made. One of the seals on the Dark One’s prison; a focus for one of the locks that held him away from the world in Shayol Ghul. This was perhaps as important a discovery as whatever it was that threatened Rand. This had to be gotten away from the Black Ajah.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Suddenly she became aware of her reflection. The top of the case was the finest glass, without bubbles, and gave an image as clear as a mirror, if fainter. Dark green folds of silk draped her body so they showed every curve of breast and hip and thigh. Long honey braids full of jade beads framed a face with big brown eyes and a pouting mouth. The glow of <span class="calibre18">saidar</span> did not show, of course. Disguised so she did not even know herself, she walked about carrying a painted sign that screamed Aes Sedai.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I <span class="calibre18">can</span> be careful,” she muttered. Yet she held on a moment longer. The Power filling her was like life bubbling along her limbs, all the pleasures she had ever known seeping through her flesh. In the end, feeling foolish took enough edge from her anger to allow her to let go. Or maybe it dulled her anger to where she could no longer hold on.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Whatever the reason, it did not help her search. What she was after had to be somewhere in this huge hall among all these displays. Pulling her eyes away from what looked like the bones of a toothy lizard ten paces long, she closed them. Need. Danger to the Dragon Reborn, to Rand. Need.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">Shift.</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She was standing inside the white silk rope along the walls, the edge of a white stone pedestal touching her dress. What lay on top did not look very dangerous at first glance—a necklace and two bracelets of jointed black metal—but she could come no closer to anything than this. <span class="calibre18">Not without sitting on it</span>, she thought wryly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She stretched her hand out to touch it—<span class="calibre18">Pain. Sorrow. Suffering</span>—and jerked it back, gasping, the raw emotions still echoing in her head. Even her faint doubts vanished. This was what the Black Ajah was hunting. And if it still sat on this pedestal in <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span>, it sat there in the waking world, too. She had beaten them. This white stone pedestal.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Whirling around, she stared toward the glass case that held the <span class="calibre18">cuendillar</span> seal, located the place she had been standing where she first saw Moghedien. The woman had been looking at this pedestal, at the bracelets and collar. Moghedien had to know. But . . . .</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Everything around her spun and blurred, fading.</span></div>
<div class="p-blanc"><span class="calibre22"> <br class="calibre8"/></span></div>
<div class="p-blanc"><span class="calibre22"> <br class="calibre8"/></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="calibre22">“Wake up, Nynaeve,” Elayne muttered, suppressing a yawn as she shook the sleeping woman’s shoulders. “It has to be an hour by now. I want some sleep, too. Wake up, or I’ll see how you like your head in a bucket of water.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nynaeve’s eyes popped open, staring up at her. “If she knows what it is, why hasn’t she given it to them? If they know who <span class="calibre18">she</span> is, why does she have to look at it in <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span>? Is she hiding from them, too?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What are you talking about?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Braids tossing about as she wriggled up to sit with her back against the head of the bed, Nynaeve jerked her silk shift down. “I will tell you what I am talking about.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne’s mouth fell open as Nynaeve unfolded the tale of what her meeting with Egwene had become. Searching with need. Moghedien. Birgitte and Gaidal Cain. The black metal necklace and bracelets. Asmodean in the Waste. One of the seals on the Dark One’s prison in the Panarch’s
Palace. Elayne sank down weakly onto the side of the mattress long before Nynaeve came to Temaile and the Panarch, thrown in almost as an afterthought. And changing her appearance, masquerading as Rendra. If Nynaeve’s face had not been grimly serious, Elayne could have thought it one of Thom’s wilder stories.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egeanin, sitting up cross-legged in her linen shift, hands on knees, looked close to disbelieving. Elayne hoped Nynaeve did not start a row because she had loosed the woman’s wrists.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moghedien. That was the most horrifying part. One of the Forsaken in Tanchico. One of the Forsaken weaving the Power around the two of them, making them tell her everything. Elayne could not remember a bit of it. The thought was enough to press both her hands to a suddenly queasy stomach. “I don’t know whether Moghedien”—<span class="calibre18">Light, could she really have just walked in and made us . . . ?</span>—“is hiding from Liandrin and the others, Nynaeve. It sounds like what Birgitte”—<span class="calibre18">Light</span>, Birgitte <span class="calibre18">giving her advice</span>!—“said of her.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Whatever Moghedien is up to,” Nynaeve said in a tight voice, “I mean to pick a bone clean with her.” She slumped back against the flower-carved headboard. “In any case, we have to get the seal away from them as well as this necklace and bracelets.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne shook her head. “How can jewelry be dangerous to Rand? Are you sure? Are they a <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal</span> of some sort? What did they look like exactly?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“They looked like a necklace and bracelets,” Nynaeve snapped in exasperation. “Two jointed bracelets made of some black metal, and a wide necklace like a black collar . . . .” Her eyes darted to Egeanin, but no faster than Elayne’s.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Unperturbed, the dark-haired woman knelt up to sit on her heels. “I have never heard of an <span class="calibre18">a’dam</span> made for a man, or any like the one you describe. No one tries to control a man who can channel.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“That is exactly what this is for,” Elayne said slowly. <span class="calibre18">Oh, Light, I suppose I was hoping it didn’t exist.</span> At least Nynaeve had found it first; at least they had a chance to stop it being used against Rand.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nynaeve’s eyes narrowed as she took in Egeanin’s free hands, but she did not mention them. “Moghedien must be the only one who knows. It makes no sense, otherwise. If we can find a way into the palace, we can take the seal and the . . . whatever it is. And if we can bring Amathera out as well, Liandrin and her cronies will find the Panarch’s Legion and the Civil
Watch, and maybe the Whitecloaks, closing in. They’ll not all be able to channel their way out of that! The problem is getting inside undetected.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I have had a few thoughts on that,” Elayne told her, “but I fear the men are going to give us difficulties over it.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You leave them to me,” Nynaeve snorted. “I—” A thumping clatter rose in the hall, a man shouted; as quickly as it began, silence fell once more. Thom was on watch out there.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne darted to pull open the door, embracing <span class="calibre18">saidar</span> as she rushed out, but Nynaeve scrambled off the bed right behind her. Egeanin as well.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Thom was just picking himself up off the floor, a hand to his head. Juilin with his staff and Bayle Domon with his cudgel stood over a man with pale yellow hair lying facedown on the floor, unconscious.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne hurried to Thom, trying gently to help him up. He gave her a grateful smile, but stubbornly pushed her hands away. “I am quite all right, child.” All right? A knot was rising on his temple! “The fellow was walking down the hall, when suddenly he kicked me in the head. After my purse, I suppose.” Just like that. Kicked in the head, and he was all right.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He would have had it, too,” Juilin said, “if I had not come to see if Thom wanted a relief.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Did <span class="calibre18">I</span> not decide,” Domon muttered. Their hostility seemed less focused for a change.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">It took Elayne only a moment to realize why. Nynaeve and Egeanin were in the hall in their shifts. Juilin was eyeing them both in an approving manner that would have caused trouble if Rendra had seen it, though he was at least trying not to be obvious. Domon made no effort at all to hide his frank appraisal of Egeanin, crossing his arms and pursing his lips in disgusting fashion while looking her up and down.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The situation dawned on the other women quickly, but their reactions were quite different. Nynaeve, in her thin white silk, gave the thief-catcher a flat stare and strode stiffly into the room, poking a somewhat flushed face back around the side of the doorframe. Egeanin, whose linen shift was considerably longer and thicker than Nynaeve’s—Egeanin, who had been cool serenity while being made prisoner, who fought like a Warder—Egeanin went wide-eyed and crimson-faced, gasping in horror. Elayne stared, amazed, as the Seanchan woman gave a mortified shriek and <span class="calibre18">leaped</span> back inside.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Doors flung open and down the hall heads popped out; they vanished instantly, to the bang of slamming doors, at the sight of a man stretched out on the floor and others standing over him. Heavy dragging noises suggested people blocking themselves in with beds or wardrobes.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Long moments later, Egeanin finally peeked out opposite Nynaeve, still scarlet to her hair. Elayne really did not understand. The woman was in her shift, true, but it covered her very nearly as well as Elayne’s Taraboner dress did. Still, Juilin and Domon had no right to ogle. She fixed the pair with a stare that should have set them to rights immediately.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Unfortunately, Domon was too busy chuckling and rubbing his upper lip to notice. At least Juilin saw, even if he did sigh heavily the way men did when they considered themselves put upon unfairly. Avoiding her eyes, he bent to heave the pale-haired fellow onto his back. A handsome enough man, slender.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I know this fellow,” Juilin exclaimed. “This is the man who tried to rob me. Or so I thought,” he added more slowly. “I do not believe in coincidence. Not unless the Dragon Reborn is in the city.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne exchanged frowns with Nynaeve. Surely the stranger was not in the employ of Liandrin; the Black Ajah would not use men to sneak about the halls any more . . . . Any more than they would have hired street toughs. Elayne moved her gaze to Egeanin questioningly. Nynaeve’s was more demanding.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He is Seanchan,” Egeanin said after a moment.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“A rescue attempt?” Nynaeve murmured dryly, but the other woman shook her head.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I do not doubt he was looking for me, but not for rescue, I think. If he knows—or even suspects—that I let Bethamin go free, he would be wanting to . . . talk with me.” Elayne suspected it was rather more than talk, confirmed when Egeanin added, “It might be best if you slit his throat. He may try to make trouble for you, too, if he thinks you are my friends, or if he discovers you are Aes Sedai.” The big Illianer smuggler gave her a shocked look, and Juilin’s jaw dropped almost to his chest. Thom, on the other hand, nodded in a disturbingly thoughtful fashion.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We are not here to slit Seanchan throats,” Nynaeve said as though that might change later. “Bayle, Juilin, put him out in the alley behind the inn. By the time he wakes, he’ll be lucky to have his smallclothes. Thom, find Rendra and tell her we want strong tea in the Chamber of Falling Blossoms. And ask if she has any willowbark or acem; I will make you something for your head.” The three men stared at her. “Well, move!” she snapped. “We have plans to make!” She barely gave Elayne time to get back inside before closing the door with a bang and beginning to pull her dress over her head. Egeanin scrambled into hers as though the men were still looking at her.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The better way is to ignore them, Egeanin,” Elayne said. It was odd to be advising someone older than Nynaeve, but however competent the Seanchan woman was in other ways, she clearly knew little about men. “It only encourages them, otherwise. I do not know why,” she admitted, “but it does. You were quite decently covered. Really.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egeanin’s head pushed out at the top of her dress. “Decent? I am not a serving girl. I am no shea dancer!” Her scowl became a perplexed frown. “He is rather good-looking, though. I had not thought of him so before.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Wondering what a shea dancer was, Elayne went to help her with her buttons. “Rendra will have something to say to you if you allow Juilin to flirt with you.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The dark-haired woman gave her a startled look over her shoulder. “The thief-catcher? It was Bayle Domon I meant. A properly set-up man. But a smuggler,” she sighed regretfully. “A lawbreaker.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne supposed there was no accounting for tastes—Nynaeve certainly loved Lan, and he was much too stone-faced and intimidating—but Bayle Domon? The man was half as wide as he was tall, as thick as an Ogier!</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You chatter like Rendra, Elayne,” Nynaeve snapped. She was struggling to do up her dress, both hands behind her. “If you have finished blathering about men, perhaps you won’t mind skipping over the new seamstress you’ve no doubt found? We must make plans. If we wait until we’re with the men, they will try to take it over, and I am in no mood to waste time putting them in their place. Have you finished with her yet? I could use some help myself.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Quickly fastening Egeanin’s last small button, Elayne went coolly to Nynaeve. She did <span class="calibre18">not</span> talk about men and dresses. Not <span class="calibre18">nearly</span> as much as Rendra. Holding her braids out of the way, Nynaeve gave her a frown when she tugged sharply at the other woman’s dress to do up the buttons. The close-spaced triple row up the back was necessary, not simply ornament. Nynaeve <span class="calibre18">would</span> let Rendra talk her into the most fashionably tight bodices. And then say <span class="calibre18">other</span> people spent all their time thinking about clothes. <span class="calibre18">She</span> certainly thought of other things. “I have been thinking how we can move inside the palace unnoticed, Nynaeve. We can be all but invisible.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">As she talked, Nynaeve’s frowns smoothed out. Nynaeve herself had conceived a way to enter the palace. When Egeanin made a few suggestions, Nynaeve’s mouth tightened, but the notions were sensible, and even Nynaeve could not reject them out of hand. By the time they were ready to
go down to the Chamber of Falling Blossoms, they had a plan agreed upon, and no intention of letting the men change a whit of it. Moghedien, the Black Ajah, whoever were running things in the Panarch’s Palace, were going to lose their prizes before they knew what had happened.</span></div>
