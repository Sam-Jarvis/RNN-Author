<p class="ct"><span class="epub-i">The Way of the Predator</span></p>
<p class="tni">Perrin and Gaul did another dismayed round of Egwene’s camp—at least, the little of it that reflected in the wolf dream. Her army had been pushed far to the east, and the tents had not been placed long enough at the river to reflect strongly in the wolf dream.</p>
<p class="tx">The wolves had spotted Graendal here, but Perrin had not been able to catch her at whatever she was doing.</p>
<p class="tx">Three times now, Slayer had tried attacking the Bore, and the wolves had warned Perrin. Each time, Slayer had withdrawn before Perrin arrived. The man was testing them. It was the way of the predator, surveying the herd, searching for the weak.</p>
<p class="tx">At least Perrin’s plan with the wolves had worked. Time progressed slowly in the Bore, and so Slayer—by necessity—was slowed down as he tried to reach Rand. That gave Perrin a chance to reach him in time.</p>
<p class="tx">“We need to warn the others about Graendal,” Perrin said, stopping in the center of camp. “She must be communicating with Darkfriends in our camps.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Perhaps we could go to those at the Bore? You managed to speak to Nynaeve Sedai.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Maybe,” Perrin said. “I don’t know if it would be good to distract Nynaeve again, considering what she is up to.” Perrin turned about, looking at the bedrolls that flickered, then vanished in the wolf dream. He and Gaul had checked at Merrilor for a gateway, but none was there currently. If he wanted to go back to the waking world, he’d need to camp there and wait for hours. It seemed like such a waste.</p>
<p class="tx">If only he could figure out how to <span class="epub-i1">shift</span> back to the real world himself. Lanfear implied that he might be able to learn the trick, but his only clue in how to do so lay in Slayer. Perrin tried remembering the moment when the man had <span class="epub-i1">shifted</span> out. Had Perrin sensed anything? A hint to how Slayer did what he did?</p>
<p class="tx">He shook his head. He’d gone over and over that, and had come to no conclusions. With a sigh, he quested out for the wolves. <span class="epub-i1">Any sign of Heartseeker?</span> he asked hopefully.</p>
<p class="tx">The wolves sent amusement. He had been asking them too frequently.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Have you seen any camps of two-legs, then?</span> Perrin sent.</p>
<p class="tx">This earned a vague response. Wolves paid attention to men only to avoid them; in the wolf dream, that didn’t matter much. Still, where men congregated, nightmares sometimes ran wild, so the wolves had learned to keep their distance.</p>
<p class="tx">He would have liked to know how the other battles were progressing. What of Elayne’s army, Perrin’s men, Lord and Lady Bashere? Perrin led Gaul away; they ran with quick strides, rather than jumping to a place immediately. Perrin wanted to think.</p>
<p class="tx">The longer he remained in the wolf dream in the flesh, the more he felt that he should know how to <span class="epub-i1">shift</span> back. His body seemed to understand that this place was not natural for it. He hadn’t slept here, despite <span class="epub-i1">… </span>how long had it been? He could not say. They were almost at the end of their rations, though he felt as though he and Gaul had been here only a handful of hours. Part of that sensation was caused by frequent approaches to the Bore to check on the dreamspike, but it was generally so easy to lose track of time here.</p>
<p class="tx">There was also an ache of fatigue inside him, growing stronger. He didn’t know if he could sleep in this place. His body wanted rest, but had forgotten how to find it. It reminded him a little of when Moiraine had dispelled their fatigue while fleeing the Two Rivers all that time ago. Two years now.</p>
<p class="tx">A very long two years.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin and Gaul inspected Lan’s camp next. It was even more ephemeral than Egwene’s; using the wolf dream for surveillance here was pointless. Lan moved with lots of cavalry, retreating at speed. He and his men did not remain in one place long enough to reflect in the wolf dream except in the most fleeting of ways.</p>
<p class="tx">There were no signs of Graendal. “<span class="epub-i1">Aan’allein</span> is retreating too,” Gaul guessed, surveying the rocky ground that they thought was Lan’s camp. There were no tents here, just the occasional fleeting appearance of sleeping rings marked by a pole at the center where horsemen would hobble their animals.</p>
<p class="tx">Gaul looked up, scanning the landscape to the west. “If they keep falling back from here, they will eventually reach the Field of Merrilor again. Perhaps that is the goal.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Perhaps,” Perrin said. “I want to visit Elayne’s battlefront and—”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Young Bull,</span> a wolf called to him. He found the “voice” of the sending to be familiar somehow. <span class="epub-i1">She is here.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Here?</span> Perrin sent. <span class="epub-i1">Heartseeker?</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Come.</span></p>
<p class="tx">Perrin grabbed Gaul by the arm and <span class="epub-i1">shifted</span> them far to the north. Graendal was at Shayol Ghul? Was she trying to break in and kill Rand?</p>
<p class="tx">They arrived on a ledge overlooking the valley. He and Gaul went down immediately to their stomachs, peering over the edge, inspecting the valley. An old, grizzled wolf appeared beside Perrin. He knew this wolf, he was certain of it—the scent was familiar, but he could not place a name to him, and the wolf did not send one.</p>
<p class="tx">“Where?” Perrin whispered. “Is she in the cavern?”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">No,</span> the grizzled wolf sent. <span class="epub-i1">There.</span></p>
<p class="tx">The wolf sent an image of tents clustered in the valley just below the entrance to the cavern. She had not been spotted in this valley since that first time Perrin had caught her here.</p>
<p class="tx">Ituralde’s troops had been holding here for long enough that their tents were becoming more and more stable in the wolf dream. Perrin <span class="epub-i1">shifted</span>, carefully, down below. Gaul and the wolf joined him as he prowled forward, relying on the wolf’s Sending to lead him.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">There,</span> the wolf said, nodding toward a large tent at the center. Perrin had seen Graendal here before, at this tent, the tent of Rodel Ituralde.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin froze as the tent’s flap rustled. Graendal stepped out. She looked as she had before, with a face like a slab of rock.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin created a thin, painted wall to hide himself, but he needn’t have bothered. Graendal immediately created a gateway and stepped into the waking world. It was night there, though time passed at such a strange rate this close to the Bore, that might not mean much for the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin could see the same tent darkly on the other side of the gateway, two Domani guards out front. Graendal waved a hand, and both stood up straighter and saluted her.</p>
<p class="tx">The gateway began to close as Graendal slipped into the tent. Perrin hesitated, then <span class="epub-i1">shifted</span> to stand just in front of the gateway. He had a moment to decide. Follow?</p>
<p class="tx">No. He had to keep watch on Slayer. However, being this close, he felt something <span class="epub-i1">… </span>an awareness. Stepping through that gateway would be like <span class="epub-i1">… </span></p>
<p class="tx">Like waking up.</p>
<p class="tx">The gateway snapped shut. Perrin felt a stab of regret, but knew staying in the wolf dream had been right. Rand was all but defenseless against Slayer here; he would need Perrin’s help.</p>
<p class="tx">“We need to send warning,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">I suppose I could take the message for you, Young Bull,</span> sent the unnamed wolf.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin froze, then spun, pointing. “Elyas!”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">I am Long Tooth here, Young Bull.</span> Elyas sent amusement.</p>
<p class="tx">“I thought you said you didn’t come here.”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">I said I avoided it. This place is strange and dangerous. I have enough strangeness</span> and <span class="epub-i1">danger in my life in the other world.</span> The wolf sat down on his haunches. <span class="epub-i1">But someone needed to check on you, foolish pup.</span></p>
<p class="tx">Perrin smiled. Elyas’ thoughts were a strange mix of wolf and human. His way of sending was very wolflike, but the way he thought of himself was too individual, too <span class="epub-i1">human</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">“How goes the fight?” Perrin asked eagerly. Gaul took up position nearby, watching, alert, in case Graendal or Slayer appeared. The field before them, the floor of the valley, was quiet for once. The winds had died down, the dust on the sandy ground stirring in small rifts and ripples. Like water.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">I do not know of the other battlefields,</span> Elyas sent, <span class="epub-i1">and we wolves stay far from the two-legs. We fight, here and there, at the edges of the battle. Mostly, we have attacked the Twisted Ones and Neverborn from the other side of the canyon, where there are no two-legs except those strange Aiel.</span></p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">It is a grueling fight. Shadowkiller must do quick work. We have stood five days, but may not last many more.</span></p>
<p class="tx">Five days here in the north. Much longer had passed in the rest of the world since Rand entered to face the Dark One. Rand himself was so close to the Bore that it was likely only hours—maybe minutes—had passed for him. Perrin could feel how time moved differently when he drew near to where Rand fought.</p>
<p class="tx">“Ituralde,” Perrin said, scratching at his beard. “He’s one of the great captains.”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Yes,</span> Elyas sent, smelling of amusement. <span class="epub-i1">Some call him “Little Wolf.”</span></p>
<p class="tx">“Bashere is with Elayne’s army,” Perrin said. “And Gareth Bryne is with Egwene. Agelmar is with the Borderlanders and Lan.”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">I do not know.</span></p>
<p class="tx">“He is. Four battlefronts. Four great captains. <span class="epub-i1">That’s</span> what she’s doing.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Graendal?” Gaul asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes,” Perrin said, anger gathering. “She’s doing something to them, changing their minds, corrupting them. I overheard her saying <span class="epub-i1">… </span>Yes. That’s it, I’m certain. Instead of fighting our armies with armies of her own, she plans to bring down the great captains. Elyas, do you know how a man can <span class="epub-i1">shift</span> in and out of the wolf dream in the flesh?”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Even if I knew this thing—which I do not—I would not teach it to you,</span> Elyas said with a growl. <span class="epub-i1">Has nobody told you it is a terrible, dangerous thing that you do?</span></p>
<p class="tx">“Too many,” Perrin said. “Light! We need to warn Bashere. I must—”</p>
<p class="tx">“Perrin Aybara!” Gaul said, pointing. “He is here!”</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin spun to see a dark blur streak upward toward the entrance to the Pit of Doom. Wolves whimpered and died. Others howled, beginning the hunt. This time, Slayer did not back away.</p>
<p class="tx">The way of the predator. Two or three quick lunges to determine weakness, then an all-out attack.</p>
<p class="tx">“Wake!” Perrin called to Elyas, running up the incline. “Warn Elayne, Egwene, anyone you can! And if you cannot, stop Ituralde somehow. The great captains are being corrupted. One of the Forsaken controls their minds, and their tactics cannot be trusted!”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">I will do it, Young Bull,</span> Elyas sent, fading.</p>
<p class="tx">“Go to Rand, Gaul!” Perrin roared. “Guard the way to him! Do not let any of those red-veils pass you!”</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin summoned his hammer to his hands, not waiting for a reply, then <span class="epub-i1">shifted</span> to confront Slayer.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Rand clashed with Moridin, sword against sword, standing before the darkness that was the essence of the Dark One. The cold expanse was somehow both infinite and empty.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand held so much of the One Power that he nearly burst. He would need that strength in the fight to come. For now, he resisted Moridin sword against sword. He wielded <span class="epub-i1">Callandor</span> as a physical weapon, fighting as if with a sword made of light itself, parrying Moridin’s attacks.</p>
<p class="tx">Each step Rand took dripped blood to the ground. Nynaeve and Moiraine clung to stalagmites as if something were battering them, a wind that Rand could not sense. Nynaeve closed her eyes. Moiraine stared straight ahead as if determined not to look away, no matter the price.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand turned aside Moridin’s latest attack, the blades throwing sparks. He had always been the better swordsman of the two, during the Age of Legends.</p>
<p class="tx">He had lost his hand, but thanks to Tam, that no longer mattered as it once might have. And he was also wounded. This place <span class="epub-i1">… </span>this place changed things. Rocks on the ground seemed to move, and he often stumbled. The air grew alternately musty and dry, then humid and moldy. Time slipped around them like a stream. Rand felt as if he could see it. Each blow here took moments, yet hours passed outside.</p>
<p class="tx">He scored Moridin across the arm, drawing his blood to spray against the wall.</p>
<p class="tx">“My blood and yours,” Rand said. “I have you to thank for this wound in my side, Elan. You thought you were the Dark One, didn’t you? Has he punished you for that?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes,” Moridin snarled. “He returned me to life.” Moridin came swinging hard in a two-handed blow. Rand stepped backward, catching the blow on <span class="epub-i1">Callandor</span>, but he misjudged the slope of the ground. Either that, or the slope changed on him. Rand stumbled, the blow forcing him down on one knee.</p>
<p class="tx">Blade against blade. Rand’s leg slipped backward, and brushed the darkness behind, which waited like a pool of ink.</p>
<p class="tx">All went black.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">The distant Ogier song was comforting to Elayne as she slumped in her saddle atop the hill just north of Cairhien.</p>
<p class="tx">The women around her weren’t in any better shape than she was. Elayne had gathered all of the Kinswomen who could hold on to <span class="epub-i1">saidar</span>—no matter how weak or tired—and formed two circles with them. She had twelve with her in her own circle, but their collective strength in the Power at the moment was barely more than that of a single Aes Sedai.</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne had stopped channeling in an attempt to let the women recover. Most of them slumped in their saddles or sat on the ground. In front of them extended a ragged battle line. Men fought desperately before the Cairhienin hills, trying to hold against the sea of Trollocs. </p>
<p class="tx">Their victory over the northern Trolloc army had been short-lived, as they now found themselves strung-out, exhausted and in serious danger of being surrounded by the southern one.</p>
<p class="tx">“We almost managed,” Arganda said from beside her, shaking his head. “We almost made it.”</p>
<p class="tx">He wore a plume in his helmet. It had belonged to Gallenne. Elayne hadn’t been there when the Mayener commander had fallen.</p>
<p class="tx">That was the frustrating part. They <span class="epub-i1">were</span> close. Despite Bashere’s betrayal, despite the unexpected arrival of the southern force, they had almost pulled it off. If she’d had more time to position her men, if they’d been able to catch more than a moment’s breather between defeating the northern army and then turning to meet this southern one … </p>
<p class="tx">But that was not the case. Nearby, the proud Ogier fought to protect the dragons, but the Ogier were slowly being overrun. The ancient creatures had begun to collapse, like felled trees, pulled down by Trollocs. One by one, their songs broke off.</p>
<p class="tx">Arganda held a bloodied hand to his side, pale-faced, barely able to speak. She didn’t have the strength to Heal him. “That Warder of yours is a <span class="epub-i1">fiend</span> on the battlefield, Your Majesty. Her arrows fly like light itself. I’d swear…<span class="epub-i1">”</span> Arganda shook his head. He might never hold a sword again, even if Healed.</p>
<p class="tx">He should have been sent with the other wounded … somewhere. There wasn’t really anywhere to take them; the channelers were too exhausted to make gateways.</p>
<p class="tx">Her people were fracturing. The Aiel fought in clumps, the Whitecloaks nearly surrounded, the Wolf Guard in no better shape. The Legion of the Dragon heavy cavalry still rode, but Bashere’s betrayal had shaken them.</p>
<p class="tx">Now and then, a dragon fired. Aludra had rolled them back up to the top of the highest hill, but they were out of ammunition, and the channelers didn’t have strength to make gateways to Baerlon to fetch the new dragons’ eggs. Aludra had fired bits of armor until her powder ran low. Now they had only enough for the occasional shot.</p>
<p class="tx">The Trollocs would push through her lines soon, fragmenting her army like ravenous lions. Elayne watched from one of the hilltops, guarded by ten of her Guardswomen. The rest had gone to fight. Trollocs broke through the Aiel to the east of her position, right near the dragoner hilltop position. The beasts charged up the hill, killing the few Ogier defenders on that side, roaring their victory as the dragoners pulled out sabers and grimly stood to defend.</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne wasn’t ready to let the dragons go yet. She gathered strength through the circle; women groaned around her. She took up barely a dribble of the Power, far less than she’d hoped, and directed Fire at the lead Trollocs.</p>
<p class="tx">Her attack arced in the air toward the Shadowspawn. She felt she was trying to stop a storm by spitting at the wind. That lone ball of fire hit.</p>
<p class="tx">The earth exploded beneath it, ripping the hillside and hurling <span class="epub-i1">dozens</span> of Trollocs back in the air.</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne started, causing Moonshadow to shuffle beneath her. Arganda cursed.</p>
<p class="tx">Someone rode up beside her on a large black horse, emerging as if from smoke. The man was tall and well-built and had darks curls of hair down to his shoulders. Logain looked thinner than she remembered from last time she’d seen him, his cheeks sunken, but his face was still handsome.</p>
<p class="tx">“Logain?” she said, shocked.</p>
<p class="tx">The Asha’man gestured sharply. Explosions sounded all across the battlefield. Elayne turned to see over a hundred men in black coats marching through a large gateway on top of her hill.</p>
<p class="tx">“Pull those Ogier back,” Logain said. His ragged voice was raw. Those eyes of his seemed darker now than they once had been. “We will hold this position.”</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne blinked, then nodded for Arganda to pass the command. <span class="epub-i1">Logain shouldn’t give orders to me,</span> she thought absently. For the moment, she let it pass.</p>
<p class="tx">Logain turned his horse and rode to the side of the hilltop, looking down at her army. Elayne followed, feeling numb. Trollocs fell as Asha’man called up strange attacks, gateways that seemed tied to the ground somehow. They stormed forward, killing the Shadowspawn.</p>
<p class="tx">Logain grunted. “You’re in bad shape.”</p>
<p class="tx">She forced her mind to work. The Asha’man were here. “Did Rand send you?”</p>
<p class="tx">“We sent ourselves,” Logain said. “The Shadow has been planning this trap for a long time, according to notes in Taim’s study. I only just managed to decipher them.” He looked at her. “We came to you first. The Black Tower stands with the Lion of Andor.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We need to get my people out of here,” Elayne said, forcing her mind to think through the cloud of fatigue. Her army needed a queen. “Mother’s milk in a cup! This is going to cost us.” She’d probably lose half her force withdrawing. Better half than all of them. “I’ll start bringing my men back in ranks. Can you make enough gateways to lead us to safety?”</p>
<p class="tx">“That wouldn’t be a problem,” Logain said absently, looking down the slope. His impassive face would have impressed any Warder. “But it will be a slaughter. There’s no room for a good retreat, and your lines will grow weaker and weaker as you pull back. The last ranks will be overwhelmed and consumed.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t see that we have any other choice,” Elayne snapped, exhausted. Light! Here, help had come, and she was snapping. <span class="epub-i1">Stop it.</span> She composed herself, sitting up straighter. “I mean to say that your arrival, while appreciated greatly, cannot turn a battle that is this far gone. A hundred Asha’man cannot stop a hundred thousand Trollocs on their own. If we could arrange our battle lines better, get at least a short rest for my men <span class="epub-i1">… </span>but no. That is impossible. We must retreat—unless you can produce a miracle, Lord Logain.”</p>
<p class="tx">He smiled, perhaps at her use of “lord” for him. “Androl!” he barked.</p>
<p class="tx">A middle-aged Asha’man hurried over, a plump Aes Sedai joining him. <span class="epub-i1">Pevara?</span> Elayne thought, too exhausted to make sense of it. <span class="epub-i1">A Red?</span></p>
<p class="tx">“My Lord?” the man, Androl, asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“I need to slow that army of Trollocs long enough for the army to regroup and refield itself, Androl,” Logain said. “How much will it cost us for a miracle?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Well, my Lord,” Androl said, rubbing his chin. “That depends. How many of those women sitting back there can channel?”</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">It was a thing of legends.</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne had heard of the great works performed by large circles of men and women. Every woman in the White Tower was taught of these feats from the past, stories of different days, better days. Days when one half of the One Power had not been a thing to fear, when two halves of one whole had worked together to create incredible wonders.</p>
<p class="tx">She wasn’t sure the days of legend had truly returned. Certainly, the Aes Sedai during those times hadn’t been so worried, so desperate. But what they did now left Elayne in awe.</p>
<p class="tx">She joined in the circle, making the total fourteen women and twelve men. She barely had any strength to lend, but her trickle added to the increasingly large stream. More importantly, a circle had to have at least one more woman than it had men—and now that she had joined, Logain could come in last of all and add his considerable strength to the flow.</p>
<p class="tx">At the head of this circle was Androl, an odd choice. Now that she was part of the circle, she could feel his relative strength. He was extremely weak, weaker than many women who were turned away from the Tower, refused the shawl because of their lack of innate talent.</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne and the others had relocated to the far side of the battlefield. The rest of the Asha’man held back the attacking Trolloc horde as Androl prepared. Whatever he did, it would need to be swift. Elayne still had trouble believing anything could be done. Even with this much power, even with thirteen men and fourteen women working together.</p>
<p class="tx">“Light,” Androl whispered, standing between her horse and Logain’s. “Is this what it feels like to be one of you people? How do you handle so much of the One Power? How do you keep it from consuming you alive, burning you away?”</p>
<p class="tx">Pevara rested her hand on his shoulder in a gesture that was unmistakably tender. Elayne could barely rub two thoughts together amid her fatigue, but she still found herself shocked. She had not expected affection from a Red for a man who could channel.</p>
<p class="tx">“Move the soldiers back,” Androl said softly.</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne gave the order, worried. The man beside her had never held this kind of power before. It could go to someone’s head; she had seen it happen. Light send that he knew what he was doing.</p>
<p class="tx">The soldiers and others retreated, passing by Elayne’s group. Several tired Ogier nodded to her in passing, their shoulders slumped, their arms scored with cuts. The Trollocs poured forward, but the Asha’man who weren’t in the circle disrupted their attack with weaves of the One Power.</p>
<p class="tx">It wasn’t enough. Though the Asha’man fought well, there were just <span class="epub-i1">so</span> many Trollocs. The Asha’man could not stop this tide. What did Logain think could be done?</p>
<p class="tx">Androl smiled widely, and held his hands out in front of himself as if pressing against a wall. He closed his eyes. “Three thousand years ago the Lord Dragon created Dragonmount to hide his shame. His rage still burns hot. Today <span class="epub-i1">… </span>I bring it to you, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p class="tx">A beam of light split the air, easily a hundred feet tall. Moonshadow shied back and Elayne frowned. Why a column of light? What good would that <span class="epub-i1">… </span>The beam of light began to twist in the air, rotating upon itself. Only then did Elayne recognize it for the start of a gateway. An enormous gateway, large enough to swallow buildings. She could have moved an entire wing of the Caemlyn palace through that thing!</p>
<p class="tx">The air shimmered in front of them, the way a gateway always looked from behind. She couldn’t see where the gateway was leading. Did they have an army waiting on the other side?</p>
<p class="tx">She could see the expressions on the slavering Trolloc faces as they looked into the opening. Absolute horror. They broke away, running, and Elayne felt a sudden heat, almost overpowering.</p>
<p class="tx">Something exploded out of the gateway, as if pushed by an incredible force. A column of lava a hundred feet in diameter, blazing hot. The column broke apart as the lava crashed down, splashing to the battlefield, gushing forward in a river. The Asha’man outside the circle used weaves of Air to keep it from splashing back on the circle and to shepherd it in the right direction.</p>
<p class="tx">The river of fire washed through the foremost Trolloc ranks, consuming them, destroying hundreds in an eyeblink. The lava <span class="epub-i1">was</span> under pressure on the other side; that was the only way she could explain the force with which it sprayed from the enormous gateway, turning Trollocs into cinders, burning a large swath through their army.</p>
<p class="tx">Androl held the gateway for long minutes as the Shadow’s army pulled back. Asha’man to the sides used gusts of wind to blow the Shadowspawn back into the ever-widening river. By the time Androl finished, he had created a barrier of red-hot death between Elayne’s army and the bulk of the Trollocs, whose backs were against the northern walls of Cairhien.</p>
<p class="tx">Androl took a breath, closed the gateway, then pivoted and made two others in quick succession, one pointing southeast, the other southwest.</p>
<p class="tx">A second and third column of lava spurted forth—smaller this time, as Androl was obviously weakened. These went tumbling over the land to the east and west of Cairhien, singeing away dead weeds and casting smoke into the air. Some of the Trolloc army had pulled back, but many others had perished, boxed in, with the walled city on one side and lava on others. It would be some time before the Fades could organize the survivors to resume their attacks on Elayne’s forces.</p>
<p class="tx">Androl let the gateway close. He slumped, but Pevara caught him.</p>
<p class="tx">“One miracle, my Lord,” Androl said, voice soft, as if strained. “Delivered as requested. That should hold them back for a few hours. Long enough?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Long enough,” Elayne said. “We will be able to regroup, bring through supplies for the dragons, and fetch as many Aes Sedai from Mayene as we can get to Heal our men and wash away their fatigue. Then we can sort through who is strong enough to continue and reposition our ranks for a much more effective battle.”</p>
