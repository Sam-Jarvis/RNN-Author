<p class="noindent1"><strong class="calibre2">A Note on Dates in This Glossary.</strong> The Toman Calendar (devised by Toma dur Ahmid) was adopted approximately two centuries after the death of the last male Aes Sedai, recording years After the Breaking of the World (AB). So many records were destroyed in the Trolloc Wars that at their end there was argument about the exact year under the old system. A new calendar, proposed by Tiam of Gazar, celebrated freedom from the Trolloc threat and recorded each year as a Free Year (FY). The Gazaran Calendar gained wide acceptance within twenty years after the Wars’ end. Artur Hawkwing attempted to establish a new calendar based on the founding of his empire (FF, From the Founding), but only historians now refer to it. After the death and destruction of the War of the Hundred Years, a third calendar was devised by Uren din Jubai Soaring Gull, a scholar of the Sea Folk, and promulgated by the Panarch Farede of Tarabon. The Farede Calendar, dating from the arbitrarily decided end of the War of the Hundred Years and recording years of the New Era (NE), is currently in use.</p>
<p class="glossary"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">armsmen:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">Soldiers who owe allegiance or fealty to a particular lord or lady.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Asha’man:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">(1) In the Old Tongue, “Guardian” or “Guardians,” but always a guardian of justice and truth. (2) The name given, both collectively and as a rank, to the men who have come to the Black Tower, near Caemlyn in Andor, in order to learn to channel. Their training concentrates on the ways in which the One Power can be used as a weapon, and in another departure from the usages of the White Tower, once they learn to seize <em class="calibre18">saidin</em>, the male half of the Power, they are required to perform all chores and labors with the Power. When newly enrolled, a man is termed a Soldier; he wears a plain black coat with a high collar, in the Andoran fashion. Being raised to Dedicated brings the right to wear a silver pin, called the Sword, on the collar of his coat. Promotion to Asha’man brings the right to wear a Dragon pin, in gold and red enamel, on the collar opposite the Sword. Although many women, including wives, flee when they learn that their men actually can channel, a fair number of men at the Black Tower are married, and they use a version of the Warder bond to create a link with their wives. This same bond, altered to compel obedience, has recently been used to bond captured Aes Sedai as well.</span></p>
<p class="glossary"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Balwer, Sebban:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">Formerly Pedron Niall’s secretary, in public, and secretly Niall’s spymaster. He aided Morgase’s escape from the Seanchan in Amador for his own reasons, and now is employed as secretary to Perrin t’Bashere Aybara and Faile ni Bashere t’Aybara.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Blood, the:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">Term used by the Seanchan to designate the nobility. One can be raised to the Blood as well as born to it.</span></p>
<p class="glossary"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22"><em class="calibre18">Cha Faile</em>:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">(1) In the Old Tongue, “the Falcon’s Talon.” (2) Name taken by the young Cairhienin and Tairens, attempted followers of <em class="calibre18">ji’e’toh</em>, who have sworn fealty to Faile ni Bashere t’Aybara. In secret, they act as her personal scouts and spies.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Companions, the:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">The elite military formation of Illian, currently commanded by First Captain Demetre Marcolin. The Companions provide a bodyguard for the King of Illian and guard key points around the nation. Additionally, the Companions have traditionally been used in battle to assault the enemy’s strongest positions, to exploit weaknesses, and, if necessary, to cover the retreat of the King. Unlike most other such elite formations, foreigners (excepting Tairens, Altarans and Murandians) are not only welcome, they can rise even to the highest rank, as can commoners, which also is unusual. The uniform of the Companions consists of a green coat, a breastplate worked with the Nine Bees of Illian, and a conical helmet with a faceguard of steel bars. The First Captain wears four rings of golden braid on the cuffs of his coat, and three thin golden plumes on his helmet. The Second Captain wears three rings of golden braid on each cuff, and three golden plumes tipped with green. Lieutenants wear two yellow rings on their cuffs, and two thin green plumes, under-lieutenants one yellow ring and a single green plume. Bannermen are designated by two broken rings of yellow on the cuffs and a single yellow plume, squadmen by a single broken ring of yellow.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Consolidation, the:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">When the armies sent by Artur Hawkwing under his son Luthair landed in Seanchan, they discovered a shifting quilt of nations often at war with one another, where Aes Sedai often reigned. Without any equivalent of the White Tower, Aes Sedai worked for their own individual power, using the Power. Forming small groups, they schemed against one another constantly. In large part it was this constant scheming for personal advantage and the resulting wars among the myriad nations that allowed the armies from east of the Aryth Ocean to begin the conquest of an entire continent, and for their descendants to complete it. This conquest, during which the descendants of the original armies became Seanchan as much as they conquered Seanchan, took more than nine hundred years and is called the Consolidation.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22"><em class="calibre18">Corenne</em>:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">In the Old Tongue, “the Return.” The name given by the Seanchan both to the fleet of thousands of ships and to the hundreds of thousands of soldiers, craftsmen and others carried by those ships, who will come behind the Forerunners to reclaim the lands stolen from Artur Hawkwing’s descendants. <em class="calibre18">See also</em> Forerunners.</span></p>
<p class="glossary"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Daughters of Silence, the:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">During the history of the White Tower (over three thousand years), various women who have been put out have been unwilling to accept their fates and have tried to band together. Such groups—most of them by far, at least—have been dispersed by the White Tower as soon as found and punished severely and publicly to make sure that the lesson is carried to everyone. The last group to be dispersed called themselves the Daughters of Silence (794–798 NE). The Daughters consisted of two Accepted who had been put out of the Tower and twenty-three women they had gathered and trained. All were carried back to Tar Valon and punished, and the twenty-three were enrolled in the novice book. Only one of those managed to reach the shawl. <em class="calibre18">See also</em> Kin, the.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22"><em class="calibre18">da’covale</em>:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">(1) In the Old Tongue, “one who is owned,” or “person who is property.” (2) Among the Seanchan, the term often used, along with property, for slaves. Slavery has a long and unusual history among the Seanchan, with slaves having the ability to rise to positions of great power and open authority, including over those who are free. <em class="calibre18">See also</em> so’jhin.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Deathwatch Guards, the:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">The elite military formation of the Seanchan Empire, including both humans and Ogier. The human members of the Deathwatch Guard are all <em class="calibre18">da’covale</em>, born as property and chosen while young to serve the Empress, whose personal property they are. Fanatically loyal and fiercely proud, they often display the ravens tattooed on their shoulders, the mark of a <em class="calibre18">da’covale</em> of the Empress. The helmets and armor are lacquered in dark green and blood-red, their shields are lacquered black, and their spears and swords carry black tassels. <em class="calibre18">See also</em> da’covale.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Defenders of the Stone, the:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">The elite military formation of Tear. The current Captain of the Stone (commander of the Defenders) is Rodrivar Tihera. Only Tairens are accepted into the Defenders, and officers are usually of noble birth, though often from minor Houses or minor branches of strong Houses. The Defenders are tasked to hold the great fortress called the Stone of Tear, in the city of Tear, to defend the city, and to provide police services in place of any City Watch or the like. Except in times of war, their duties seldom take them far from the city. Then, as with other elite formations, they are the core around which the army is formed. The uniform of the Defenders consists of a black coat with padded sleeves striped black-and-gold with black cuffs, a burnished breastplate, and a rimmed helmet with a faceguard of steel bars. The Captain of the Stone wears three short white plumes on his helmet, and on the cuffs of his coat three intertwined golden braids on a white band. Captains wear two white plumes and a single line of golden braid on white cuffs, lieutenants one white plume and a single line of black braid on white cuffs and under-lieutenants one short black plume and plain white cuffs. Bannermen have gold-colored cuffs on their coats, and squadmen have cuffs striped black-and-gold.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Delving:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">(1) The ability to use the One Power to diagnose physical condition and illness. (2) The ability to find deposits of metal ores with the One Power. That this has long been a lost ability among Aes Sedai may account for the name becoming attached to another ability.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22"><em class="calibre18">der’morat-</em>:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">(1) In the Old Tongue, “master handler.” (2) Among the Seanchan, the suffix applied to indicate a senior and highly skilled handler of one of the exotics, one who trains others, as in <em class="calibre18">der’morat’raken. Der’morat</em> can have a fairly high social status, the highest of all held by <em class="calibre18">der’sul’dam</em>, the trainers of <em class="calibre18">sul’dam</em>, who rank with fairly high military officers. <em class="calibre18">See also morat</em>.</span></p>
<p class="glossary"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Fain, Padan:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">Former Darkfriend, now more and worse than a Darkfriend, and an enemy of the Forsaken as much as he is of Rand al’Thor, whom he hates with a passion. Last seen using the name Jeraal Mordeth, advising Lord Toram Riatin in his rebellion against the Dragon Reborn in Cairhien.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Fists of Heaven, the:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">Lightly armed and lightly armored Seanchan infantry carried into battle on the backs of the flying creatures called <em class="calibre18">to’raken</em>. All are small men, or women, largely because of limits as to how much weight a <em class="calibre18">to’raken</em> can carry for any distance. Considered to be among the toughest soldiers, they are used primarily for raids, surprise assaults on positions at an enemy’s rear, and where speed in getting soldiers into place is of the essence.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Forerunners, the:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22"><em class="calibre18">See</em> Hailene.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Forsaken, the:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">The name given to thirteen powerful Aes Sedai, men and women both, who went over to the Shadow during the Age of Legends and were trapped in the sealing of the Bore into the Dark One’s prison. While it has long been believed that they alone abandoned the Light during the War of the Shadow, in fact others did as well; these thirteen were only the highest ranking among them. The Forsaken (who call themselves the Chosen) are somewhat reduced in number since their awakening in the present day. The known survivors are Demandred, Semirhage, Graendal, Mesaana, Moghedien, and two who were reincarnated in new bodies and given new names, Osan’gar and Aran’gar. Recently, a man calling himself Moridin has appeared, and may be yet another of the dead Forsaken brought back from the grave by the Dark One. The same possibility may exist regarding the woman calling herself Cyndane, but since Aran’gar was a man brought back as a woman, speculation as to the identities of Moridin and Cyndane may prove futile until more is learned.</span></p>
<p class="glossary"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Hailene:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">In the Old Tongue, “Forerunners,” or “Those Who Come Before.” The term applied by the Seanchan to the massive expeditionary force sent across the Aryth Ocean to scout out the lands where Artur Hawkwing once ruled. Now under the command of the High Lady Suroth, its numbers swollen by recruits from conquered lands, the Hailene has gone far beyond its original goals.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Hanlon, Daved:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">A Darkfriend, formerly commander of the White Lions in service to the Forsaken Rahvin while he held Caemlyn using the name Lord Gaebril. From there, Hanlon took the White Lions to Cairhien under orders to further the rebellion against the Dragon Reborn. The White Lions were destroyed by a “bubble of evil,” and Hanlon has been ordered back to Caemlyn for purposes as yet unknown.</span></p>
<p class="glossary"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Ishara:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">The first Queen of Andor (circa FY 994–1020). At the death of Artur Hawkwing, Ishara convinced her husband, one of Hawkwing’s foremost generals, to raise the siege of Tar Valon and accompany her to Caemlyn with as many soldiers as he could break away from the army. Where others tried to seize the whole of Hawkwing’s empire and failed, Ishara took a firm hold on a small part and succeeded. Today, nearly every noble House in Andor contains some of Ishara’s blood, and the right to claim the Lion Throne depends both on direct descent from her and on the number of lines of connection to her that can be established.</span></p>
<p class="glossary"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Kin, the:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">Even during the Trolloc Wars, more than two thousand years ago (circa 1000–1350 AB), the White Tower continued to maintain its standards, putting out women who failed to measure up. One group of these women, fearing to return home in the midst of the wars, fled to Barashta (near the present-day site of Ebou Dar), as far from the fighting as was possible to go at that time. Calling themselves the Kin, and Kinswomen, they kept in hiding and offered a safe haven for others who had been put out. In time, their approaches to women told to leave the Tower led to contacts with runaways, and while the exact reasons may never be known, the Kin began to accept runaways, as well. They made great efforts to keep these girls from learning anything about the Kin until they were sure that Aes Sedai would not swoop down and retake them. After all, everyone knew that runaways were always caught sooner or later, and the Kin knew that unless they held themselves secret, they themselves would be punished severely.</span></p>
<p class="glossarya">Unknown to the Kin, Aes Sedai in the Tower were aware of their existence almost from the very first, but prosecution of the wars left no time for dealing with them. By the end of the wars, the Tower realized that it might not be in their best interests to snuff out the Kin. Prior to that time, a majority of runaways actually had managed to escape, whatever the Tower’s propaganda, but once the Kin began helping them, the Tower knew exactly where any runaway was heading, and they began retaking nine out of ten. Since Kinswomen moved in and out of Barashta (and later Ebou Dar) in an effort to hide their existence and their numbers, never staying more than ten years lest someone notice that they did not age at a normal speed, the Tower believed they were few, and they certainly were keeping themselves low. In order to use the Kin as a trap for runaways, the Tower decided to leave them alone, unlike any other similar group in history, and to keep the very existence of the Kin a secret known only to full Aes Sedai.</p>
<p class="glossarya">The Kin do not have laws, but rather rules based in part on the rules for novices and Accepted in the White Tower, and in part on the necessity of maintaining secrecy. As might be expected given the origins of the Kin, they maintain their rules very firmly on all of their members.</p>
<p class="glossarya">Recent open contacts between Aes Sedai and Kinswomen, while known only to a handful of sisters, have produced a number of shocks, including the facts that there are twice as many Kinswomen as Aes Sedai and that some are more than a hundred years older than any Aes Sedai has lived since before the Trolloc Wars. The effect of these revelations, both on Aes Sedai and on Kinswomen, is as yet a matter for speculation. <em class="calibre18">See also</em> Daughters of Silence, the; Knitting Circle, the.</p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Knitting Circle, the:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">The leaders of the Kin. Since no member of the Kin has ever known how Aes Sedai arrange their own hierarchy—knowledge passed on only when an Accepted has passed her test for the shawl—they put no store in strength in the Power but give great weight to age, with the older woman always standing above the younger. The Knitting Circle (a title chosen, like the Kin, because it is innocuous) thus consists of the thirteen oldest Kinswomen resident in Ebou Dar, with the oldest given the title of Eldest. By the rules, all will have to step down when it is time for them to move on, but so long as they are resident in Ebou Dar, they have supreme authority over the Kin, to a degree that any Amyrlin Seat would envy. <em class="calibre18">See also</em> Kin, the.</span></p>
<p class="glossary"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Lance-Captain:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">In most lands, noblewomen do not personally lead their armsmen into battle under normal circumstances. Instead, they hire a professional soldier, almost always a commoner, who is responsible both for training and leading their armsmen. Depending on the land, this man can be called a Lance-Captain, Sword-Captain, Master of the Horse, or Master of the Lances. Rumors of closer relationships than Lady and servant often spring up, perhaps inevitably. Sometimes they are true.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Legion of the Dragon, the:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">A large military formation, all infantry, giving allegiance to the Dragon Reborn, trained by Davram Bashere along lines worked out by himself and Mat Cauthon, lines which depart sharply from the usual employment of foot. While many men simply walk in to volunteer, large numbers of the Legion are scooped up by recruiting parties from the Black Tower, who first gather all of the men in an area who were willing to follow the Dragon Reborn, and only after taking them through gateways to near Caemlyn winnow out those who can be taught to channel. The remainder, by far the greater number, are sent to Bashere’s training camps.</span></p>
<p class="glossary"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22"><em class="calibre18">marath’damane</em>:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">In the Old Tongue, “those who must be leashed,” and also “one who must be leashed.” The term applied by the Seanchan to any woman capable of channeling who has not been collared as a <em class="calibre18">damane</em>.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Master of the Lances:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22"><em class="calibre18">See</em> Lance-Captain.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Master of the Horse:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22"><em class="calibre18">See</em> Lance-Captain.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22"><em class="calibre18">Mera’din</em>:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">In the Old Tongue, “the Brotherless.” The name adopted, as a society, by those Aiel who abandoned clan and sept and went to the Shaido because they could not accept Rand al’Thor, a wetlander, as the <em class="calibre18">Car’a’carn</em>, or because they refused to accept his revelations concerning the history and origins of the Aiel. Deserting clan and sept for any reason is anathema among the Aiel, therefore their own warrior societies among the Shaido were unwilling to take them in, and they formed this society, the Brotherless.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22"><em class="calibre18">morat-</em>:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">In the Old Tongue, “handler.” Among the Seanchan, it is used for those who handle exotics, such as <em class="calibre18">morat’raken</em>, a <em class="calibre18">raken</em> handler or rider, also informally called a flier. <em class="calibre18">See also</em> der’morat.</span></p>
<p class="glossary"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Prophet, the:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">More formally, the Prophet of the Lord Dragon. Once known as Masema Dagar, a Shienaran soldier, he underwent a revelation and decided that he had been called to spread the word of the Dragon’s Rebirth. He believes that nothing—nothing!—is more important than acknowledging the Dragon Reborn as the Light made flesh and being ready when the Dragon Reborn calls, and he and his followers will use any means to force others to sing the glories of the Dragon Reborn. Forsaking any name but “the Prophet,” he has brought chaos to much of Ghealdan and Amadicia, large parts of which he controls.</span></p>
<p class="glossary"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Return, the:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22"><em class="calibre18">See</em> Corenne.</span></p>
<p class="glossary"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22">Sea Folk hierarchy:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">The Atha’an Miere, the Sea Folk, are ruled by the Mistress of the Ships to the Atha’an Miere. She is assisted by the Windfinder to the Mistress of the Ships, and by the Master of the Blades. Below this come the clan Wavemistresses, each assisted by her Windfinder and her Swordmaster. Below her are the Sailmistresses (ship captains) of her clan, each assisted by her Windfinder and her Cargomaster. The Windfinder to the Mistress of the Ships has authority over all Windfinders to clan Wavemistresses, who in turn have authority over all the Windfinders of her clan. Likewise, the Master of the Blades has authority over all Swordmasters, and they in turn over the Cargomasters of their clans. Rank is not hereditary among the Sea Folk. The Mistress of the Ships is chosen, for life, by the First Twelve of the Atha’an Miere, the twelve most senior clan Wavemistresses. A clan Wavemistress is elected by the twelve seniormost Sailmistresses of her clan, called simply the First Twelve, a term which is also used to designate the senior Sailmistresses present anywhere. She can also be removed by a vote of those same First Twelve. In fact, anyone other than the Mistress of the Ships can be demoted, even all the way down to deckhand, for malfeasance, cowardice or other crimes. Also, the Windfinder to a Wavemistress or Mistress of the Ship who dies will, of necessity, have to serve a lower ranking woman, and her own rank thus decreases. The Windfinder to the Mistress of the Ships has authority over all Windfinders, and the Windfinder to a clan Wavemistress authority over all Windfinders of her clan. Likewise, the Master of the Blades has authority over all Swordmasters and Cargomasters, and a Swordmaster over the Cargomaster of his clan.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22"><em class="calibre18">sei’mosiev</em>:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">In the Old Tongue, “lowered eyes,” or “downcast eyes.” Among the Seanchan, to say that one has “become <em class="calibre18">sei’mosiev</em>” means that one has “lost face.” <em class="calibre18">See also</em> sei’taer.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22"><em class="calibre18">sei’taer</em>:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">In the Old Tongue, “straight eyes,” or “level eyes.” Among the Seanchan, it refers to honor or face, to the ability to meet someone’s eyes. It is possible to “be” or “have” <em class="calibre18">sei’taer</em>, meaning that one has honor and face, and also to “gain” or “lose” <em class="calibre18">sei’taer. See also sei’mosiev</em>.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22"><em class="calibre18">Shen an Calhar</em>:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">In the Old Tongue, “the Band of the Red Hand.” (1) A legendary group of heroes who had many exploits, finally dying in the defense of Manetheren when that land was destroyed during the Trolloc Wars. (2) A military formation put together almost by accident by Mat Cauthon and organized along the lines of military forces during what is considered the height of the military arts, the days of Artur Hawkwing and the centuries immediately preceding.</span></p>
<p class="glossary1"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="calibre22"><em class="calibre18">so’jhin</em>:</span></strong> <span class="calibre22">The closest translation from the Old Tongue would be “a height among lowness,” though some translate it as meaning “both sky and valley” among several other possibilities. <em class="calibre18">So’jhin</em> is the term applied by the Seanchan to hereditary upper servants. They are <em class="calibre18">da’covale</em>, property, yet occupy positions of considerable authority and often power. Even the Blood step carefully around <em class="calibre18">so’jhin</em> of the Imperial family, and speak to <em class="calibre18">so’jhin</em> of the Empress herself as to equals. <em class="calibre18">See also</em> Blood, the; <em class="calibre18">da’covale</em>.</span></p>

A Wise Woman is traditionally marked by a red belt. While some have noted that many, indeed most, Ebou Dari Wise Women were not even from Altara, much less Ebou Dar, what was not known until recently, and still is known only to a few, is that all Wise Women are in fact Kinswomen and use various versions of Healing, giving out herbs and poultices only as a cover. With the flight of the Kin from Ebou Dar after the Seanchan took the city, no Wise Women remain there. <em class="calibre18">See also</em> Kin, the.</span></p>
