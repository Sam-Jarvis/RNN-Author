<div class="subtitle-chapter"><span class="calibre2"><span class="calibre18">A Breaking in the Three-fold Land</span></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">T</span>he molten afternoon sun broiled the Waste, flinging shadows across the mountains to the north, just ahead now. The dry hills passed beneath Jeade’en’s hooves, high and low like swells in an ocean of cracked clay, miles rolling away behind. The mountains had held Rand’s eyes since they first came in sight the day before, not snowcapped, not so tall as the Mountains of Mist, much less the Spine of the World, but jagged slabs of brown and gray stone, streaked in some places with yellow or red or bands of glittering flecks, tumbled about so that a man might think to try the Dragonwall afoot first. Sighing, he settled in his saddle and adjusted the <span class="calibre18">shoufa</span> he wore with his red coat. In those mountains lay Alcair Dal. Soon there would be an ending of sorts, or a beginning. Maybe both. Soon, perhaps.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Yellow-haired Adelin strode easily ahead of the dapple stallion, and nine more sun-dark <span class="calibre18">Far Dareis Mai</span> made a wide ring around him, all with bucklers and spears in hand, cased bows on their backs, black veils dangling on their chests ready to be lifted. Rand’s honor guard. The Aiel did not call it that, yet the Maidens came to Alcair Dal for Rand’s honor. So many differences, and he did not know what half really were even when he saw them.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">For instance, Aviendha’s behavior toward the Maidens, and theirs to her. Most of the time, as now, she walked beside his horse with her arms
folded in the shawl around her shoulders; green eyes intent beneath her dark head scarf on the mountains ahead, she seldom spoke with the Maidens beyond a word or two, but that was not the oddity. Her arms folded; that was the heart of it. The Maidens knew she wore the ivory bracelet, yet seemed to pretend not to see it; she would not take it off, yet hid her wrist whenever she thought one of them might be looking.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">You have no society</span>, Adelin had told him when he suggested some other than the Maidens of the Spear might provide his escort. Each chief, whether of clan or sept, would be accompanied by men from the society he had belonged to before becoming chief. <span class="calibre18">You have no society, but your mother was a Maiden.</span> The yellow-haired woman and the other nine had not looked at Aviendha, a few steps away in the entry hall to Lian’s roof; they had <span class="calibre18">not</span> looked intently. <span class="calibre18">For countless years Maidens who would not give up the spear have given their babes for the Wise Ones to hand to other women, none knowing where the child went or even whether boy or girl. Now a Maiden’s son has come back to us, and we know him. We will go to Alcair Dal for your honor, son of Shaiel, a Maiden of the Chumai Taardad.</span> Her face was so set—all of their faces were, including Aviendha’s—that he thought they might offer to dance the spears if he refused.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">When he accepted, they made him go through that ritual of “Remember honor” again, this time with some drink called <span class="calibre18">oosquai</span>, made from <span class="calibre18">ze-mai</span>, drinking to the bottom of a small silver cup with each of them. Ten Maidens; ten little cups. The stuff looked like faintly brown-tinged water, tasted almost like it—and was stronger than double-distilled brandy. He had not been able to walk straight after, and they had got him to bed, laughing at him, no matter how he protested, as much as he could with all of them tickling him so he could barely breathe for laughing himself. All but Aviendha. Not that she went away; she stayed and watched the whole thing with a face as blank as stone. When Adelin and the others finally tucked him into his blankets and left, Aviendha sat down beside the door, spreading her dark, heavy skirts, watching him stonily until he fell asleep. At his waking, she was still there, still watching. And refusing to talk about Maidens or <span class="calibre18">oosquai</span> or any of it; as far as she was concerned, it seemed not to have happened. Whether the Maidens would have been as reticent, he did not know; how could you possibly look ten women in the face and ask why they had gotten you drunk and made a game of taking your clothes off and putting you to bed?</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">So many differences, so few that made much sense that he could see, and no telling which might trip him up and ruin all his plans. Yet he could
not afford to wait. He glanced over his shoulder. What was done, was done. <span class="calibre18">And who can say what’s yet to come?</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Well behind, the Taardad followed him. Not just the Nine Valley Taardad and the Jindo, but the Miadi and the Four Stones, the Chumai and the Bloody Water and more, broad columns surrounding the peddlers’ lurching wagons and the Wise Ones’ party, reaching back two miles through the shimmering heat haze, ringed by scouts and outrunners. Every day more had come in response to the runners Rhuarc had sent that first day, a hundred men and Maidens here, three hundred there, five hundred, according to the size of each sept and what each hold needed to keep for safety.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">In the distance to the south and west, another band was approaching at a run, trailing dust for their pace; perhaps they belonged to some other clan on its way to Alcair Dal, but he thought not. Only two-thirds of the septs represented yet, but he estimated there were well over fifteen thousand Taardad Aiel strung out behind him. An army on the march, and still growing. Nearly an entire clan coming to a meeting of chiefs, in violation of all custom.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Suddenly Jeade’en topped a rise, and there in a long, wide hollow below was the fair gathered for the meeting, and on the hills beyond, the camps of the clan and sept chiefs who had already arrived.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Spread among two or three hundred of the low, wall-less tents, all widely spaced, were pavilions of the same grayish brown material that were tall enough to stand beneath, with goods displayed on blankets in the shade, brightly glazed pottery and even brighter rugs, jewelry in silver or gold. Aiel crafts mainly, but there would be things from beyond the Waste as well, including perhaps silk and ivory from far to the east. No one seemed to be trading; the few men and women in sight sat in one or another of the pavilions, usually alone.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Of the five camps scattered on heights around the fair, four looked just as empty, only a few dozen men or Maidens stirring amid tents set up for as many as a thousand. The fifth camp sprawled over twice as much ground as any of the others, with hundreds of people visible, and likely as many more inside the tents.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rhuarc trotted up the hill behind Rand with his ten <span class="calibre18">Aethan Dor</span>, Red Shields, followed by Heirn with ten <span class="calibre18">Tain Shari</span>, True Bloods, and forty-odd more sept chiefs with their escorts for honor, all with spears and bucklers, bows and quivers. It made a formidable force, more than had taken the Stone of Tear. Some of the Aiel in the camps and among the pavilions were
peering at the hilltop. Not at the Aiel gathered there, Rand suspected. At him; a man on a horse. A thing seen very seldom in the Three-fold Land. He would show them more before he was done.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rhuarc’s gaze settled on the largest camp, where more Aiel in <span class="calibre18">cadin’sor</span> were boiling out of the tents, all to stare in their direction. “Shaido, unless I mistake myself,” he said quietly. “Couladin. You are not the only one to break custom, Rand al’Thor.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Perhaps as well I did.” Rand dragged the <span class="calibre18">shoufa</span> from around his head and stuffed it into his coat pocket atop the <span class="calibre18">angreal</span>, the carving of a round-faced man with a sword across his knees. The sun began baking his bare head to show him how much protection the cloth had been. “If we had come according to custom . . . .” The Shaido were loping toward the mountains, leaving behind apparently empty tents. And causing some little stir in the other camps, and the fair; the Aiel gave over staring at a man on a horse to peer after the Shaido. “Could you have forced a way into Alcair Dal against two-to-one odds or better, Rhuarc?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Not before nightfall,” the clan chief replied slowly, “not even against Shaido dogrobbers. This is more than violation of custom! Even Shaido should have more honor than this!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Angry mutters of agreement rose from the other Taardad on the hilltop. Except the Maidens; for some reason they had gathered around Aviendha off to one side, talking seriously among themselves. Rhuarc spoke a few quiet words to one of his Red Shields, a green-eyed fellow who looked as if his face had been used to pound fence posts, and the man turned downhill, running swiftly back toward the approaching Taardad.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Did you expect this?” Rhuarc asked Rand as soon as the Red Shield left. “Is that why you summoned the entire clan?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Not this exactly, Rhuarc.” The Shaido began forming lines before a narrow gap into the mountains; they were veiling themselves. “But there was no other reason for Couladin to leave in the night except that he was eager to be somewhere, and where would he better like to be than here, causing me trouble? Are the others already in Alcair Dal? Why?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The opportunity presented by chiefs meeting is not to be missed, Rand al’Thor. There will be discussions of boundary disputes, grazing rights, a dozen things. Water. If two Aiel from different clans meet, they discuss water. Three from three clans, and they discuss water and grazing.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“And four?” Rand asked. Five clans represented already, and the Taardad made six.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rhuarc hesitated a moment, hefting one of his short spears unconsciously. “Four will dance the spears. But it should not be so here.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Taardad parted to let the Wise Ones through, shawls over their heads, with Moiraine and Lan and Egwene riding behind. Egwene and the Aes Sedai wore those white cloths around their temples, in damp imitation of the Aielwomen’s head scarves. Mat rode up, too, off by himself, black-hafted spear across his pommel. His wide-brimmed hat shadowed his, face as he studied what lay ahead.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Warder nodded to himself when he saw the Shaido. “That could be messy,” he said softly. His black stallion rolled an eye at Rand’s dapple; only that, and Lan was intent on the Aiel ranks before the gap, yet he patted Mandarb’s neck soothingly. “But not now, I think.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Not now,” Rhuarc agreed.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“If only you would . . . <span class="calibre18">allow</span> me to go in with you.” Except for that one slight hitch, Moiraine’s voice was as serene as ever; cool calm painted her ageless features, but her dark eyes looked at Rand as if her gaze alone could force him to relent.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Amys’s long pale hair, hanging below her shawl, swung as she shook her head firmly. “It is not his decision, Aes Sedai. This is the business of chiefs, men’s business. If we let you go into Alcair Dal now, the next time Wise Ones meet, or roofmistresses, some clan chief will want to put his nose in. They think we meddle in their affairs, and often try to meddle in ours.” She gave Rhuarc a quick smile meant to convey that she did not include him; her husband’s lack of expression told Rand he thought otherwise.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Melaine gripped her shawl under her chin, precisely staring at Rand. If she did not agree with Moraine, at least she mistrusted what he would do. He had hardly slept since leaving Cold Rocks; if they had peered into his dreams, they had seen only nightmares.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Be careful, Rand al’Thor,” Bair said as if she had read his thoughts. “A tired man makes mistakes. You cannot afford mistakes today.” She pulled her shawl down around her thin shoulders, and her thin voice took on an almost angry note. “<span class="calibre18">We</span> cannot afford for you to make mistakes. The Aiel cannot afford it.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The coming of more riders to the hilltop had drawn eyes back to them. Among the pavilions several hundred Aiel, men in <span class="calibre18">cadin’sor</span> and long-haired women in skirts and blouses and shawls, made a watchful crowd. Its attention shifted when Kadere’s dusty white wagon appeared behind its
team of mules off to the right, with the heavy, cream-coated peddler on the driver’s seat, and Isendre all in white silk holding a matching parasol. Keille’s wagon followed, with Natael handling the reins at her side, and the canvas-topped wagons, and finally the three big waterwagons like huge barrels on wheels with their long mule teams. They looked at Rand as the wagons rumbled past in a squeal of ungreased axles, Kadere and Isendre, Natael in his gleeman’s patch-covered cloak, Keille’s great bulk encased in snowy white, a white lace shawl on her ivory combs. Rand patted Jeade’en’s arched neck. Men and women began spilling out of the fair below to meet the approaching wagons. The Shaido were waiting. Soon, now.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene moved her gray close to Jeade’en; the dapple stallion tried to nuzzle Mist and got nipped for his trouble. “You’ve not given me any chance to speak to you since Cold Rocks, Rand.” He said nothing; she was Aes Sedai now, and not just because she called herself one. He wondered if she had spied on his dreams, too. Her face looked tight, her dark eyes tired. “Do not keep to yourself, Rand. You do not fight alone. Others do battle for you, too.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Frowning, he tried not to look at her. His first thought was of Emond’s Field and Perrin, but he did not see how she could know where Perrin had gone. “What do you mean?” he said finally.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I fight for you,” Moiraine said before Egwene could open her mouth, “as does Egwene.” A look flashed between the two women. “People fight for you who do not know it, any more than you know them. You do not realize what it means that you force the form of the Age Lace, do you? The ripples of your actions, the ripples of your very existence, spread across the Pattern to change the weave of life-threads of which you will never be aware. The battle is far from yours alone. Yet you stand in the heart of this web in the Pattern. Should you fail, and fall, all fails and falls. Since I cannot go with you into Alcair Dal, let Lan accompany you. One more pair of eyes to watch your back.” The Warder turned slightly in his saddle, frowning at her; with the Shaido veiled for killing, he would not be eager to leave her alone.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand did not think he was supposed to have seen that look pass from Moiraine to Egwene. So they had a secret to keep from him. Egwene <span class="calibre18">did</span> have Aes Sedai eyes, dark and unreadable. Aviendha and the Maidens had come back to him. “Let Lan stay with you, Moiraine. <span class="calibre18">Far Dareis Mai</span> carries my honor.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine’s mouth tightened at the corners, but apparently that was
exactly the right thing to say so far as the Maidens were concerned. Adelin and the others donned wide grins.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Below, Aiel were crowding around wagon drivers as they began unhitching the mules. Not everyone was paying attention to the Aiel. Keille and Isendre stared at one another from beside their wagons, Natael speaking urgently to one woman, Kadere to the other, until they finally stopped their duel of eyes. The two women had been like that for some time. Had they been men, Rand would have expected it to come to blows long since.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Be on your guard, Egwene,” Rand said. “All of you, be on your guard.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Even the Shaido will not bother Aes Sedai,” Amys told him, “any more than they will bother Bair or Melaine or myself. Some things are beyond even Shaido.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Just be on your guard!” He had not meant to be that sharp. Even Rhuarc stared at him. They did not understand, and he dared not tell them. Not yet. Who would spring their trap first? He had to risk them as well as himself.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What about me, Rand?” Mat said suddenly, rolling a gold coin across the fingers of one hand as though unaware of it. “You have any objections to my going with you?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Do you want to? I thought you’d stay with the peddlers.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Mat frowned at the wagons below, looked to the Shaido lined before the mountain gap. “I don’t think it will be so easy to get out of here if you get yourself killed. Burn me if you don’t stick me in the rendering kettle one way or . . . . <span class="calibre18">Dovienya</span>,” he muttered—Rand had heard him say that before; Lan said it meant “luck” in the Old Tongue—and flipped the gold coin into the air. When he tried to snatch it back, it bounced off his fingertips and fell to the ground. Somehow, improbably, the coin landed on edge, rolling downhill, bounding across cracks in the baked clay, glittering in the sunlight, all the way down to the wagons, where it finally fell over. “Burn me, Rand,” he growled, “I wish you wouldn’t do that!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Isendre picked up the coin and stood fingering it, peering up at the hilltop. The others stared, too; Kadere, and Keille, and Natael.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You can come,” Rand said. “Rhuarc, isn’t it about time?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The clan chief glanced over his shoulder. “Yes. Just about . . .” Behind him, pipes began playing a slow dancing tune. “ . . . now.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Singing rose to the pipes. Aiel boys stopped singing when they reached manhood, except for certain occasions. Only in battle songs and laments for the dead did an Aielman sing once he had taken up the spear. There
were surely Maidens’ voices in that chanted harmony of parts, but deep male voices swallowed them.</span></div>
<br class="calibre8"/><div class="blocktext"><div class="p-br-blocktext"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">“Wash the spears—while the sun climbs high.</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">Wash the spears—while the sun falls low.”</span></span></div></div><br class="calibre8"/>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Half a mile to right and left Taardad appeared, running in time to their song in two wide columns, spears ready, faces veiled, seemingly endless columns rolling toward the mountains.</span></div>
<br class="calibre8"/><div class="blocktext"><div class="p-br-blocktext"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">“Wash the spears—Who fears to die?</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">Wash the spears—No one I know!”</span></span></div></div><br class="calibre8"/>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">In the clan camps and in the fair, Aiel stared in amazement; something in the way they held themselves told Rand they were silent. Some of the wagon drivers stood as if stunned; others let their mules run loose and dove under their wagons. And Keille and Isendre, Kadere and Natael, watched Rand.</span></div>
<br class="calibre8"/><div class="blocktext"><div class="p-br-blocktext"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">“Wash the spears—while life holds true.</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">Wash the spears—until life ends.</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">Wash the spears . . . .”</span></span></div></div><br class="calibre8"/>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Shall we go?” He did not wait for Rhuarc’s nod to heel Jeade’en to a walk down the hill, Adelin and the other Maidens falling in around him. Mat hesitated a moment before booting Pips to follow, but Rhuarc and the Taardad sept chiefs, each with his ten, stepped off with the dapple. Once, halfway to the fair tents, Rand looked back to the hilltop. Moiraine and Egwene sitting their horses with Lan. Aviendha standing with the three Wise Ones. All watching him. He had almost forgotten what it was like not to have people watching him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">As he rode abreast of the fair, a delegation came out, ten or a dozen women in skirts and blouses and much gold and silver and ivory, as many men in the grays and browns of the <span class="calibre18">cadin’sor</span> but unarmed save for a belt knife, and that usually smaller than the heavy-bladed weapon Rhuarc wore. Still, they took a position that forced Rand and the others to halt, and appeared to ignore the veiled Taardad streaming by to east and west.</span></div>
<br class="calibre8"/><div class="blocktext"><div class="p-br-blocktext"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">“Wash the spears—Life is a dream.</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">Wash the spears—All dreams must end.”</span></span></div></div><br class="calibre8"/>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I did not expect this of you, Rhuarc,” a heavyset, gray-haired man said. He was not fat—Rand had not seen a fat Aiel—his heaviness was muscle. “Even from the Shaido it was a surprise, but you!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Times change, Mandhuin,” the clan chief replied. “How long have the Shaido been here?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“They arrived just at sunrise. Why they traveled in the night, who can say?” Mandhuin frowned slightly at Rand, tilted his head toward Mat. “Strange times indeed, Rhuarc.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Who is here besides the Shaido?” Rhuarc asked.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We Goshien arrived first. Then the Shaarad.” The heavy man grimaced over his blood enemies’ name, without stopping his study of the two wetlanders. “The Chareen and the Tomanelle came later. And last the Shaido, as I said. Sevanna convinced the chiefs to go in only a short time ago. Bael saw no reason to meet today, nor did some of the others.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">A broad-faced woman in her middle years, with hair yellower than Adelin’s, put fists on her hips in a rattle of ivory and gold bracelets. She wore as many, and as many necklaces, as Amys and her sister-wife combined. “We hear He Who Comes With the Dawn has come out of Rhuidean, Rhuarc.” She was frowning at Rand and Mat. The entire delegation was. “We hear that the <span class="calibre18">Car’a’carn</span> will be announced today. Before all of the clans arrive.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Then someone spoke you a prophecy,” Rand said. He touched the dapple’s flanks with his heels; the delegation moved out of his way.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“<span class="calibre18">Dovienya</span>,” Mat murmured. “<span class="calibre18">Mia dovienya nesodhin soende</span>.” Whatever it meant, it sounded a fervent wish.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Taardad columns had come up on either side of the Shaido and turned to face them across a few hundred paces, still veiled, still singing. They made no move that could be considered threatening, really, only stood there, fifteen or twenty times the Shaido numbers, and sang, voices thundering in chanting harmony.</span></div>
<br class="calibre8"/><div class="blocktext"><div class="p-br-blocktext"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">“Wash the spears—till shade is gone.</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">Wash the spears—till water turns dry.</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">Wash the spears—How long from home?</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">Wash the spears—Until I die!”</span></span></div></div><br class="calibre8"/>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Riding closer to the black-veiled Shaido, Rand saw Rhuarc lift a hand to his own veil. “No, Rhuarc. We are not here to fight them.” He meant
that he hoped it would not come to that, but the Aielman took it differently.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You are right, Rand al’Thor. No honor to the Shaido.” Leaving his veil hanging, Rhuarc raised his voice. “No honor to the Shaido!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand did not turn his head to look, but he had the feeling black veils were being lowered behind him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Oh, blood and ashes!” Mat muttered. “Blood and bloody ashes!”</span></div>
<br class="calibre8"/><div class="blocktext"><div class="p-br-blocktext"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">“Wash the spears—till the sun grows cold.</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">Wash the spears—till water runs free.</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">Wash the spears . . . .”</span></span></div></div><br class="calibre8"/>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The lines of Shaido shifted uneasily. Whatever Couladin or Sevanna had told them, they could count. To dance the spears with Rhuarc and those with him was one thing, even if it went against all custom; to face enough Taardad to sweep them away like an avalanche was something else. Slowly they parted, moving back to let Rand ride through, stepping back to make a wide path.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand heaved a sigh of relief. Adelin and the other Maidens, at least, walked looking straight ahead, as though the Shaido did not exist.</span></div>
<br class="calibre8"/><div class="blocktext"><div class="p-br-blocktext"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">“Wash the spears—while I breathe.</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">Wash the spears—my steel is bright.</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">Wash the spears . . . .”</span></span></div></div><br class="calibre8"/>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The chant faded to a murmur behind them as they passed into the wide, steep-walled gorge, deep and shadowed as it wound into the mountains. For minutes the loudest sounds were the clatter of hooves on stone, the whisper of soft Aiel boots. Abruptly the passage gave way to Alcair Dal.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand could see why the canyon had been called a bowl, though there was nothing golden about it. Almost perfectly round, its gray wall sloped all the way around except at the far end, where it curled inward like a breaking wave. Clusters of Aiel dotted the slopes, heads and faces bare, many more clusters than there were clans. The Taardad who had come with the sept chiefs peeled away toward one or another of those. According to Rhuarc, grouping by society rather than clan was an aid to keeping peace. Only his Red Shields and the Maidens continued on with Rand and the Taardad chiefs.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The sept chiefs of the other clans all sat by clan, cross-legged before a deep ledge beneath the curling overhang. Six small knots, one of Maidens, stood between the sept chiefs and the ledge. Supposedly these were the Aiel who had come for the honor of clan chiefs. Six, although only five clans were represented. Sevanna would have the Maidens—though Aviendha had been quick to point out that Sevanna had never been <span class="calibre18">Far Dareis Mai</span>—but the extra . . . . Eleven men in that, not ten. Even seeing only the back of a flame-haired head, Rand was sure it was Couladin.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">On the ledge itself stood a golden-haired woman in as much jewelry as the woman back at the fair tents, gray shawl draped over her arms—Sevanna, of course—and four clan chiefs, none armed save for his long belt knife, and one the tallest man Rand had ever seen. Bael of the Goshien Aiel, by the descriptions Rhuarc had given; the fellow had to be at least a hand taller than Rhuarc or himself. Sevanna was speaking, and some trick of the canyon’s shape carried her words clearly throughout.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“ . . . allow him to speak!” Her voice was tight and angry. Head high and back straight she tried to dominate the ledge by force of will. “I demand it as my right! Until a new chief is chosen, I stand for Suladric and the Shaido. I demand my right!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You stand for Suladric until a new chief is chosen, roofmistress.” The white-haired man who spoke in irascible tones was Han, clan chief of the Tomanelle. With a face like dark, wrinkled leather, he would have been taller than average in the Two Rivers; for an Aiel, he was short, if stocky. “I have no doubt you know the rights of a roofmistress well, but perhaps not so well those of a clan chief. Only one who has entered Rhuidean may speak here—and you, who stand in Suladric’s place”—Han did not sound happy about that, but then he sounded as if he was seldom happy—“but the dreamwalkers have told our Wise Ones Couladin was refused the right to enter Rhuidean.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Couladin shouted something, plainly furious yet indistinct—apparently the canyon’s trick only worked from the ledge—but Erim, of the Chareen, his own bright red hair nearly half-white, cut him off sharply. “Have you no respect for custom and law, Shaido? Have you no honor? Stand silent here.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">A few eyes on the slopes turned to see who the newcomers were. A ripple of nudges brought more around at the sight of two outlanders on horseback at the head of the sept chiefs, and one of the riders followed close by Maidens. How many Aiel peered down at him, Rand wondered. Three thousand? Four? More? None made a sound.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We have gathered here to hear a great announcement,” Bael said,
“when all the clans have come.” His dark reddish hair was graying, too; there were no young men among clan chiefs. His great height and deep voice drew eyes to him. “When all the clans have come. If all Sevanna wishes to speak of now is letting Couladin speak, I will go back to my tents and wait.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Jheran, of the Shaarad, blood enemy of Bael’s Goshien, was a slender man, gray streaked heavily through his light brown hair. Slender, as a steel blade is slender, he spoke to no one of the chiefs in particular. “I say we do not return to our tents. Since Sevanna has brought us in, let us discuss what is only somewhat less important than the announcement we await. Water. I wish to discuss the water at Chain Ridge Stand.” Bael turned toward him threateningly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Fools!” Sevanna snapped. “I will have done with waiting! I—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">It was then that those on the ledge became aware of the new arrivals. In utter silence they watched them approach, the clan chiefs frowning, Sevanna scowling. She was a pretty woman, well short of her middle years—and younger-looking for standing among men well the other side of theirs—but with a greedy mouth. The clan chiefs were dignified, even Han in a sour-mouthed fashion; her pale green eyes had a calculating look. Unlike any Aielwoman Rand had ever seen, she wore her loose white blouse undone low enough to show considerable tanned cleavage, framed by her many necklaces. He could have known the men for clan chiefs by their manner; if Sevanna was a roofmistress, she was surely nothing like Lian.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rhuarc strode straight to the ledge, gave his spears and buckler, his bow and quiver, to his Red Shields, and climbed up. Rand handed his reins to Mat—who muttered, “Luck with us!” as he eyed the surrounding Aiel; Adelin nodded encouragingly to Rand—and stepped straight from his saddle to the ledge. A startled murmur rolled around the canyon.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What do you do, Rhuarc,” Han demanded, scowling, “bringing this wetlander here? If you will not kill him, at least send him down from standing like a chief.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“This man, Rand al’Thor, has come to speak to the chiefs of the clans. Did not the dreamwalkers tell you that he would come with me?” Rhuarc’s words brought a louder murmur from the listeners.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Melaine told me many things, Rhuarc,” Bael said slowly, frowning at Rand. “That He Who Comes With the Dawn had come out of Rhuidean. You cannot mean that this man . . . .” He trailed off in disbelief.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“If this wetlander can speak,” Sevanna said quickly, “so may Couladin.” She lifted a smooth hand, and Couladin scrambled onto the ledge, face an angry red.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Han rounded on him. “Stand down, Couladin! It is bad enough that Rhuarc violates custom without you doing it as well!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It is time to be done with worn-out customs!” the fiery-haired Shaido shouted, stripping off his gray-and-brown coat. There was no need for shouting—his words echoed across the canyon—but he did not lower his voice. “I am He Who Comes With the Dawn!” Shoving shirtsleeves above his elbows, he thrust his fists into the air. Around each forearm wound a serpentine creature scaled in crimson and gold, glittering metallically feet each tipped with five golden claws, golden-maned heads resting on the backs of his wrists. Two perfect Dragons. “I am the <span class="calibre18">Car’a’carn</span>!” The roar that came back was like thunder, Aiel leaping to their feet and shouting joyously. The sept chiefs were on their feet, too, the Taardad clustered worriedly, the others shouting as loudly as anyone.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The clan chiefs looked stunned, even Rhuarc. Adelin and her nine Maidens hefted their spears as if they expected to use them any moment. Eyeing the gap leading out, Mat pulled his hat low and guided the two horses close to the ledge, motioning surreptitiously for Rand to get back into his saddle.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Sevanna smiled smugly, adjusting her shawl, as Couladin strode to the front of the ledge with his arms high. “I bring change!” he shouted. “According to the prophecy, I bring new days! We will cross the Dragonwall again, and take back what was ours! The wetlanders are soft, but rich! You remember the wealth brought back when last we went into the wetlands! This time, we will take it all! This time . . . !”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand let the man’s tirade wash over him. Of things possible, he had never suspected this. <span class="calibre18">How?</span> The word kept sliding through his head, yet he could not believe how composed he was. Slowly he took off his coat, hesitating a moment before fishing the <span class="calibre18">angreal</span> from his pocket; sticking it into the waistband of his breeches, he dropped the coat and walked to the front of the ledge, calmly undoing the laces of his sleeves. They slid down as he raised his arms above his head.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">It took a moment for the assembled Aiel to notice the Dragons wrapped around his arms, too, shining in the sunlight. Their hush came by increments, but it was total. Sevanna’s mouth dropped open; she had not known of this. Obviously Couladin had not thought Rand would follow so quickly, had not told her another bore the markings, too. <span class="calibre18">How?</span> The man must have believed he would have time; once he had established himself, Rand could be dismissed as a fraud. <span class="calibre18">Light, how?</span> If the roofmistess of Comarda Hold was
stunned now, so were the clan chiefs, save only Rhuarc. Two men marked as prophecy said only one could be.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Couladin ranted on, waving his arms to make sure all saw. “ . . . will not stop with the lands of the oathbreakers! We will take all the lands to the Aryth Ocean! The wetlanders cannot stand against—” Suddenly he became aware of the silence where eager cries had been. He knew what had caused it. Without turning to look at Rand, he shouted, “Wetlander! Look at his clothes! A wetlander!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“A wetlander,” Rand agreed. He did not raise his voice, but the canyon carried it to everyone. The Shaido looked startled for a moment, then grinned triumphantly—until Rand went on. “What does the Prophecy of Rhuidean say?  ‘Born of the blood.’ My mother was Shaiel, a Maiden of the Chumai Taardad.” <span class="calibre18">Who was she really? Where did she come from?</span> “My father was Janduin, of the Iron Mountain sept, clan chief of the Taardad.” <span class="calibre18">My father is Tam al’Thor. He found me, raised me, loved me. I wish I could have known you, Janduin, but Tam is my father.</span> “ ‘Born of the blood, but raised by those not of the blood.’ Where did the Wise Ones send to look for me? Into the holds of the Three-fold Land? They sent across the Dragonwall, where I was raised. According to the prophecy.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Bael and the other three nodded slowly, but reluctantly; there was still the matter of Couladin also bearing the Dragons, and doubtless they would rather have one of their own. Sevanna’s face had firmed; no matter who bore the real markings, there was no doubt whom she supported.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Couladin’s confidence never wavered; he sneered openly at Rand, the first time he had even looked at him. “How long since the Prophecy of Rhuidean was first spoken?” He still seemed to think he had to shout. “Who can say how much the words have changed? My mother was <span class="calibre18">Far Dareis Mai</span> before she gave up the spear. How much has the rest changed? Or been changed! It is said we once served the Aes Sedai. I say they mean to bind us to them once more! This wetlander was chosen because he resembles us! He is none of our blood! He came with Aes Sedai leading him on a leash! And the Wise Ones greeted them as they would first-sisters! You have all heard of Wise Ones who can do things beyond belief. The dreamwalkers used the One Power to keep me from this wetlander! They used the One Power, as Aes Sedai are said to do! The Aes Sedai have brought this wetlander here to bind us with fakery! And the dreamwalkers help them!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“This is madness!” Rhuarc strode up beside Rand, staring out at the
still silent gathering. “Couladin never went to Rhuidean. I heard the Wise Ones refuse him. Rand al’Thor did go. I saw him leave Chaendaer, and I saw him return, marked as you see.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“And why did they refuse me?” Couladin snarled. “Because the Aes Sedai told them to! Rhuarc does not tell you that one of the Aes Sedai went down from Chaendaer with this wetlander! That is how he returned with the Dragons! By Aes Sedai witchery! My brother Muradin died below Chaendaer, murdered by this wetlander and the Aes Sedai Moiraine, and the Wise Ones, doing Aes Sedai bidding, let them walk free! When night came, I went to Rhuidean. I did not reveal myself until now because this is the proper place for the <span class="calibre18">Car’a’carn</span> to show himself! I <span class="calibre18">am</span> the <span class="calibre18">Car’a’carn</span>!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Lies, touched with just enough flecks of truth. The man was all victorious confidence, sure he had an answer for anything.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You say you went to Rhuidean without the permission of the Wise Ones?” Han demanded, frowning. Towering Bael looked just as disapproving with his arms folded, Erim and Jheran only slightly less so. The clan chiefs, at least, still wavered. Sevanna gripped her belt knife, glaring at Han as if she would like to drive it into his back.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Couladin had his answer, though. “Yes, without it! He Who Comes With the Dawn brings change! So says the prophecy! Useless ways must change, and I will change them! Did I not arrive here with the dawn?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The clan chiefs stood balanced on the edge, and so did all the watching Aiel, all on their feet now, staring silently, waiting in their thousands. If Rand could not convince them, he likely would not leave Alcair Dal alive. Mat motioned again to Jeade’en’s saddle. Rand did not even bother to shake his head. There was a consideration beyond getting out alive; he needed these people, needed their loyalty. He <span class="calibre18">had</span> to have people who followed him because they believed, not to use him, or for what he could give them. He had to.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Rhuidean,” he said. The word seemed to fill the canyon. “You claim you went to Rhuidean, Couladin. What did you see there?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“All know Rhuidean is not to be spoken of,” Couladin shot back.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We can go apart,” Erim said, “and speak in private so you can tell us—” The Shaido cut him off, face flushed angrily.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I will speak of it with no one. Rhuidean is a holy place, and what I saw was holy. <span class="calibre18">I</span> am holy!” He raised his Dragon marked arms again. “These make me holy!”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I walked among glass columns beside <span class="calibre18">Avendesora.</span>” Rand spoke quietly, but the words carried everywhere. “I saw the history of the Aiel through my ancestors’ eyes. What did you see, Couladin? I am not afraid to speak. Are you?” The Shaido quivered with rage, face nearly the color of his fiery hair.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Uncertain looks passed between Bael and Erim, Jheran and Han. “We must go apart for this,” Han muttered.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Couladin did not seem to realize he had lost his advantage with the four, but Sevanna did. “Rhuarc has told him these things,” she spat. “One of Rhuarc’s wives is a dreamwalker, one of those who aids the Aes Sedai! Rhuarc has told him!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Rhuarc would not,” Han snapped at her. “He is clan chief, and a man of honor. Do not speak of what you do not know, Sevanna!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I am not afraid!” Couladin shouted. “No man can call me afraid! I, too, saw with my ancestors’ eyes! I saw our coming to the Three-fold Land! I saw our glory! The glory I will bring back to us!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I saw the Age of Legends,” Rand announced, “and the beginning of the Aiel journey to the Three-fold Land.” Rhuarc caught his arm, but he shook the clan chief off. This moment had been fated since the Aiel gathered before Rhuidean the first time. “I saw the Aiel when they were called the Da’shain Aiel, and followed the Way of the Leaf.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“No!” The shout rose from out in the canyon and spread in a roar. “No! No!” From thousands of throats. Spearpoints shaken in the air caught the sunlight. Even some of the Taardad sept chiefs were shouting. Adelin stared up at Rand, stricken. Mat shouted something at Rand, lost in the thunder, waving urgently for him to take his saddle.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Liar!” The canyon’s shape carried Couladin’s bellow, wrath mixed with triumph, over the shouts of the gathering. Shaking her head frantically, Sevanna reached for him. She must at least have suspected now that he was the fake, yet if she could keep him quiet they might yet pull it off. As Rand hoped, Couladin pushed her away. The man knew Rand had been to Rhuidean—he could not possibly believe half of his own story—but neither could he believe this. “He proves himself a fraud from his own mouth! We have always been warriors! Always! To the beginning of time!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The roar swelled, spears shaking, but Bael and Erim, Jheran and Han stood in stony silence. They knew now. Unaware of their looks, Couladin waved his Dragon-wreathed arms to the assembled Aiel, exulting in the adulation.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Why?” Rhuarc said softly beside Rand. “Did you not understand why we do not speak of Rhuidean? To face that we were once so different from everything we believe, that we were the same as the despised Lost Ones you call Tuatha’an. Rhuidean kills those who cannot face it. Not more than one man in three lives who goes to Rhuidean. And now you have spoken for all to hear. It cannot be stopped here, Rand al’Thor. It will spread. How many will be strong enough to bear it?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">He will take you back, and he will destroy you.</span> “I bring change,” Rand said sadly. “Not peace, but turmoil.” <span class="calibre18">Destruction follows on my heels everywhere. Will there ever be anywhere I do not tear apart?</span> “What will be, will be, Rhuarc. I can’t change it.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What will be, will be,” the Aielman murmured after a moment.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Couladin still strode up and down, shouting to the Aiel of glory and conquest, unaware of the clan chiefs staring at his back. Sevanna did not look at Couladin at all; her pale green eyes were intent on the clan chiefs, lips pulled back in a grimace, breasts heaving with anxious breaths. She had to know what their silent stares meant.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Rand al’Thor,” Bael said loudly, the name slicing through Couladin’s shouts, cutting off the roar of the crowd like a blade. He stopped to clear his throat, head swinging as though seeking a way out of this. Couladin turned, folding his arms confidently, no doubt expecting a sentence of death for the wetlander. The very tall clan chief took a deep breath. “Rand al’Thor is the <span class="calibre18">Car’a’carn.</span> Rand al’Thor is He Who Comes With the Dawn.” Couladin’s eyes widened in incredulous fury.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Rand al’Thor is He Who Comes With the Dawn,” leathery-faced Han announced, just as reluctantly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Rand al’Thor is He Who Comes With the Dawn.” That from Jheran, grimly, and from Erim, “Rand al’Thor is He Who Comes With the Dawn.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Rand al’Thor,” Rhuarc said, “is He Who Comes With the Dawn.” In a voice too soft to carry even from the ledge, he added, “And the Light have mercy on us.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">For a long, stretched moment the silence lasted. Then Couladin leaped snarling from the ledge, snatching a spear from one of his <span class="calibre18">Seia Doon</span>, hurling it straight at Rand. Yet as he moved down, Adelin leaped up; his spearpoint stabbed through the layered bullhide of her outstretched buckler, swinging her around.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Pandemonium exploded through the canyon, men shouting and shoving. The other Jindo Maidens jumped up beside Adelin, forming a screen in front of Rand. Sevanna had climbed down to shout urgently at Couladin,
hanging on his arm as he tried to lead his Shaido Black Eyes against the Maidens between him and Rand. Heirn and a dozen more Taardad sept chiefs joined Adelin, spears ready, but others were shouting loudly. Mat scrambled up, gripping his black-hafted spear with its raven-marked sword point, roaring what had to be curses in the Old Tongue. Rhuarc and the other clan chiefs raised their voices, vainly trying to restore order. The canyon boiled like a cauldron. Rand saw veils lifted. A spear flashed, stabbing. Another. He had to stop this.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He reached out for <span class="calibre18">saidin</span>, and it flooded into him until he thought he would burst if he did not burn first; the filth of the taint spreading through him seemed to curdle his bones. Thought floated outside the Void; cold thought. Water. Here where water was so scarce, the Aiel always talked of water. Even in this dry air there was some water. He channeled, not really knowing what he did, reached out blindly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Sharp lightning crackled above Alcair Dal, and the wind rushed in from every direction, howling across the lip of the canyon to drown the Aiel’s shouts. Wind, bringing minute traces of water, more and more, until something happened no man had ever seen there. A mist of rain began to fall. The wind above shrieked and swirled. Wild lightnings streaked the sky. And the rain grew heavier and heavier, to a driving downpour, sweeping over the ledge, plastering his hair to his head and his shirt to his back, blanking out everything fifty paces away.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Abruptly the rain stopped hitting him; and invisible dome expanded around him, pushing Mat and the Taardad away. Through the water pouring down its side he could dimly see Adelin pounding at it, trying to force her way through to him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You utter fool, playing games with these other fools! Wasting all my planning and effort!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Water dripped down his face as he turned to face Lanfear. Her silver-belted white dress was perfectly dry, the black waves of her hair untouched by a single raindrop among the silver stars and crescents. Those large black eyes stared at him furiously; anger twisted her beautiful face.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I didn’t expect you to reveal yourself yet,” he said quietly. The Power still filled him; he rode the buffeting torrents, holding on with a desperation he kept out of his voice. It was not necessary to pull in more, only to let it come till it seemed his bones would crisp to ash. He did not know if she could shield him while <span class="calibre18">saidin</span> actually roared through him, but he let it fill him against the possibility. “I know you are not alone. Where is he?”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Lanfear’s beautiful mouth tightened. “I knew he would give himself away, coming into your dream. I could have managed matters if his panic—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I knew from the start,” he broke in. “I expected it from the day I left the Stone of Tear. Out here, where anyone could see I was fixed on Rhuidean and the Aiel. Do you think I did not expect some of you to come after me? But the trap is <span class="calibre18">mine</span>, Lanfear, not yours. Where is he?” The last came as a cold shout. Emotion skittered uncontrollably around the Void that surrounded him inside, the emptiness that was not empty, the emptiness filled with the Power.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“If you knew,” she snapped back, “why did you chase him away with your talk of fulfilling your destiny, of doing <span class="calibre18">what has to be done</span>?” Scorn weighted the words like stones. “I brought Asmodean to teach you, but he was always one to leap to another plan if the first proved difficult. Now he thinks he has found something better for himself in Rhuidean. And he is off to take it while you stand here. Couladin, the Draghkar, all to hold your attention while he made sure. All my plans for nothing because you must be stubborn! Do you have any idea what effort it will take to convince him again? It must be him. Demandred or Rahvin or Sammael would kill you before teaching you to lift a hand unless they have you bound like a dog at heel!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rhuidean. Yes. Of course. Rhuidean. How many weeks to the south? Yet he had done something once. If he could remember how . . . . “And you let him go? After all your talk of aiding me?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Not openly, I said. What could he find in Rhuidean worth my coming into the open? When you agree to stand with me will be time enough. Remember what I told you, Lews Therin.” Her voice took on a seductive note; those full lips curved, those dark eyes tried to swallow him like bottomless pools. “Two great <span class="calibre18">sa’angreal.</span> With those, together, we can challenge—” This time she stopped on her own. He had remembered.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">With the Power he <span class="calibre18">folded</span> reality, <span class="calibre18">bent</span> a small patch of what was. A door opened beneath the dome in front of him. That was the only way to describe it. An opening into darkness, into somewhere else.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You do remember a few things, it seems.” She eyed the doorway, shifted that suddenly suspicious gaze to him. “Why are you so anxious? What is in Rhuidean?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Asmodean,” he said grimly. For a moment he hesitated. He could not see beyond the rain-drenched dome. What was happening out there? And Lanfear. If only he could remember how he had shielded Egwene and Elayne. <span class="calibre18">If only I could make myself kill a woman who’s only frowning at me. She
is one of the Forsaken!</span> It was no more possible now than it had been in the Stone.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Stepping through the door, he left her on the ledge and closed it behind him. No doubt she knew how to make one of her own, but the making of it would slow her down.</span></div>
