<div class="subtitle-chapter"><span class="calibre2"><span class="calibre18">Into the Heart</span></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">T</span>airen nobility filled the great vaulted chamber with its huge polished redstone columns, ten feet thick, rising into shadowed heights above golden lamps hanging on golden chains. The High Lords and Ladies were arrayed in a thick hollow circle under the great dome at the chamber’s heart with the lesser nobles ranked behind, row on row back into the forest of columns, all in their best velvets and silks and laces, wide sleeves and ruffed collars and peaked hats, all murmuring uneasily so the towering ceiling echoed the sounds of nervous geese. Only the High Lords themselves had ever before been bidden to this place, called the Heart of the Stone, and they had come only four times a year, at the twin demands of law and custom. They came now, all who were not out in the countryside somewhere, at the summons of their new lord, the maker of law and breaker of custom.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The packed crowd gave way before Moiraine as soon as they saw who she was, so she and Egwene moved in a pocket of open space. Lan’s absence irritated Moiraine. It was not like the man to vanish when she might need him; his way usually was to watch over her as if she could not fend for herself without a guardian. Had she not been able to feel the bond linking them and known he could not be very far from the Stone, she might have worried.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He fought the strings Nynaeve was tying to him as hard as he had ever
fought Trollocs in the Blight, but much as he might deny it, that young woman had bound him as tightly as she herself did, though in other ways. He might as well try tearing steel with his hands as those ties. She was not jealous, exactly, but Lan had been her sword arm, her shield and companion for too many years for her to give him up lightly. <span class="calibre18">I have done what had to be done, there. She will have him if I die, and not before. Where is the man? What is he doing?</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">One red-gowned lace-ruffed woman, a horse-faced Lady of the Land called Leitha, drew her skirts away a bit too assiduously, and Moiraine looked at her. Merely looked, without slowing her step, but the woman shuddered and dropped her eyes. Moiraine nodded to herself. She could accept that these people hated Aes Sedai, but she would not endure open rudeness on top of veiled slights. Besides, the rest shied back another step after seeing Leitha faced down.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Are you certain he said nothing of what he means to announce?” she asked quietly. In this gabble, no one three paces away could have made out a word. The Tairens kept about that distance now. She did not like being overheard.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Nothing,” Egwene said just as softly. She sounded as irritated as Moiraine felt.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“There have been rumors.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Rumors? What sort of rumors?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The girl was not that good at controlling her face and voice; clearly she had not heard the tales, of doings in the Two Rivers. Betting that Rand had not, though, might be putting her horse at a ten-foot fence. “You should bring him to confide in you. He needs an attentive ear. It will help him, to talk out his troubles with someone he can trust.” Egwene gave her a sidelong glance. She was becoming too sophisticated for such simple methods. Still, Moiraine had spoken unadorned truth—the boy did need someone to listen and by listening lighten his burdens—and it might work.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He will not confide in anyone, Moiraine. He hides his pains, and hopes he can deal with them before anyone notices.” Anger flashed across Egwene’s face. “The wool-brained mule!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine felt a momentary sympathy. The girl could not be expected to accept Rand’s strolling about arm in arm with Elayne, kissing in corners where they thought themselves unseen. And Egwene did not know the half, yet. Commiseration did not last. There was too much of importance
to deal with for the girl to be fretting over what she could not have in any case.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne and Nynaeve should be aboard the raker by now, out of the way. Their voyage might eventually tell her if her suspicions about the Windfinders were correct. That was a minor point, though. At worst the pair had enough gold to buy a ship and hire a crew—which might be necessary given the rumors of Tanchico—with enough left for the bribes so often necessary with Taraboner officials. Thom Merrilin’s room was empty, and her informants had reported him muttering about Tanchico on his way out of the Stone; he would see they got a good crew and found the right officials. The purported plan with Mazrim Taim was much the more likely of the two, but her messages to the Amyrlin should have taken care of that. The two young women could handle the much less likely eventuality of a mysterious danger hidden in Tanchico, and they were out of her hair and away from Rand. She only regretted that Egwene had refused to go with them. Tar Valon would have been best for all three, but Tanchico would do.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Speaking of wool-brained, do you mean to continue with this plan to go into the Waste?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I do,” the girl said firmly. She needed to be back in the Tower, training her strength. <span class="calibre18">What was Siuan thinking of? She will probably give me one of those sayings about boats and fish, when I can ask her.</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">At least Egwene would be out of the way, too, and the Aiel girl would look after her. Perhaps the Wise Ones really could teach her something of Dreaming. That had been the most astounding letter from them, not that she could afford to heed most of it. Egwene’s journey into the Waste might be useful in the long run.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The last line of Tairens gave way, making a little hollow, and she and Egwene faced the open area under the vast dome. The nobles’ ill ease was most evident here; many studied their feet like sulky children, and others stared at nothing, looking at anything but where they were. Here was where <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> had been kept before Rand took it. Here beneath this dome, untouched by any hand for more than three thousand years, untouchable by any hand but that of the Dragon Reborn.  Tairens did not like admitting that the Heart of the Stone existed.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Poor woman,” Egwene murmured.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine followed the girl’s gaze. The High Lady Alteima, already
gowned and ruffed and capped in shimmering white as Tairen widows were though her husband still lingered, was perhaps the most composed of all the nobles. She was a slender, lovely woman, made more so by her small sad smile, with large brown eyes and long black hair hanging halfway to her waist. A tall woman, though Moiraine admitted she did tend to judge such things by her own height, and rather too full-bosomed. Cairhienin were not a tall people, and she had been considered short even among them.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Yes, a poor woman,” she said, but she did not mean it for sympathy. It was good to see Egwene had not yet grown sophisticated enough to see beneath the surface all the time. The girl was already far less malleable than she should have been for years yet. She needed to be shaped before she was hardened.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Thom had missed, with Alteima. Or perhaps he had not wanted to see; he seemed to have a strange reluctance to move against women. The High Lady Alteima was far more dangerous than her husband or her lover, both of whom she had manipulated without either knowing it. Perhaps more dangerous than anyone else in Tear, man or woman. She would find others to use soon enough. It was Alteima’s style to remain in the background and pull strings. Something would have to be done about her.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine shifted her gaze along the rows of High Lords and Ladies, until she found Estanda, in brocaded yellow silks with a large ivory lace ruff and a tiny matching cap. A certain sternness marred the beauty of her face, and the occasional glances she gave Alteima were iron hard. Feelings between the two went beyond mere rivalry; had they been men, one would have shed the other’s blood in a duel years since. If that antagonism could be sharpened, Alteima would be too busy to make trouble for Rand.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">For an instant she regretted sending Thom away. She did not like having to waste her time with these petty affairs. But he had too much influence with Rand; the boy had to depend on her counsel. Hers, and hers alone. The Light knew he was difficult enough without interference. Thom had been settling the boy down to rule Tear when he needed to be moving on to greater things. But that was dealt with for now. The problem of bringing Thom Merrilin to heel could be managed later. Rand was the dilemma now. What did he mean to announce?</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Where is he? He has learned the first art of kings, it seems. Making people wait.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She did not realize she had spoken aloud until Egwene gave her a
startled look. She smoothed the irritation from her face immediately. Rand would appear eventually, and she would learn what he meant to do. Learn along with everyone else. She nearly ground her teeth. That blind fool of a boy, running headlong through the night with never a care for cliffs, never thinking he could carry the world over as well as himself. If only she could keep him from rushing back to save his village. He would want to, but he could not afford to do so now. Perhaps he did not know; it could be hoped.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Mat stood across from them, uncombed and slouching with his hands in the pockets of his high-collared green coat. It was half-unbuttoned, as usual, and his boots were scuffed, in sharp contrast to the precise elegance around him. He shifted nervously as he saw her looking at him, then gave one of his rudely defiant grins. At least he was here, under her eye. Mat Cauthon was an exhausting young man to keep track of, avoiding her spies with ease; he never gave any sign that he knew they were there, but her eyes-and-ears reported that he seemed to slide out of sight whenever they got too close.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I think he sleeps in his coats,” Egwene said disapprovingly. “On purpose. I wonder where Perrin is.” She went on tiptoes, trying to search over the heads of the assemblage. “I don’t see him.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Frowning, Moiraine scanned the crowd, not that she could make out much beyond the front row. Lan could have been back among the columns. She would not strain, though, or jump up on her toes like an anxious child. Lan was due a talking-to he would not soon forget when she laid hands on him. With Nynaeve tugging at him one way and <span class="calibre18">ta’veren</span>—Rand, at least—seemingly pulling another, she sometimes wondered how well their bond still held. At least his time with Rand was useful; it gave her another string to the young man.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Perhaps he is with Faile,” Egwene said. “He won’t have run away, Moiraine. Perrin has a strong sense of duty.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Almost as strong as a Warder’s, Moiraine knew, which was why she did not keep eyes-and-ears on him as she tried to with Mat. “Faile has been trying to talk him into leaving, girl.” Quite possibly he was with her; he usually was. “Do not look so surprised. They often talk—and argue—where they can be overheard.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I am not surprised you know,” Egwene said dryly, “only that Faile would try to talk him out of what he knows he has to do.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Perhaps she does not believe it as he does.” Moiraine had not believed it herself, at first, had not seen it. Three <span class="calibre18">ta’veren</span>, all the same age,
coming out of one village; she must have been blind not to realize they had to be connected. Everything had become much more complicated with that knowledge. Like trying to juggle three of Thom’s colored balls one-handed and blindfolded; she had seen Thom do that, but she would not want to try. There was no guide to how they were connected, or what they were supposed to do; the Prophecies never mentioned companions.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I like her,” Egwene said. “She is good for him, just what he needs. And she cares for him deeply.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I suppose she does.” If Faile became too troublesome, Moiraine would have to have a talk with her, about the secrets Faile had been keeping from Perrin. Or have one of her eyes-and-ears do it. That should settle her down.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You say it as if you don’t believe it. They love each other, Moiraine. Can’t you see that? Can’t you even recognize a human emotion when you see one?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine gave her a firm look, one that settled her on her heels in a satisfactory manner. The girl knew so little and thought she knew so much. Moiraine was about to tell her so in withering fashion when startled, even fearful, gasps rose from among the Tairens.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The crowd gave way hurriedly, more than eagerly, those in front ruthlessly forcing those behind farther back, opening a wide passage to the space beneath the dome. Rand strode down that corridor, looking straight ahead, imperious in a red coat embroidered with golden scrolls up his sleeves, cradling <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> in his right arm like a scepter. It was not only he that made the Tairens give way, though. Behind him came perhaps a hundred Aiel, spears and arrow-nocked bows in hand, <span class="calibre18">shoufa</span> wrapped around their heads, black veils hiding everything but their eyes. Moiraine thought she recognized Rhuarc at the front, just behind Rand, but only by the way he moved. They were anonymous. Ready for killing. Plainly, whatever he meant to say, Rand intended to quell any resistance before it had a chance to coalesce.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Aiel halted, but Rand kept on until he stood centered under the dome, then ran his eye around the gathering. He seemed surprised, and perhaps upset, at the sight of Egwene, but he gave Moiraine an infuriating smile, and Mat one that made the pair of them look like boys when Mat returned it. The Tairens were white-faced, not knowing whether to stare at Rand and <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> or the veiled Aiel; either could be death in their midst.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The High Lord Sunamon,” Rand said suddenly, and loudly, making that plump fellow jump, “has guaranteed me a treaty with Mayene, strictly following lines I gave him. He has guaranteed this with his life.” He laughed as if he had made a joke, and most of the nobles laughed with him. Not Sunamon, who looked distinctly ill. “If he fails,” Rand announced, “he has agreed to be hanged, and he will be obliged.” The laughter stopped. Sunamon’s face took on a sickly tinge of green. Egwene gave Moiraine a troubled glance; she was gripping her skirt with both hands. Moiraine only waited; he had not brought every noble within ten miles together to tell them of a treaty or threaten a fat fool. She made her hands let go of her own skirts.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand turned in a circle, weighing the faces he saw. “Because of this treaty, ships will soon be available to carry Tairen grain west, to find new markets.” There were a few appreciative murmurs at that, quickly stifled. “But there is more. The armies of Tear are to march.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">A cheer rose, tumultuous shouts ringing from the ceilings. Men capered, even the High Lords, and shook their fists over their heads, and tossed up peaked velvet hats. Women, smiling as rapturously as the men, bestowed kisses on the cheeks of those who would go to war, and delicately sniffed the tiny porcelain bottles of smelling salts no Tairen noblewoman would be without, pretending to be made faint by the news. “Illian shall fall!” someone cried, and hundreds of voices seized it like thunder. “Illian shall fall! Illian shall fall! Illian shall fall!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine saw Egwene’s lips moving, the words crushed beneath the jubilation. She could read them, though. “No, Rand. Please, no. Please don’t.” On the far side of Rand, Mat was frowning in disapproving silence. They and she were the only ones not celebrating, aside from the ever-watchful Aiel and Rand himself. Rand’s smile was twisted contemptuously, and never touched his eyes. There was fresh sweat on his face. She met his sardonic stare and waited. There would be more, and not, she suspected, to her liking.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand raised his left hand. Slowly quiet fell, those in front anxiously shushing those behind. He waited for absolute silence. “The armies will move north, into Cairhien. The High Lord Meilan will command, and under him, the High Lords Gueyam, Aracome, Hearne, Maraconn and Simaan. The armies will be generously financed by the High Lord Torean, the wealthiest of you, who will accompany the armies to see that his money is spent wisely.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Dead silence greeted this pronouncement. No one moved, though plain-faced Torean seemed to be having trouble standing.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine had to give Rand a mental bow for his choices. Sending those seven out of Tear neatly eviscerated the seven most dangerous plots against him, and none of those men trusted each other enough to scheme among themselves. Thom Merrilin had given him good advice; obviously her spies had missed some of the notes he had had slipped into Rand’s pockets. But the rest? It was madness. He could not have had this for an answer on the other side of that <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal.</span> It was not possible, surely.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Meilan obviously agreed with her, if not for the same reasons. He stepped forward hesitantly, a lean hard man but so frightened that the whites of his eyes showed all the way around. “My Lord Dragon . . . .” He stopped, swallowed, and began again in a marginally stronger voice. “My Lord Dragon, intervening in a civil war is stepping into a bog. A dozen factions contend for the Sun Throne, with as many shifting alliances, each one betrayed every day. Besides that, bandits infest Cairhien as fleas on a wild boar. Starving peasants have stripped the land bare. I am reliably informed that they eat bark and leaves. My Lord Dragon,  ‘a quagmire’ barely begins to describe—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand cut him off. “You do not want to extend Tear’s sway all the way to Kinslayer’s Dagger, Meilan? That is all right. I know who I mean to sit on the Sun Throne. You do not go to conquer, Meilan, but to restore order, and peace. And to feed the hungry. There is more grain in the granaries now than Tear could sell, and the farmers will harvest as much more this year, unless you disobey me. Wagons will carry it north behind the armies, and those <span class="calibre18">peasants</span> . . . those <span class="calibre18">peasants</span> will not have to eat bark any longer, my <span class="calibre18">Lord</span> Meilan.” The tall High Lord opened his mouth again, and Rand swung <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> down, grounding its crystal point in front of him. “You have a question, Meilan?” Shaking his head, Meilan backed into the crowd as though trying to hide.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I knew he would not start a war,” Egwene said fiercely. “I knew it.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You think there will be less killing in this?” Moiraine muttered. What was the boy up to? At least he was not running off to save his village while the Forsaken had their way with the rest of the world. “The corpses will be piled as high, girl. You will not know the difference between this and a war.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Attacking Illian and Sammael would have gained him time even if it grew into a stalemate. Time to learn his power, and perhaps to bring down one of his strongest enemies, to cow the rest. What did he gain by this?
Peace for the land of her birth, starving Cairhienin fed; she would have applauded another time. It was laudably humane—and utterly senseless, now. Useless bloodshed, rather than confronting an enemy who would destroy him given the slightest opening. Why? Lanfear. What had Lanfear said to him? What had she done? The possibilities chilled Moiraine’s heart. Rand would take closer watching than ever now. She would not allow him to turn to the Shadow.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Ah, yes,” Rand said as if just remembering something. “Soldiers don’t know much about feeding hungry people, do they? For that, I think a kind, woman’s heart is needed. My Lady Alteima, I regret intruding on your grief, but will you undertake to oversee distributing the food? You will have a nation to feed.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">And power to gain</span>, Moiraine thought. This was his first slip. Aside from deciding on Cairhien over Illian, of course. Alteima would certainly return to Tear on an equal footing with Meilan or Gueyam, ready for more plotting. She would have Rand assassinated before that, if he was not careful. Perhaps an accident could be arranged in Cairhien.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Alteima swept a graceful curtsy, spreading her full white skirts, only a touch of her surprise showing. “As my Lord Dragon commands, so do I obey. It will please me greatly to serve the Lord Dragon.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I was sure it would,” Rand said wryly. “As much as you love your husband, you’ll not want him with you in Cairhien. Conditions will be hard, for a sick man. I took the liberty of having him moved to the High Lady Estanda’s apartments. She will care for him while you are away, and send him to meet you in Cairhien when he is well.” Estanda smiled, a tight smile of triumph. Alteima’s eyes rolled back in her head, and she crumpled in a heap.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine shook her head slightly. He truly was harder than he had been. More dangerous. Egwene started toward the fallen woman, but Moiraine put a hand on her arm. “I think she was only overcome by emotion. I can recognize it, you see. The ladies are tending her.” Several of them had clustered around, patting Alteima’s wrists and passing smelling salts under her nose. She coughed and opened her eyes, and looked ready to faint again when she saw Estanda standing over her.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Rand just did something very clever, I think,” Egwene said in a flat voice. “And very cruel. He has a right to look ashamed.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand did look it at that, grimacing at the floorstones under his boots. Perhaps he was not as hard as he was trying to be.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Not undeserved, however,” Moiraine observed. The girl showed promise,
picking up on what she did not understand. But she still needed to learn to control her emotions, to see what had to be done as well as she saw what she wished could be done. “Let us hope he is finished with being clever for today.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Very few in the great chamber understood exactly what had happened, only that Alteima’s fainting had upset the Lord Dragon. A few in the back raised shouts of “Cairhien shall fall!” but the cry did not take hold.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“With you to lead us, my Lord Dragon, we shall conquer the world!” a lumpy-faced young man shouted, half-supporting Torean. Estean, Torean’s eldest son; the lumpy-faced resemblance was clear, though the father was still mumbling to himself.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Jerking his head up, Rand appeared startled. Or perhaps angry. “I will not be with you. I am . . . going away for a time.” That certainly brought silence again. Every eye was on him, but his attentions were all on <span class="calibre18">Callandor.</span> The crowd flinched as he lifted the crystal blade before his face. Sweat rolled down his face, much more sweat than before. “The Stone held <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> before I came. The Stone should hold it again, until I return.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Suddenly the transparent sword blazed in his hands. Whirling it hilt uppermost, he drove it down. Into the stone floor. Bluish lightning arced wildly toward the dome above. The stone rumbled loudly, and the Stone shook, dancing, heaving screaming people from their feet.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine pushed Egwene off of her while tremors still reverberated through the chamber, and scrambled erect. What <span class="calibre18">had</span> he done? And why? Going away? It was the worst of all her nightmares.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Aiel had already regained their feet. Everyone else lay stunned or huddled on hands and knees. Except for Rand. He was on one knee, both hands holding <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>’s hilt, with the blade driven halfway into the floorstones. The sword was clear crystal again. Sweat glistened on his face. He pried his hands away one finger at a time, held them cupped around the hilt yet not touching it. For a moment Moiraine thought he was going to take hold of it again, but instead he forced himself to his feet. He did have to force himself; she was certain of it.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Look at this while I am gone.” His voice was lighter, more the way it had been when she first found him in his village, but no less sure or firm than it had been moments before. “Look at it, and remember me. Remember I will come back for it. If anyone wants to take my place, all they have to do is pull it out.” He waggled a finger at them, grinning almost mischievously. “But remember the price of failure.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Turning on his heel, he marched out of the chamber, the Aiel falling in behind him. Staring at the sword rising out of the floor of the Heart, the Tairens got to their feet more slowly. Most looked ready to run, but too frightened to.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“That man!” Egwene grumbled, dusting off her green linen dress. “Is he mad?” She clapped a hand to her mouth. “Oh, Moiraine, he isn’t, is he? Is he? Not yet.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The Light send he is not,” Moiraine muttered. She could not take her eyes from the sword any more than the Tairens could. The Light take the boy. Why could he not have remained the amenable youngling she had found in Emond’s Field? She made herself start after Rand. “But I will find out.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Half-running, they caught up quickly in a broad, tapestry-lined hallway. The Aiel, veils hanging loose now but easily raised if needed, moved aside without slowing. They glanced at her, and at Egwene, hard faces unchanging but eyes touched by the wariness Aiel always had around Aes Sedai.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">How they could be uneasy at her while calmly following Rand, she did not understand. Learning more than fragments about them was difficult. They answered questions freely—about anything that was of no interest to her. Her informants and her own eavesdropping overheard nothing, and her network of eyes-and-ears would no longer try. Not since one woman had been left bound and gagged, hanging by her ankles from battlements and staring wild-eyed at the four-hundred-foot drop beneath her, and not since the man who had simply disappeared. The man was just gone; the woman, refusing to go higher than the ground floor, had been a constant reminder until Moiraine sent her into the country.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand did not slow down any more than the Aiel when she and Egwene fell in on either side of him. His glance was wary, too, but in a different way, and touched with exasperated anger. “I thought you were gone,” he said to Egwene. “I thought you went with Elayne and Nynaeve. You should have. Even Tanchico is . . . . Why did you stay?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I won’t be staying much longer,” Egwene said. “I am going to the Waste with Aviendha, to Rhuidean, to study with the Wise Ones.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He missed a step as the girl mentioned the Waste, glancing at her uncertainly, then strode on. He seemed composed now, too much so, a boiling teakettle with the lid strapped down and the spout plugged. “Do you remember swimming in the Waterwood?” he said quietly. “I used to float on
my back in a pool and think the hardest thing I’d ever have to do was plow a field, unless maybe it was shearing sheep. Shearing from sunup till bedtime, hardly stopping to eat until the clip was in.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Spinning,” Egwene said. “I hated it worse than scrubbing floors. Twisting the threads makes your fingers so sore.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Why did you do it?” Moiraine demanded before they could go on with this childhood reminiscing.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He gave her a sidelong look, and a smile mocking enough to belong to Mat. “Could I really have hung her, for trying to kill a man who was plotting to kill me? Would there be more justice in that than in what I did?” The grin slid from his face. “Is there justice in anything I do? Sunamon will hang if he fails. Because I said so. He’ll deserve it after the way he’s tried to take advantage, with never a care if his own people starved, but he’ll not go to the gallows for that. He will hang because I said he would. Because I said it.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene laid a hand on his arm, but Moiraine would not allow him to sidestep. “You know that is not what I mean.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He nodded; this time his smile had a frightening, rictus quality. “<span class="calibre18">Callandor.</span> With that in my hands, I can do anything. Anything. I know I can do anything. But now, it’s a weight off my shoulders. You don’t understand, do you?” She did not, though it nettled her that he saw it. She kept silent, and he went on. “Perhaps it will help if you know it comes from the Prophecies.</span></div>
<br class="calibre8"/><div class="blocktext"><div class="p-br-blocktext"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">“Into the heart he thrusts his sword,</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">into the heart, to hold their hearts.</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">Who draws it out shall follow after,</span> <br class="calibre8"/><span class="calibre18">What hand can grasp that fearful blade?</span></span></div></div><br class="calibre8"/>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You see? Straight from the Prophecies.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You forget one thing,” she told him tightly. “You drew <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> in fulfillment of prophecy. The safeguards that held it awaiting you for three thousand years and more are gone. It is the Sword That Cannot Be Touched no longer. I could channel it free myself. Worse, any of the Forsaken could. What if Lanfear returns? She could use <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> no more than I, but she could take it.” He did not react to the name. Because he did not fear her—in which case he was a fool—or for another reason? “If Sammael or Rahvin or any male Forsaken puts his hand on <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>, he can wield it as
well as you. Think of facing the power you give up so casually. Think of that power in the hands of the Shadow.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I almost hope they’ll try.” A threatening light shone in his eyes; they seemed gray storm clouds. “There is a surprise awaiting anyone who tries to channel <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> out of the Stone, Moiraine. Do not think of taking it to the Tower for safekeeping; I could not make the trap pick and choose. The Power is all it needs to spring and reset, ready to trap again. I am not giving <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> up forever. Just until I . . . .” He took a deep breath. “<span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> will stay there until I come back for it. By being there, reminding them of who I am and what I am, it makes sure I can come back without an army. A haven of sorts, with the likes of Alteima and Sunamon to welcome me home. If Alteima survives the justice her husband and Estanda will mete out, and Sunamon survives mine. Light, what a wretched tangle.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He could not make it selective, or would not? She was determined not to underrate what he might be capable of. <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> belonged in the Tower, if he would not wield it as he should, in the Tower till he would wield it. “Just until” what? He had been intending to say something other than “until I come back.” But what?</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“And where are you going? Or do you mean to keep it a mystery?” She was quietly vowing not to let him escape again, to turn him somehow if he meant to go running off to the Two Rivers, when he surprised her.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Not a mystery, Moiraine. Not from you and Egwene, anyway.” He looked at Egwene and said one word. “Rhuidean.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Wide-eyed, the girl appeared as astounded as if she had never heard the name before. For that matter, Moiraine felt scarcely less. There was a murmur among the Aiel, but when she glanced back they were striding along with no expression whatsoever. She wished she could make them leave, but they would not go at her command, and she would not ask Rand to send them away. It would not help her with him to ask favors, especially when he might well refuse.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You are not an Aiel clan chief, Rand,” she said firmly, “and have no need to be one. Your struggle is on this side of the Dragonwall. Unless . . . . Does this come from your answers in the <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal</span>? Cairhien, and <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>, and Rhuidean? I told you those answers can be cryptic. You could be misunderstanding them, and that could prove fatal. To more than you.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You must trust me, Moiraine. As I have so often had to trust you.”
His face might as well have belonged to an Aiel for all she could read in it.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I will trust you for now. Just do not wait to seek my guidance until it is too late.” <span class="calibre18">I will not let you go to the Shadow. I have worked too long to allow that. Whatever it takes.</span></span></div>
