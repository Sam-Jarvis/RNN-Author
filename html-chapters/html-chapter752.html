<p class="tni">“Lord Logain and Taim have indeed patched up their differences,” Welyn said, sitting inside the common room of The Great Gathering. He wore bells in his dark braids, and he smiled widely. He always had smiled too much. “Both were worried about the division we’ve been suffering and agree it isn’t good for morale. We need to be focused on the Last Battle. This isn’t a time for squabbling.”</p>
<p class="tx">Androl stood just inside the door, Pevara beside him. It was surprising, how quickly this building—a former warehouse—had been transformed into a tavern. Lind had done her work well. There were a respectable bar and stools, and though the tables and chairs spread through the room didn’t match yet, the place could seat dozens. She also had a library with a considerable number of books, although she was very particular about who she allowed to use it. On the second floor, she planned private dining chambers and sleeping rooms for visitors to the Black Tower. Assuming Taim started letting visitors in again.</p>
<p class="tx">The room was quite packed, and the crowd included a large number of newer recruits, men who didn’t yet fall on either side of the growing dispute—either with Taim and his men, or with those loyal to Logain.</p>
<p class="tx">Androl listened to Welyn, feeling chilled. Welyn’s Aes Sedai, Jenare, sat beside him, hand resting fondly on his arm. Androl didn’t know her well, but he <span class="epub-i1">did</span> know Welyn. And this thing with Welyn’s face and voice was <span class="epub-i1">not</span> the same man.</p>
<p class="tx">“We met with the Lord Dragon,” Welyn continued. “Surveying the Borderlands, preparing for humankind’s assault against the Shadow. He has rallied the armies of all nations to his banner. There are none who do not support him, other than the Seanchan, of course—but they have been driven back.</p>
<p class="tx">“This is the time, and we will soon be called upon to strike. We need to focus one last time on our skills. The Sword and Dragon will be awarded liberally in the next two weeks. Work hard, and we will be the weapons that break the Dark One’s hold upon this land.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You say Logain is coming,” a voice demanded. “Why isn’t he back yet?”</p>
<p class="tx">Androl turned. Jonneth Dowtry stood near Welyn’s table. With his arms folded, glowering at Welyn, Jonneth was an intimidating sight. The Two Rivers man often had a friendly way about him, and it was easy to forget that he stood a head taller than you and had arms like those of a bear. He wore his black Asha’man coat, though it had no pins on the high collar—despite the fact that he was as strong in the One Power as any Dedicated.</p>
<p class="tx">“Why isn’t he here?” Jonneth demanded. “You said that you returned with him, that he and Taim have spoken. Well, where is he?”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Don’t push, lad,</span> Androl thought. <span class="epub-i1">Let him think we believe his lies!</span></p>
<p class="tx">“He took the M’Hael to visit the Lord Dragon,” Welyn said. “Both should be back on the morrow, the day after at the latest.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Why did Taim need Logain to show him the way?” Jonneth said stubbornly. “He could have gone on his own.”</p>
<p class="tx">“That boy is a fool,” Pevara hissed.</p>
<p class="tx">“He’s honest,” Androl replied quietly, “and he wants honest answers.” These Two Rivers lads were a good lot—straightforward and loyal. They weren’t particularly practiced in subterfuge, however.</p>
<p class="tx">Pevara fell silent, but Androl could <span class="epub-i1">feel</span> her as she considered channeling and hushing Jonneth with some bindings of Air. They weren’t serious thoughts, just idle fancies, but Androl could sense them. Light! What had they done to one another?</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">She’s in my head,</span> he thought. <span class="epub-i1">There’s an Aes Sedai, inside my head.</span></p>
<p class="tx">Pevara froze, then glanced at him.</p>
<p class="tx">Androl sought the void, that old soldier’s trick to help him seek clarity before a battle. <span class="epub-i1">Saidin</span> was there, too, of course. He didn’t reach for it.</p>
<p class="tx">“What did you do?” Pevara whispered. “I can feel you there, but sensing your thoughts is harder.”</p>
<p class="tx">Well, that was something at least.</p>
<p class="tx">“Jonneth,” Lind called across the common room, interrupting the lad’s next question to Welyn. “Didn’t you hear the man saying how much traveling he’s been doing? He’s exhausted. Let him drink his ale and rest a spell before you pry stories out of him.”</p>
<p class="tx">Jonneth glanced at her, looking hurt. Welyn smiled deeply as the lad withdrew, pushing his way out of the common room. Welyn continued talking about how well the Lord Dragon was doing, and about how much each of them would be needed.</p>
<p class="tx">Androl released the void, feeling more relaxed. He looked around the room, trying to judge who in here he could rely upon. He liked many of these men, and many weren’t completely for Taim, yet he still couldn’t trust them. Taim had complete control of the Tower now, and private lessons with him and his chosen were coveted by the newcomers. Only the Two Rivers lads could be counted on to give any sort of support to Androl’s cause—and most of them other than Jonneth were too unpracticed to be of use.</p>
<p class="tx">Evin had joined Nalaam on the other side of the room, and Androl nodded his head to him, sending him out to follow Jonneth into the storm. Nobody was to be alone. That done, Androl listened to Welyn’s boasting, and noticed Lind picking her way through the crowd toward him.</p>
<p class="tx">Lind Taglien was a short, dark-haired woman; her dress was covered in lovely embroidery. She had always seemed to him a model of what the Black Tower <span class="epub-i1">could</span> be. Civilized. Educated. Important.</p>
<p class="tx">Men made way for her; they knew not to spill their drinks or start fights in her inn. Lind’s anger was not something a wise man ever wanted to know. It was a good thing she ran the place so tightly. In a city full of male channelers, a simple tavern brawl could potentially go very, very wrong.</p>
<p class="tx">“Does this bother you as much as it does me?” Lind asked softly as she stepped up beside him. “Wasn’t he the one who, just a few weeks back, was talking about how Taim should be tried and executed for some of the things he’d done?”</p>
<p class="tx">Androl didn’t reply. What could he say? That he suspected that the man they’d known as Welyn was dead? That the entire Black Tower would soon be nothing but these monsters with the wrong eyes, the false smiles, the dead souls?</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t believe him about Logain,” Lind said. “Something’s going on here, Androl. I’m going to have Frask follow him tonight, see where he—”</p>
<p class="tx">“No,” Androl said. “No. Don’t.” Frask was her husband, a man who had been hired to help Henre Haslin teach swordsmanship in the Black Tower. Taim thought that swordfighting was useless for Asha’man, but the Lord Dragon had insisted that the men be taught.</p>
<p class="tx">She eyed him. “You’re not saying you believe—”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m saying that we’re in great danger right now, Lind, and I don’t want Frask making it worse. Do me a favor. Take note of what else Welyn says tonight. Maybe some of it will be useful for me to know.”</p>
<p class="tx">“All right,” she said, sounding skeptical.</p>
<p class="tx">Androl nodded toward Nalaam and Canler, who rose and headed over. Rain beat against the rooftop and the porch outside. Welyn kept right on talking, and the men were listening. Yes, it was incredible that he’d swapped sides so quickly, and that would make some suspicious. But many people respected him, and the way he was <span class="epub-i1">off</span> just slightly wasn’t noticeable unless you knew him.</p>
<p class="tx">“Lind,” Androl said as she started to walk away.</p>
<p class="tx">She glanced back at him.</p>
<p class="tx">“You … lock this place up tightly tonight. Then maybe you and Frask should find your way into the cellar with some supplies, all right? You have a sturdy cellar door?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes,” she said. “For all the good it will do.” It wouldn’t matter how thick a door was if someone with the One Power came looking.</p>
<p class="tx">Nalaam and Canler reached them, and Androl turned to go, only to run directly into a man standing in the doorway behind him, someone he hadn’t heard approach. Rain dripped from his Asha’man coat, with the Sword and the Dragon on the high collar. Atal Mishraile had been one of Taim’s from the start. He didn’t have the hollow eyes; his evil was all his own. Tall, with long golden hair, he had a smile that never seemed to reach his eyes.</p>
<p class="tx">Pevara jumped when she saw him, and Nalaam cursed, seizing the One Power.</p>
<p class="tx">“Now, now,” a voice said. “No need for strife.” Mezar stepped in from the rain beside Mishraile. The short Domani man had graying hair and an air of wisdom to him, despite his transformation.</p>
<p class="tx">Androl met Mezar’s eyes, and it was like looking into a deep cavern. A place where light had never shone.</p>
<p class="tx">“Hello, Androl,” Mezar said, putting a hand on Mishraile’s shoulder, as if the two had been friends for a long time. “Why is it that Goodwoman Lind would need to fear, and shut herself in her cellar? Surely the Black Tower is as safe a place as there is?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t trust a dark night full of storms,” Androl said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Perhaps that is wise,” Mezar replied. “Yet you go out into it. Why not stay where it is warm? Nalaam, I should like to hear one of your stories. Perhaps you could tell me of the time your father and you visited Shara?”</p>
<p class="tx">“It’s not that good a story,” Nalaam said. “I don’t know if I remember it that well.”</p>
<p class="tx">Mezar laughed, and Androl heard Welyn stand up behind him. “Ah, there you are! I was telling them you’d talk about defenses in Arafel.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Come listen,” Mezar said. “This will be important for the Last Battle.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Maybe I will return,” Androl said, voice cool. “Once my other work is done.”</p>
<p class="tx">The two stared at one another. To the side, Nalaam still held the One Power. He was as strong as Mezar, but would never be able to face both him and Mishraile—particularly not in a room crammed with people who would probably take the side of the two full Asha’man.</p>
<p class="tx">“Don’t waste your time with the pageboy, Welyn,” Coteren said from behind. Mishraile stepped aside to make room for this third newcomer. The bulky, beady-eyed man pressed a hand against Androl’s chest and shoved him aside as he passed. “Oh, wait. You can’t play pageboy anymore, can you?”</p>
<p class="tx">Androl entered the void and seized the Source.</p>
<p class="tx">Shadows immediately started moving in the room. Lengthening.</p>
<p class="tx">There weren’t enough lights! Why didn’t they light more lamps? The darkness invited those shadows in, and he could <span class="epub-i1">see</span> them. These were real, each one a tendril of blackness, reaching for him. To pull him into them, to destroy him.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Oh, Light. I’m mad. I’m mad … </span></p>
<p class="tx">The void shattered, and the shadows—thankfully—retreated. He found himself shaking, pulling back against the wall, panting. Pevara watched him with an expressionless face, but he could feel her concern.</p>
<p class="tx">“Oh, by the way,” Coteren said. He was one of Taim’s most influential toadies. “Have you heard?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Heard what?” Androl managed to force out.</p>
<p class="tx">“You’ve been demoted, pageboy,” Coteren said, pointing toward the sword pin. “Taim’s orders. As of today. Back to soldier you go, Androl.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Oh, yes,” Welyn called from the center of the room. “I’m sorry I forgot to mention it. It <span class="epub-i1">has</span> been cleared with the Lord Dragon, I’m afraid. You never should have been promoted, Androl. Sorry.”</p>
<p class="tx">Androl reached to his neck, to the pin there. It shouldn’t matter to him; what did it really mean?</p>
<p class="tx">But it <span class="epub-i1">did</span> matter. He’d spent his entire life searching. He’d apprenticed to a dozen different professions. He’d fought in revolts, sailed two seas. All the while searching, searching for something he hadn’t been able to define.</p>
<p class="tx">He’d found it when he’d come to the Black Tower.</p>
<p class="tx">He pushed through the fear. Shadows be <span class="epub-i1">burned</span>! He seized <span class="epub-i1">saidin</span> again, the Power flooding him. He straightened up, going eye-to-eye with Coteren.</p>
<p class="tx">The larger man smiled and seized the One Power as well. Mezar joined him, and in the middle of the room, Welyn stood. Nalaam was whispering to himself in worry, eyes darting back and forth. Canler seized <span class="epub-i1">saidin</span> and looked resigned.</p>
<p class="tx">Everything Androl could hold—all of the One Power he could muster—flooded into him. It was minuscule compared to the others. He was the weakest man in the room; the newest of recruits could manage more than he could.</p>
<p class="tx">“Are you going to make a go of it, then?” Coteren asked softly. “I asked them to leave you, because I knew you’d try it eventually. I wanted the satisfaction, pageboy. Come on. Strike. Let’s see it.”</p>
<p class="tx">Androl reached out, trying to do the one thing he could do, form a gateway. To him, this was something beyond weaves. It was just him and the Power, something intimate, something <span class="epub-i1">instinctive</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">Trying to make a gateway now felt like trying to scramble up a hundred-foot glass wall with only his fingernails to give him purchase. He leaped, scrambled, <span class="epub-i1">tried</span>. Nothing happened. He felt so close: if he could just push a little harder, he could … </p>
<p class="tx">The shadows lengthened. The panic rose in him again. Teeth gritted, Androl reached to his collar and ripped the pin free. He dropped it on the floorboards before Coteren with a clink. Nobody in the room spoke.</p>
<p class="tx">Then, burying his shame under a mountain of determination, he released the One Power and pushed past Mezar into the night. Nalaam, Canler and Pevara followed with anxious steps.</p>
<p class="tx">The rain washed over Androl. He felt the loss of that pin as he might have felt the loss of a hand.</p>
<p class="tx">“Androl…” Nalaam said. “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="tx">Thunder rumbled. They splashed through muddy puddles on the unpaved street. “It doesn’t matter,” Androl said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Maybe we should have fought,” Nalaam said. “Some of the lads in there would have supported us; they’re not all in his pocket. Once, Father and I, we fought down six Darkhounds—Light upon my grave, we did. If we survived that, we can deal with a few Asha’man dogs.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We’d have been slaughtered,” Androl said.</p>
<p class="tx">“But—”</p>
<p class="tx">“We’d have been <span class="epub-i1">slaughtered</span>!” Androl said. “We don’t let them pick the battlefield, Nalaam.”</p>
<p class="tx">“But there will be a battle?” Canler asked, catching up to Androl on the other side.</p>
<p class="tx">“They have Logain,” Androl said. “They wouldn’t make the promises they’re making unless they did. Everything dies—our rebellion, our chances at a unified Black Tower—if we lose him.”</p>
<p class="tx">“So…”</p>
<p class="tx">“So we’re going to rescue him,” Androl said, continuing forward. “Tonight.”</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Rand worked by the soft, steady light of a <span class="epub-i1">saidin</span> globe. Before Dragonmount, he’d begun avoiding this kind of common use of the One Power. Seizing it had made him sick, and using it had revolted him more and more.</p>
<p class="tx">That had changed. <span class="epub-i1">Saidin</span> was part of him, and he needed to fear it no longer, now that the taint was gone. More importantly, he had to stop thinking of it—and of himself—as merely a weapon.</p>
<p class="tx">He would work by globes of light whenever he could. He intended to go to Flinn to learn Healing. He had little skill in it, but a little skill could save the life of someone wounded. All too often, Rand had used this wonder—this gift—only to destroy or kill. Was it any wonder that people looked upon him with fear? What would Tam say?</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">I guess I could ask him,</span> Rand thought idly as he made a notation to himself on a piece of paper. It was still hard to get used to the idea of Tam being there, just one camp over. Rand had dined with him earlier. It had been awkward, but no more so than expected for a king inviting his father from a rural village to “dine.” They had laughed about it, which had made him feel much better.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand had let Tam return to Perrin’s camp rather than seeing him given honors and wealth. Tam didn’t want to be hailed as the Dragon Reborn’s father. He wanted to be what he’d always been—Tam al’Thor, a solid, dependable man by anyone’s measure, but not a lord.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand went back to the document in front of him. Clerks in Tear had advised him on the proper language, but he had done the actual writing; he hadn’t trusted any other hand—or any other eyes—with this document.</p>
<p class="tx">Was he being too careful? What his enemies could not anticipate, they could not work against. He had grown too distrustful after Semirhage had nearly captured him. He recognized this. However, he’d been holding secrets close to him for so long, it was difficult to let them out.</p>
<p class="tx">He started at the top of the document, rereading. Once, Tam had sent Rand to examine a fence for weak spots. Rand had done so, but when he’d returned, Tam had sent him on the same duty again.</p>
<p class="tx">It hadn’t been until the third pass that Rand had found the loose post that needed replacing. He still didn’t know if Tam had known about the post, or if his father had just been being his careful self.</p>
<p class="tx">This document was far more important than a fence. Rand would look it over a dozen more times this night, searching for problems he had not foreseen.</p>
<p class="tx">Unfortunately, it was hard to concentrate. The women were up to something. He could feel them through the balls of emotion in the back of his mind. There were four of those—Alanna was still there, somewhere to the north. The other three had been near to one another all night; now they’d made their way almost to his tent. What <span class="epub-i1">were</span> they up to? It—</p>
<p class="tx">Wait. One of them had split off from the others. She was nearly here. Aviendha?</p>
<p class="tx">Rand stood up, walking to the front of his tent and throwing back the flaps.</p>
<p class="tx">She froze in place just outside, as if she’d been intending to sneak into his tent. She raised her chin, meeting his eyes.</p>
<p class="tx">Suddenly, shouts rose in the night. For the first time, he noticed that his guards were not in attendance. However, the Maidens made camp near his tent, and they appeared to be shouting at him. Not with joy, as he’d expected. Insults. Terrible ones. Several were screaming about what they’d do to certain parts of his body when they caught him.</p>
<p class="tx">“What is this?” he murmured.</p>
<p class="tx">“They don’t mean it,” Aviendha said. “It is a symbol to them of you taking me away from their ranks—but I have already left their ranks to join the Wise Ones. It is a … thing of the Maidens. It is actually a sign of respect. If they did not like you, they would not act this way.”</p>
<p class="tx">Aiel. “Wait,” he said. “How have I taken you from them?”</p>
<p class="tx">Aviendha looked him in the eyes, but color rose in her cheeks. Aviendha? Blushing? That was unexpected.</p>
<p class="tx">“You should understand already,” she said. “If you’d paid attention to what I told you about us…”</p>
<p class="tx">“Unfortunately, you had a complete woolhead of a student.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It is fortunate for him that I have decided to extend my training.” She took a step closer. “There are many things I still need to teach.” Her blush deepened.</p>
<p class="tx">Light. She was beautiful. But so was Elayne … and so was Min … and … </p>
<p class="tx">He was a fool. A Light-blinded fool.</p>
<p class="tx">“Aviendha,” he said. “I love you, I truly do. But that’s a problem, burn it! I love all <span class="epub-i1">three</span> of you. I don’t think I could accept this and choose—”</p>
<p class="tx">Suddenly, she was laughing. “You <span class="epub-i1">are</span> a fool, aren’t you, Rand al’Thor?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Often. But what—”</p>
<p class="tx">“We are first-sisters, Rand al’Thor, Elayne and I. When we get to know her better, Min will join us. We three will share in all things.”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">First-sisters?</span> He should have suspected, following that odd bonding. He raised a hand to his head. <span class="epub-i1">We</span> will <span class="epub-i1">share you,</span> they had said to him.</p>
<p class="tx">Leaving four bonded women to their pains was bad enough, but three bonded women who loved him? Light, he did not want to bring them pain!</p>
<p class="tx">“They say you have changed,” Aviendha said. “So many have spoken of it in the short time since my return that almost, I grow weary of hearing about you. Well, your face may be calm, but your emotions are not. Is this so terrible a thing to consider, being with the three of us?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I want it, Aviendha. I should hide myself because I do. But the pain…”</p>
<p class="tx">“You have embraced it, have you not?”</p>
<p class="tx">“It is not my pain I fear. It is yours.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Are we so weak, then, that we cannot bear what you can?”</p>
<p class="tx">That look in her eyes was unnerving.</p>
<p class="tx">“Of course not,” Rand said. “But how can I hope for pain in those I love?”</p>
<p class="tx">“The pain is ours to accept,” she said, raising her chin. “Rand al’Thor, your decision is simple, though you strive to make it difficult. Choose yes or no. Be warned; it is all three of us, or none of us. We will not let you come between us.”</p>
<p class="tx">He hesitated, then—feeling a complete lecher—he kissed her. Behind him, Maidens he hadn’t realized were watching began to yell louder insults, though he could now hear an incongruous joy to them. He pulled back from the kiss, then reached out, cupping the side of Aviendha’s face with his hand. “You’re bloody fools. All three of you.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Then it is well. We are your equals. You should know that I am a Wise One now.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Then perhaps we are not equals,” Rand said, “for I’ve only just begun to understand how little wisdom I possess.”</p>
<p class="tx">Aviendha sniffed. “Enough talk. You will bed me now.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Light!” he said. “A little forward, aren’t you? Is that the Aiel way of doing things?”</p>
<p class="tx">“No,” she said, blushing again. “I just … I am not very skilled with this.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You three decided this, didn’t you? Which of you came to me?”</p>
<p class="tx">She hesitated, then nodded.</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m never going to get to choose, am I?”</p>
<p class="tx">She shook her head.</p>
<p class="tx">He laughed and pulled her close. She was stiff, initially, but then melted against him. “So, do I go fight them first?” He nodded toward the Maidens.</p>
<p class="tx">“That is only for the wedding, if we decide you are worth marriage, fool man. And it would be our families, not members of our society. You really did ignore your lessons, didn’t you?”</p>
<p class="tx">He looked down at her. “Well, I’m glad there’s no fighting to do. I’m not sure how much time we have, and I was hoping to get some sleep tonight. Still…” He trailed off at the look in her eyes. “I’m … not getting any sleep, am I?”</p>
<p class="tx">She shook her head.</p>
<p class="tx">“Ah, well. At least I don’t have to worry about you freezing to death this time.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes. But it may happen that I die of boredom, Rand al’Thor, if you do not stop rambling.”</p>
<p class="tx">She took him by the arm and gently, but firmly, pulled him back into his tent—the calls of the Maidens growing louder, more insulting and more exuberant all at the same time.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">“I suspect the reason is some kind of <span class="epub-i1">ter’angreal</span>,” Pevara said. She crouched with Androl in the back room of one of the Black Tower’s general storehouses, and she did not find the position terribly comfortable. The room smelled of dust, grain and wood. Most buildings in the Black Tower were new, and this was no exception, the cedar boards still fresh.</p>
<p class="tx">“You know of a <span class="epub-i1">ter’angreal</span> that could prevent gateways?” Androl asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“Not specifically, no,” Pevara replied, shifting to a better position. “But it is generally accepted that what we know of <span class="epub-i1">ter’angreal</span> comprises only the smallest portion of what was once known. There must be thousands of different types of <span class="epub-i1">ter’angreal</span>, and if Taim is a Darkfriend, he has access to the Forsaken—who could likely explain to him the use and construction of things we can only dream about.”</p>
<p class="tx">“So we need to find this <span class="epub-i1">ter’angreal</span>,” Androl said. “Block it, or at least figure out how it functions.”</p>
<p class="tx">“And escape?” Pevara asked. “Haven’t you already determined that leaving would be a poor choice?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Well … yes,” Androl admitted.</p>
<p class="tx">She concentrated, and could catch glimmers of what he was thinking. She’d heard that the Warder bond allowed an empathic connection. This seemed deeper. He was … yes, he <span class="epub-i1">really</span> wished he could make gateways. He felt disarmed without them.</p>
<p class="tx">“It’s my Talent,” he said begrudgingly. He knew she’d sift out the reason eventually. “I can make gateways. At least, I could.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Really? With your level of strength in the One Power?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Or lack of it?” he asked. She could sense a little of what he was thinking. Though he accepted his weakness, he worried that it made him unfit to lead. A curious mix of self-confidence and self-consciousness.</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes,” he continued. “Traveling requires great strength in the One Power, but I can make large gateways. Before this all went wrong, the largest I ever made was a gateway thirty feet across.”</p>
<p class="tx">Pevara blinked. “Surely you’re exaggerating.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’d show you, if I could.” He seemed completely honest. Either he was telling the truth, or his belief was due to his madness. She remained quiet, uncertain how to approach that.</p>
<p class="tx">“It’s all right,” he said. “I know that there are … things wrong with me. With most of us. You can ask the others about my gateways. There’s a reason Coteren calls me pageboy. It’s because the only thing I’m good at is delivering people from one place to another.”</p>
<p class="tx">“That’s a remarkable Talent, Androl. I’m certain the Tower would <span class="epub-i1">love</span> to study it. I wonder how many people were born with it, but never knew, because the weaves for Traveling were unknown?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m not going to the White Tower, Pevara,” he said, putting an emphasis on the <span class="epub-i1">White</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">She changed the topic. “You long for Traveling, yet you don’t want to leave the Black Tower. So what does this <span class="epub-i1">ter’angreal</span> matter?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Gateways would be … useful,” Androl said.</p>
<p class="tx">He thought something, but she couldn’t catch hold of it. A quick flash of images and impressions.</p>
<p class="tx">“But if we’re not going anywhere…” she protested.</p>
<p class="tx">“You’d be surprised,” he said, raising his head to peer out over the windowsill at the alleyway. It was drizzling outside; the rain had finally let up. The sky was still dark, though. Dawn wouldn’t come for a few hours yet. “I’ve been … experimenting. Trying a few things I don’t think anyone else has ever tried.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I doubt they are things that haven’t <span class="epub-i1">ever</span> been tried,” she said. “The Forsaken had access to the knowledge of Ages.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You really think one might be involved here?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Why not?” she asked. “If you were preparing for the Last Battle and wanted to make certain your enemies couldn’t resist you, would you let a crop of channelers train together, teach one another and become strong?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes,” he said softly. “I would, and then I’d steal them.”</p>
<p class="tx">Pevara closed her mouth. That was probably right. Talking of the Forsaken troubled Androl; she could feel his thoughts, clearer than before.</p>
<p class="tx">This bond was unnatural. She needed to be rid of it. After that, she wouldn’t mind having him properly bonded to her.</p>
<p class="tx">“I will <span class="epub-i1">not</span> take responsibility for this situation, Pevara,” Androl said, again looking out. “You bonded me first.”</p>
<p class="tx">“After you betrayed the trust I gave you by offering a circle.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I didn’t hurt you. What did you <span class="epub-i1">expect</span> to happen? Wasn’t the purpose of a circle to allow us to join our powers?”</p>
<p class="tx">“This argument is pointless.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You only say that because you’re losing.” He said it calmly, and he felt calm as well. She was coming to realize that Androl was a difficult man to rile.</p>
<p class="tx">“I say it because it’s true,” she said. “Do you disagree?”</p>
<p class="tx">She felt his amusement. He saw how she took control of the conversation. And … beside his amusement, he actually seemed impressed. He was thinking that he needed to learn to do what she did.</p>
<p class="tx">The inner door to the room creaked open, and Leish peered in. She was a white-haired woman, round and pleasant, an odd match for the surly Asha’man Canler, to whom she was married. She nodded to Pevara, indicating that half an hour had passed, then shut the door. Canler had reportedly bonded the woman, making her some kind of … what? Female Warder?</p>
<p class="tx">Everything was backward with these men. Pevara supposed she could see the reason for bonding one’s spouse, if only so that each could have the comfort of knowing where the other was, but it felt wrong to use the bond in such a mundane way. This was a thing for Aes Sedai and Warders, not wives and husbands.</p>
<p class="tx">Androl regarded her, obviously trying to figure out what she was thinking—though these thoughts were complex enough to give him trouble. Such an odd man, this Androl Genhald. How did he so fully mix determination and diffidence, like two threads woven together? He did what needed to be done, all the while worrying that he shouldn’t be the one doing it.</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t understand myself either,” he said.</p>
<p class="tx">He was also <span class="epub-i1">infuriating</span>. How had he grown so good at understanding what she was thinking? She still had to fish to figure out his thoughts.</p>
<p class="tx">“Can you think that again?” he asked. “I didn’t catch it.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Idiot,” Pevara muttered.</p>
<p class="tx">Androl smiled, then peeked over the windowsill again.</p>
<p class="tx">“It’s not time,” Pevara said.</p>
<p class="tx">“You’re sure?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes,” she said. “And if you keep peeking, you might scare him off when he actually comes.”</p>
<p class="tx">Androl reluctantly crouched down again.</p>
<p class="tx">“Now,” Pevara said. “When he comes, you have to let me take the lead.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We should link.”</p>
<p class="tx">“No.” She would <span class="epub-i1">not</span> put herself in his hands again. Not after what had happened last time. She shivered, and Androl glanced at her.</p>
<p class="tx">“There are very good reasons,” she said, “for not linking. I don’t mean to insult you, Androl, but your ability isn’t great enough to make the trade worthwhile. Better that there be two of us. You must accept this. On a battlefield, which would you rather have? One soldier? Or two—with one being only slightly less skilled—that you can send on different tasks and duties?”</p>
<p class="tx">He thought about it, then sighed. “All right, fine. You talk sense, this time.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I always talk sense,” she said, rising. “It’s time. Be ready.”</p>
<p class="tx">The two of them moved to either side of the doorway that led out into the alley. It stood open a crack by intention, the sturdy lock on the outside left hanging as if someone had forgotten to close it.</p>
<p class="tx">They waited silently, and Pevara began to worry that her calculations had been off. Androl would have a good laugh about that, and—</p>
<p class="tx">The door pushed open the rest of the way. Dobser poked his head in, lured by Evin’s offhanded comment that he’d nicked a bottle of wine from the back room after finding that Leish had forgotten to lock the door. According to Androl, Dobser was a known drunkard, and Taim had beaten him senseless more than once for getting into the wine.</p>
<p class="tx">She could feel Androl’s reaction to the man. Sadness. Deep, crushing sadness. Dobser had the darkness behind his eyes.</p>
<p class="tx">Pevara struck quickly, tying Dobser in Air and slamming a shield into place between the unsuspecting man and the Source. Androl hefted a cudgel, but it wasn’t needed. Dobser grew wide-eyed as he was hoisted into the air; Pevara put her hands behind her back, regarding him critically.</p>
<p class="tx">“Are you certain about this?” Androl asked softly.</p>
<p class="tx">“Too late now, regardless,” Pevara replied, tying off the weaves of Air. “The accounts <span class="epub-i1">seem</span> to agree. The more dedicated a person was to the Light before being taken, the more dedicated they’ll be to the Shadow after falling. And so…”</p>
<p class="tx">And so this man, who had always been rather lukewarm, <span class="epub-i1">should</span> be easier to break, bribe or convert than others. That was important, as Taim’s lackeys would likely realize what had happened as soon as—</p>
<p class="tx">“Dobser?” a voice asked. Two figures darkened the doorway. “Do you have the wine? No need to watch the front; the woman isn’t—”</p>
<p class="tx">Welyn and another of Taim’s favored, Leems, stood in the doorway.</p>
<p class="tx">Pevara reacted immediately, throwing weaves at the two men while forming a thread of Spirit. They rebuffed her attempts at shielding them—it was tough to get a shield between the Source and a person holding the One Power—but her gags snapped into place, stopping their yells.</p>
<p class="tx">She felt Air wrapping around her, a shield trying to come between her and the Source. She lashed out with Spirit, slicing down the weaves by guessing where they would be.</p>
<p class="tx">Leems stumbled back, looking surprised as his weaves vanished. Pevara threw herself forward, weaving another shield and smashing it between him and the Source as she slammed her body into him, throwing him back against the wall. The distraction worked, and her shield cut him off from the One Power.</p>
<p class="tx">She flung a second shield at Welyn, but he hit her with his own threads of Air. They hurled her backward across the room. She wove Air as she crashed into the wall, grunting. Her vision swam, but she kept hold of that single thread of Air and by instinct, sweeping it forward, grabbed Welyn’s foot as he tried to run out of the building.</p>
<p class="tx">She felt the ground tremble from someone falling. He’d tripped, hadn’t he? Dizzy, she couldn’t see straight.</p>
<p class="tx">She sat up, aching all over, but clung to the threads of Air she’d woven as gags. Let those go, and Taim’s men would be able to scream. If they did that, she died. They all died. Or worse.</p>
<p class="tx">She blinked the tears of pain from her eyes to find Androl standing over the two Asha’man, cudgel in his hand. He’d knocked them both out, it appeared, not trusting in shields he couldn’t see. Good thing, too, as her second shield hadn’t gotten into place. She set it now.</p>
<p class="tx">Dobser still hung where she’d put him, his eyes wider now. Androl looked at Pevara. “Light!” he said. “Pevara, that was incredible. You brought down two Asha’man, practically by yourself!”</p>
<p class="tx">She smiled in satisfaction and woozily took Androl’s hand, letting him help her to her feet. “What did you think the Red Ajah does with its time, Androl? Sit around and complain about men? We train to fight other channelers.”</p>
<p class="tx">She felt Androl’s respect as he busied himself, pulling Welyn into the building and shutting the door, then checking at the windows to make certain they hadn’t been seen. He drew the shades quickly, then channeled to make a light.</p>
<p class="tx">Pevara took a breath, then raised a hand and steadied herself against the wall.</p>
<p class="tx">Androl looked up sharply. “We need to take you to one of the others for Healing.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’ll be fine,” she said. “Just took a thump to the head and it has the room shaking. It will wear off.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Let me see,” Androl said, walking over—his light hovering beside him. Pevara allowed him to putter about for a moment, checking her eyes, feeling her head for lumps. He moved his light closer to her eyes. “Does it hurt to look at this?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes,” she admitted, glancing away.</p>
<p class="tx">“Nausea?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Slight.”</p>
<p class="tx">He grunted, then took a handkerchief out of his pocket and poured some water on it from his flask. He adopted a look of concentration, and his light winked out. The handkerchief crackled softly, and when he handed it to her, it was frozen. “Hold this to the wound,” he said. “Tell me if you start to feel drowsy. It could grow worse if you fall asleep.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Are you worried for me?” she asked, amused, doing as he said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Just … what was it you told me earlier? Keeping watch over our assets?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m sure,” she said, pressing the iced bandanna to her head. “So you know field medicine as well?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I apprenticed with a town’s Wise Woman once,” he said absently as he knelt to bind the fallen men. Pevara was glad to release the weaves of Air on them, though she did keep the shields up.</p>
<p class="tx">“A Wise Woman took on a <span class="epub-i1">male</span> apprentice?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Not at first,” Androl said. “It’s … a long story.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Excellent; a long story will keep me from falling asleep until the others come for us.” Emarin and the others had been instructed to go and be seen, establishing an alibi for the group, in case Dobser’s disappearance was noted.</p>
<p class="tx">Androl eyed her, replacing his light. Then he shrugged, continuing his work. “It started when I lost a friend to the fevers during a silverpike run out of Mayene. When I came back to the mainland, I started thinking that we could have saved Sayer if any of us had known what to do. So I went looking for someone who could teach me…”</p>
