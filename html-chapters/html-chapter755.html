<p class="ct"><span class="epub-i">A Knack</span></p>
<p class="tni">The pavilion grew quiet again. Perrin hated a racket, and the people’s scents weren’t any better. Frustration, anger, fear. Terror.</p>
<p class="tx">Much of it was directed at the woman standing just inside the entrance to the pavilion.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Mat, you blessed fool,</span> Perrin thought, breaking into a grin. <span class="epub-i1">You did it. You actually did it.</span></p>
<p class="tx">For the first time in a while, thinking of Mat made the colors swirl in his vision. He saw Mat on a horse, riding along a dusty road, tinkering with something he held. Perrin dismissed the image. Where had Mat gotten to now? Why hadn’t he come back with Moiraine?</p>
<p class="tx">It didn’t matter. Moiraine was back. Light, Moiraine! Perrin started toward her to give her an embrace, but Faile caught him by the sleeve. He followed her eyes.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand. His face had grown pale. He stumbled away from the table, as if all else had been forgotten, and pushed his way to Moiraine. He hesitantly reached out and touched her face. “By my mother’s grave,” Rand whispered, then fell to his knees before her. “How?”</p>
<p class="tx">Moiraine smiled, resting a hand on his shoulder. “The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills, Rand. Have you forgotten that?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I…”</p>
<p class="tx">“Not as you will, Dragon Reborn,” she said gently. “Not as any of us will. Perhaps one day it will weave itself out of existence. I do not believe that day is today, nor a day soon.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Who is this woman?” Roedran said. “And what is she blathering about? I—” He cut off as something unseen flicked him on the side of the head, causing him to jump. Perrin glanced at Rand, then noticed the smile on Egwene’s lips. He caught the scent of her satisfaction despite all of the people in the pavilion.</p>
<p class="tx">Nynaeve and Min, standing nearby, smelled utterly shocked. The Light willing, Nynaeve would stay that way for a little while. Shouting at Moiraine wouldn’t help right now.</p>
<p class="tx">“You haven’t answered my question,” Rand said.</p>
<p class="tx">“But I have,” Moiraine replied fondly. “It just was not the answer you wanted.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand knelt, then threw his head back and laughed. “Light, Moiraine! You haven’t changed, have you?”</p>
<p class="tx">“We all change day by day,” she replied, then smiled. “Me more than some, lately. Stand up. It is I who should be kneeling before you, Lord Dragon. We all should.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand rose and stepped back to allow Moiraine farther into the pavilion. Perrin caught another scent, and smiled as Thom Merrilin slipped into the tent behind her. The old gleeman winked at Perrin.</p>
<p class="tx">“Moiraine,” Egwene said, stepping forward. “The White Tower welcomes you back with open arms. Your service has not been forgotten.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Hmmm,” Moiraine said. “Yes, I should think that having discovered a future Amyrlin would reflect well upon me. That is a relief, as I believe I was on a path to stilling, if not execution, before.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Things have changed.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Obviously.” Moiraine nodded. “Mother.” She passed Perrin, and gave him a squeeze on the arm, eyes twinkling.</p>
<p class="tx">One by one, the Borderlander rulers took swords in hands and bowed or curtsied toward her. Each one seemed to know her personally. Many of the others in the tent still looked baffled, though Darlin obviously knew who she was. He was more … thoughtful than confused.</p>
<p class="tx">Moiraine hesitated beside Nynaeve. Perrin couldn’t catch Nynaeve’s scent right then. That seemed ominous to him. <span class="epub-i1">Oh, Light. Here it comes</span> … </p>
<p class="tx">Nynaeve enfolded Moiraine in a powerful embrace.</p>
<p class="tx">Moiraine stood for a moment, smelling distinctly shocked, hands out to the sides. Finally, she returned the embrace in a somewhat maternal way, patting Nynaeve on the back.</p>
<p class="tx">Nynaeve released her, pulling back, then wiped a tear from her eye. “Don’t you <span class="epub-i1">dare</span> tell Lan about this,” she growled.</p>
<p class="tx">“I would not dream of it,” Moiraine said, moving on to stand in the center of the pavilion.</p>
<p class="tx">“Insufferable woman,” Nynaeve grumbled as she wiped a tear from the other eye.</p>
<p class="tx">“Moiraine,” Egwene said. “You’ve come at just the right time.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I have a knack for that.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Well,” Egwene continued as Rand stepped back up to the table, “Rand … the Dragon Reborn … has decided to hold this land for ransom to his demands, refusing to do his duty unless we agree to his whims.”</p>
<p class="tx">Moiraine pursed her lips, taking up the contract for the Dragon’s Peace as Galad set it on the table for her. She scanned it.</p>
<p class="tx">“Who <span class="epub-i1">is</span> this woman?” Roedran said. “And why do we— Would you stop that!” He raised a hand as if he’d been smacked by a thread of Air, then glared at Egwene—however, this time one of the nearby Asha’man was the one who smelled satisfied.</p>
<p class="tx">“Nice shot, Grady,” Perrin whispered.</p>
<p class="tx">“Thank you, Lord Perrin.”</p>
<p class="tx">Grady would know her only by legend, of course, but tales of Moiraine had spread among those who followed Rand.</p>
<p class="tx">“Well?” Egwene said.</p>
<p class="tx">“‘And it shall come to pass that what men made shall be shattered,’ ” Moiraine whispered. “‘The Shadow shall lie across the Pattern of the Age, and the Dark One shall once more lay his hand upon the world of man. Women shall weep and men quail as the nations of the earth are rent like rotting cloth. Neither shall anything stand nor abide.’ ”</p>
<p class="tx">The people shuffled their feet. Perrin looked questioningly at Rand.</p>
<p class="tx">“‘Yet one shall be born to face the Shadow,’ ” Moiraine said more loudly. “‘Born once more as he was born before and shall be born again, time without end! The Dragon shall be Reborn, and there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth at his rebirth. In sackcloth and ashes shall he clothe the people, and he shall break the world again by his coming, tearing apart all ties that bind!</p>
<p class="tx">“‘Like the unfettered dawn shall he blind us, and burn us, yet shall the Dragon Reborn confront the Shadow at the Last Battle, and his blood shall give us the Light. Let tears flow, O ye people of the world. Weep for your salvation!’ ”</p>
<p class="tx">“Aes Sedai,” Darlin said, “pardon, but that is very ominous.”</p>
<p class="tx">“At least it shall be a salvation,” Moiraine said. “Tell me, Your Majesty. That prophecy commands you to shed tears. Are you to weep because your salvation comes with such pain and worry? Or, instead, are you to weep <span class="epub-i1">for</span> your salvation? For the man who will suffer for you? The only one we know for certain will not walk away from this fight?”</p>
<p class="tx">She turned to Rand.</p>
<p class="tx">“These demands are unfair,” Gregorin said. “He requires us to keep our borders as they are!”</p>
<p class="tx">“‘He shall slay his people with the sword of peace,’ ” Moiraine said, “‘and destroy them with the leaf.’ ”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">It’s</span> The Karaethon Cycle. <span class="epub-i1">I’ve heard these words before.</span></p>
<p class="tx">“The seals, Moiraine,” Egwene said. “He’s planning to break them. He defies the authority of the Amyrlin Seat.”</p>
<p class="tx">Moiraine did not look surprised. Perrin suspected she’d been listening outside before entering. It was very like her.</p>
<p class="tx">“Oh, Egwene,” Moiraine said. “Have you forgotten? ‘The unstained tower breaks and bends knee to the forgotten sign…’ ”</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene blushed.</p>
<p class="tx">“‘There can be no health in us, nor any good thing grow,’ ” Moiraine quoted, “‘for the land is one with the Dragon Reborn, and he one with the land. Soul of fire, heart of stone.’ ”</p>
<p class="tx">She looked to Gregorin. “‘In pride he conquers, forcing the proud to yield.’ ”</p>
<p class="tx">To the Borderlanders. “‘He calls upon the mountains to kneel…’ ”</p>
<p class="tx">To the Sea Folk. “‘… and the seas to give way.’ ”</p>
<p class="tx">To Perrin, then Berelain. “‘… and the very skies to bow.’ ”</p>
<p class="tx">To Darlin. “‘Pray that the heart of stone remembers tears…’ ”</p>
<p class="tx">Then, finally, to Elayne. “‘… and the soul of fire, love.’ You cannot fight this. None of you can. I am sorry. You think he came to this on his own?” She held up the document. “The Pattern is balance. It is not good nor evil, not wisdom nor foolishness. To the Pattern, these things matter not, yet it <span class="epub-i1">will</span> find balance. The last Age ended with a Breaking, and so the next one will begin with peace—even if it must be shoved down your throats like medicine given to a screaming babe.”</p>
<p class="tx">“If I may speak?” An Aes Sedai wearing a brown shawl stepped forward.</p>
<p class="tx">“You may,” Rand said.</p>
<p class="tx">“This is a wise document, Lord Dragon,” the Brown said. She was a stout woman, more direct of tone than Perrin expected from a Brown. “But I see an enormous flaw to it, one that was raised earlier. So long as the Seanchan are exempt from it, it will be meaningless. There will be no peace so long as they conquer.”</p>
<p class="tx">“That’s an issue,” Elayne said, arms folded. “But not the only one. Rand, I see what you’re trying to do, and I love you for it. That does not remove the fact that this document is fundamentally untenable. For a peace treaty to work, both sides must continue to wish for peace because of the benefits presented.</p>
<p class="tx">“This grants no way to settle disputes. They <span class="epub-i1">will</span> arise, they always do. Any document like this must give a way to settle such things; you must set up a way to punish an infraction save for the other countries to enter all-out war. Without that change, little grievances will mount and build pressure over years until they explode.</p>
<p class="tx">“As this is, it all but requires the nations to fall upon the first that breaks the peace. It doesn’t stop them from setting up a puppet regime in the fallen kingdom, or even in another kingdom. Over time, I fear this treaty will be viewed as null; what good is it if it protects only on paper? The end result of this will be war. Massive, overpowering war. You will have peace for a time, particularly while those who revere you live. But for every year of peace you gain, you will earn one of greater destruction once the thing falls apart.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand rested his fingers on the document. “I will make peace with the Seanchan. We will add a provision. If their ruler does not sign, then the document is voided. Will you all agree to it then?”</p>
<p class="tx">“That fixes the lesser problem,” Elayne said softly, “but not the larger one, Rand.”</p>
<p class="tx">“There is yet a greater issue here,” a new voice said.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin turned, surprised. Aviendha? She and the other Aiel had not participated in the arguments. They’d only watched. Perrin had almost forgotten they were there.</p>
<p class="tx">“You, too?” Rand said. “Come to walk on the shards of my dreams, Aviendha?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Don’t be a child, Rand al’Thor,” the woman said, striding up to place her finger on the document. “You have <span class="epub-i1">toh</span>.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I left you out of it,” Rand protested. “I trust you, and all of the Aiel.”</p>
<p class="tx">“The Aiel aren’t in it?” Easar said. “Light, how did we miss that!”</p>
<p class="tx">“It is an insult,” Aviendha said.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin frowned. She smelled very serious. From any other Aiel, he’d expect that sharp scent to be followed by a pulled-up veil and a raised spear.</p>
<p class="tx">“Aviendha,” Rand said, smiling. “The others are about to hang me for putting them in it, and you are angry for being left out?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I demand my boon of you,” she said. “This is it. Place the Aiel in your document, your ‘Dragon’s Peace.’ We will leave you otherwise.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You don’t speak for all of them, Aviendha,” Rand said. “You can’t—”</p>
<p class="tx">All of the tent’s Wise Ones stepped up behind Aviendha, as if in rhythm together. Rand blinked.</p>
<p class="tx">“Aviendha carries our honor,” Sorilea said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Do not be foolish, Rand al’Thor,” Melaine added.</p>
<p class="tx">“This is a thing of the women,” Sarinde added. “We will not be satisfied until we are treated equally with the wetlanders.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Is this thing too difficult for us?” Amys asked. “Do you insult us by implying we are weaker than the others?”</p>
<p class="tx">“You’re all insane!” Rand said. “Do you realize that this would <span class="epub-i1">forbid</span> you from fighting one another?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Not from fighting,” Aviendha said. “From fighting without cause.”</p>
<p class="tx">“War is your purpose,” Rand said.</p>
<p class="tx">“If you believe that, Rand al’Thor,” she said, voice cold, “I have trained you poorly indeed.”</p>
<p class="tx">“She speaks wisdom,” Rhuarc said, stepping up to the front of the crowd. “Our purpose was to prepare for your need of us at this Last Battle—our purpose was to be strong enough to be preserved. We will need another purpose. I have buried blood feuds for you, Rand al’Thor. I would not take them up again. I have friends now that I would rather not kill.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Madness,” Rand said, shaking his head. “All right, I’ll put you in.”</p>
<p class="tx">Aviendha seemed satisfied, but something bothered Perrin. He didn’t understand the Aiel—Light, he didn’t understand Gaul, who had been with him for so long. Still, he’d noticed that the Aiel liked to be doing something. Even when they lounged, they were alert. When other men gamed or diced, the Aiel were often quietly doing something of use.</p>
<p class="tx">“Rand,” Perrin said, stepping up, taking him by the arm. “A moment, please?”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand hesitated, then nodded to him and waved his hand. “We’re sealed off; they can’t hear us now. What is this about?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Well, I just noticed something. The Aiel are like tools.”</p>
<p class="tx">“All right…”</p>
<p class="tx">“And tools that aren’t used grow rusty,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Which is why they raid one another,” Rand said, rubbing his temple. “To keep up their skills. That is why I exempted them. Light, Perrin! I think this is going to be a disaster. If we include them in this document…”</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t think you have a choice, now,” Perrin said. “The others will never sign it if the Aiel are left out.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t know if they’ll sign it anyway,” Rand said. He looked longingly at the sheet on the table. “It was such a beautiful dream, Perrin. A dream of good for humanity. I thought I had them. Right up until Egwene called my bluff, I thought I had them.”</p>
<p class="tx">It was a good thing others couldn’t smell Rand’s emotions, or everyone there would have known that he’d never refuse to go against the Dark One. Rand showed not a hint of it on his face, but inside, Perrin knew he had been as nervous as a boy at his first shearing.</p>
<p class="tx">“Rand, don’t you see?” Perrin said. “The solution.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand frowned at him.</p>
<p class="tx">“The <span class="epub-i1">Aiel</span>,” Perrin said. “The tool that needs to be used. A treaty that needs to be enforced…”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand hesitated, then grinned widely. “You’re a genius, Perrin.”</p>
<p class="tx">“So long as it’s about blacksmithing, I suppose I know a thing or two.”</p>
<p class="tx">“But this … this isn’t about blacksmithing, Perrin…”</p>
<p class="tx">“Of course it is,” Perrin said. How could Rand not see that?</p>
<p class="tx">Rand turned, no doubt ending his weave. He strode up to the document, then held it up toward one of his clerks in the back of the pavilion. “I want two provisions added. First, this document is void if not signed by either the Seanchan Daughter of the Nine Moons or the Empress. Second … the Aiel—all but the Shaido—are to be written into the document as enforcers of the peace and mediators of disputes between nations. Any nation may call upon them if they feel abused, and the Aiel—not enemy armies—will provide redress. They can hunt criminals across national borders. They are to be <span class="epub-i1">subject</span> to the laws of the nations in which they reside at the time, but they are not <span class="epub-i1">subjects</span> of that nation.”</p>
<p class="tx">He turned to Elayne. “There is your enforcement, Elayne, the way to keep your small pressures from building.”</p>
<p class="tx">“The Aiel?” she asked skeptically.</p>
<p class="tx">“Will you agree to this, Rhuarc?” Rand asked. “Bael, Jheran, the rest of you? You claim to be left without purpose, and Perrin sees you as a tool that needs to be worked. Will you take this charge? To prevent war, to punish those who do wrong, to work with the rulers of nations to see justice served?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Justice as we see it, Rand al’Thor,” Rhuarc said, “or as they see it?”</p>
<p class="tx">“It will have to be according to the conscience of the Aiel,” Rand said. “If they call for you, they will have to know that they’ll receive your justice. This will not work if the Aiel simply become pawns. Your autonomy will be what makes this effective.”</p>
<p class="tx">Gregorin and Darlin began to complain, but Rand silenced them with a look. Perrin nodded to himself, arms folded. Their complaints were weaker now than they had been before. He smelled … thoughtfulness from many of them.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">They see this as an opportunity,</span> he realized. <span class="epub-i1">They view the Aiel as savages, and think they’ll be easy to manipulate once Rand is gone.</span> Perrin grinned, imagining their defeat should they attempt that course.</p>
<p class="tx">“This is very sudden,” Rhuarc said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Welcome to the dinner party,” Elayne added, still staring daggers at Rand. “Try the soup.” Oddly, she smelled <span class="epub-i1">proud</span>. Strange woman.</p>
<p class="tx">“I warn you, Rhuarc,” Rand said. “You will need to change your ways. The Aiel will have to act together on these matters; the chiefs and Wise Ones will need to hold council to make decisions together. One clan cannot fight a battle while other clans disagree and fight for the other side.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We will speak of it,” Rhuarc said, nodding to the other Aiel chiefs. “This will mean an end to the Aiel.”</p>
<p class="tx">“A beginning as well,” Rand said.</p>
<p class="tx">The Aiel clan chiefs and the Wise Ones gathered separately to one side, and spoke in soft voices. Aviendha lingered, with Rand staring away, troubled. Perrin heard him whisper something, so soft Perrin’s ears barely made it out.</p>
<p class="tx">“… your dream now … when you wake from this life, we will be no more…”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand’s clerks, smelling frantic, came forward to begin working on the document’s additions. The woman Cadsuane watched all events with a stern expression.</p>
<p class="tx">She smelled extremely proud.</p>
<p class="tx">“Add a provision,” Rand said. “The Aiel can call upon other nations to aid them in their enforcement if they decide that their own numbers will not be enough. Give formal methods by which nations can petition the Aiel for redress or for permission to attack a foe.”</p>
<p class="tx">The clerks nodded, working harder.</p>
<p class="tx">“You act as if this were settled,” Egwene said, eyes on Rand.</p>
<p class="tx">“Oh, it is far from that,” Moiraine said. “Rand, I have some words for you.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Are they words I will like?” he asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“I suspect not. Tell me, why do you need to command the armies yourself? You will be traveling to Shayol Ghul where you will no doubt be unable to contact anyone.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Somebody needs to be in command, Moiraine.”</p>
<p class="tx">“On this point, I believe all would agree.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand folded his arms behind his back, smelling troubled. “I have taken responsibility for this people, Moiraine. I want to see that they’re cared for, that the brutalities of this battle are minimized.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I fear that is a poor reason to lead a battle,” Moiraine said softly. “You do not fight to preserve your troops; you fight to win. This leader need not be you, Rand. It should not be you.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I won’t have this battle turn into a tangle, Moiraine,” he said. “If you could see the mistakes we made last time, the confusion that can result when everyone thinks <span class="epub-i1">they</span> are in control. Battle is turmoil, but we still need an ultimate commander to make decisions, to hold everything together.”</p>
<p class="tx">“What of the White Tower?” Romanda asked, stepping—half shoving—her way up beside Egwene. “We have the resources for efficient travel between battlefronts, we are coolheaded in times that would crush others, and we are trusted by all nations.”</p>
<p class="tx">That last bit prompted a raised eyebrow from Darlin.</p>
<p class="tx">“The White Tower <span class="epub-i1">does</span> seem the optimal choice, Lord Dragon,” Tenobia added.</p>
<p class="tx">“No,” Rand said. “The Amyrlin is many things, but a leader of war … I do not think it a wise choice.”</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene, oddly, said nothing. Perrin studied her. He’d have thought that she’d jump at the chance to lead the war herself.</p>
<p class="tx">“It should be one of us,” Darlin said. “Chosen from those who would go to battle here.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I suppose,” Rand said. “So long as you all know who is in command, I will cede this point. You must meet my other demands, however.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You still insist that you must break the seals?” Egwene said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Do not worry, Egwene,” Moiraine said, smiling. “He is not going to break the seals.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand’s face darkened.</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene smiled.</p>
<p class="tx">“You are going to break them,” Moiraine said to Egwene.</p>
<p class="tx">“What? Of course I’m not!”</p>
<p class="tx">“You are the Watcher of the Seals, Mother,” Moiraine said. “Did you not hear what I said earlier? ‘It shall come to pass that what men made shall be <span class="epub-i1">shattered</span>, and the Shadow shall lie across the Pattern of the Age, and the Dark One shall once more lay his hand upon the world of man…’ It must happen.”</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene seemed troubled.</p>
<p class="tx">“You have seen this, have you not?” Moiraine whispered. “What have you dreamed, Mother?”</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene didn’t respond at first.</p>
<p class="tx">“What did you see?” Moiraine pressed, stepping closer to her.</p>
<p class="tx">“His feet crunching,” Egwene said, staring Moiraine in the eyes. “As he strode forward, Rand’s feet stepped on the shards of the Dark One’s prison. I saw him, in another dream, hacking away at it to open it. But I never actually saw him <span class="epub-i1">opening</span> it, Moiraine.”</p>
<p class="tx">“The shards were there, Mother,” Moiraine said. “The seals had been broken.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Dreams are subject to interpretation.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You know the truth of this one. It does need to be done, and the seals are yours. You will break them, when the time is right. Rand, Lord Dragon Reborn, it is time to give them to her.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t like this, Moiraine,” he said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Then not much has changed, has it?” she asked lightly. “I believe you have often resisted doing what you are supposed to. Particularly when <span class="epub-i1">I</span> am the one to point it out to you.”</p>
<p class="tx">He paused for a moment, then laughed, reaching into the pocket of his coat. He slipped out three discs of <span class="epub-i1">cuendillar</span>, each split by a sinuous line down the center. He set them on the table.</p>
<p class="tx">“How will she know the time?” he asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“She will,” Moiraine said.</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene smelled skeptical, and Perrin didn’t blame her. Moiraine always had believed in following the weave of the Pattern and bowing to the Wheel’s turnings. Perrin didn’t see it that way. He figured you made your own path, and trusted in your own arms to do what needed to be done. The Pattern wasn’t a thing to depend on.</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene was Aes Sedai. It seemed that she felt she should see it as Moiraine did. Either that, or she was willing to agree and just take those seals into her hands. “I’ll break them, when I feel it must be done,” she said, taking the seals.</p>
<p class="tx">“You’ll sign, then.” Rand took the document as the clerks protested the hastiness with which they’d had to work. It now had several additions on the back. One of the clerks cried out, reaching for the sand, but Rand did something with the One Power, drying the ink instantly as he placed the document before Egwene.</p>
<p class="tx">“I will,” she said, holding out a hand for a pen. She read the provisions carefully, the other sisters looking over her shoulders. They nodded one at a time.</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene put pen to paper.</p>
<p class="tx">“And now the rest,” Rand said, turning to measure reactions.</p>
<p class="tx">“Light, he’s grown clever,” Faile whispered beside Perrin. “Do you realize what he did?”</p>
<p class="tx">“What?” Perrin said, scratching his beard.</p>
<p class="tx">“He brought with him all he knew would support him,” Faile whispered. “The Borderlanders, who would sign practically anything to garner help for their homelands. Arad Doman, which he helped most recently. The Aiel … well, all right, who knows what the Aiel will do at a given time? But the idea stands.</p>
<p class="tx">“Then he let Egwene gather the others. It’s genius, Perrin. That way, with her bringing this coalition against him, all he <span class="epub-i1">really</span> had to do was convince her. Once he swayed her to his side, the others would look foolish to stand apart.”</p>
<p class="tx">Indeed, as the rulers began to sign—Berelain going first and most eagerly—those who had supported Egwene started to fidget. Darlin stepped up and took the pen. He hesitated for a moment, then signed.</p>
<p class="tx">Gregorin followed. Then the Borderlanders, each in turn, followed by the King of Arad Doman. Even Roedran, who still seemed to find this entire thing a fiasco, signed. Perrin found that curious.</p>
<p class="tx">“He blusters a lot,” Perrin said to Faile, “but he knows this is good for his kingdom.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes,” she said. “He’s been acting a buffoon partially to throw everyone off, make them dismiss him. The document outlines current borders of nations to remain as they are,” Faile said. “That’s a huge boon to someone trying to stabilize his rule. But…”</p>
<p class="tx">“But?”</p>
<p class="tx">“The Seanchan?” Faile said softly. “If Rand persuades them, does that allow them to keep the countries they have now? The women who are <span class="epub-i1">damane</span>? Are they allowed to slap one of those collars on any woman who passes their border?”</p>
<p class="tx">The tent stilled; perhaps Faile had spoken more loudly than she’d intended. Perrin sometimes had trouble remembering what ordinary people could and couldn’t hear.</p>
<p class="tx">“I will deal with the Seanchan,” Rand said. He stood over the table, watching as each ruler looked over the document, spoke with the counselors they’d brought, then signed.</p>
<p class="tx">“How?” Darlin asked. “They do <span class="epub-i1">not</span> wish to make peace with you, Lord Dragon. I do think they’ll make this document meaningless.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Once we are done here,” Rand said softly, “I will go to them. They will sign.”</p>
<p class="tx">“And if they do not?” Gregorin demanded.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand rested his hand on the table, fingers spread. “I may have to destroy them. Or at least their ability to make war in the near future.”</p>
<p class="tx">The pavilion grew still.</p>
<p class="tx">“Could you <span class="epub-i1">do</span> that?” Darlin asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m not certain,” Rand admitted. “If I can, it may leave me weakened in a time when I need all of my strength. Light, it may be my only choice. A terrible choice, when I left them last time … We <span class="epub-i1">cannot</span> have them striking at our backs while we fight the Shadow.” He shook his head, and Min stepped up to take his arm. “I will find a way to deal with them. Somehow, I’ll find a way.”</p>
<p class="tx">The signing progressed. Some did it with great flourish, others in more casual fashion. Rand had Perrin, Gawyn, Faile and Gareth Bryne sign as well. He seemed to want anyone here who might rise to a position of leadership to have their names on the document.</p>
<p class="tx">Finally, only Elayne remained. Rand held out the quill to her.</p>
<p class="tx">“This is a difficult thing you ask of me, Rand,” Elayne said, arms folded, golden hair gleaming in the light of his globes. Why <span class="epub-i1">had</span> the sky gone dim outside? Rand didn’t seem worried, but Perrin feared that the clouds had consumed the sky. A dangerous sign, if they now held sway where Rand had once kept them back.</p>
<p class="tx">“I know it is difficult,” Rand said. “Perhaps if I gave you something in return…”</p>
<p class="tx">“What?”</p>
<p class="tx">“The war,” Rand said. He turned to the rulers. “You wanted one of you to lead the Last Battle. Will you accept Andor, and its queen, in this role?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Too young,” Darlin said. “Too new. No offense, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p class="tx">Alsalam snorted. “You’re one to talk, Darlin. Half the monarchs present have held their thrones for a year or less!”</p>
<p class="tx">“What of the Borderlanders?” Alliandre asked. “They’ve fought against the Blight all of their lives.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We are overrun,” Paitar said. He shook his head. “One of us cannot coordinate this. Andor is as good a choice as any.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Andor is suffering an invasion of its own,” Darlin noted.</p>
<p class="tx">“You all are, or soon will be,” Rand said. “Elayne Trakand is a leader to her core; she taught me much of what I know about leadership. She has learned tactics from a great captain, and I’m certain she will rely upon all the great captains for advice. Someone <span class="epub-i1">must</span> lead. Will you all accept her in this position?”</p>
<p class="tx">The others reluctantly nodded agreement. Rand turned to Elayne.</p>
<p class="tx">“All right, Rand,” she said. “I’ll do this, and I will sign, but you had <span class="epub-i1">better</span> find a way to deal with the Seanchan. I want to see their ruler’s name on this document. None of us will be safe until it’s there.”</p>
<p class="tx">“What of the women held by the Seanchan?” Rhuarc asked. “I will admit, Rand al’Thor, our intention was to declare a blood feud with these invaders the moment more pressing battles were won.”</p>
<p class="tx">“If their ruler signs it,” Rand said, “I will ask about trading for goods to retrieve those channelers they have stolen. I will try to persuade them to release the lands they hold and return to their own country.”</p>
<p class="tx">“What if they refuse?” Egwene asked, shaking her head. “Will you let them sign it without giving on those points? Thousands are enslaved, Rand.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We cannot defeat them,” Aviendha said, speaking softly. Perrin eyed her. She smelled frustrated, but determined. “If we go to war with them, we will fall.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Aviendha is right,” Amys said. “The Aiel will <span class="epub-i1">not</span> fight the Seanchan.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rhuarc, startled, looked back and forth between the two.</p>
<p class="tx">“They have done horrible things,” Rand said, “but so far, the lands they have taken have benefited from strong leadership. If forced to it, I am content to allow them the lands they have, so long as they do not spread further. As for the women … what is done is done. Let us worry about the world itself first, then do what we can for those held captive.”</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne held the document for a moment, perhaps for the drama of it, then bent down and added her name to the bottom with a flourish.</p>
<p class="tx">“It is done,” Moiraine said as Rand picked up the document. “You <span class="epub-i1">will</span> have peace this time, Lord Dragon.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We must survive first,” he said, holding the document with reverence. “I will leave you to make your battle preparations. I need to complete some tasks, Seanchan included, before I travel to Shayol Ghul. I do have a request for you, however. There is a dear friend who needs us…”</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Angry lightning blistered the clouded sky. Despite the shade, sweat lined Lan’s neck, matting his hair underneath his helmet. He’d not worn one in years; much of his time with Moiraine had required them to be nondescript, and helmets were anything but.</p>
<p class="tx">“How … how bad is it?” Andere grimaced, holding his side, and leaning back against a rock.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan looked to the battle. The Shadowspawn were amassing again. The monsters almost seemed to blend and shift together, one enormous dark force of howling, <span class="epub-i1">miasmic</span> hatred as thick as the air—which seemed to hold in the heat and the humidity, like a merchant hoarding fine rugs.</p>
<p class="tx">“It’s bad,” Lan said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Knew it would be,” Andere said, breathing in and out quickly, blood seeping between his fingers. “Nazar?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Gone,” Lan said. The white-haired man had gone down in the same set-to that had nearly taken Andere. Lan’s rescue had not been quick enough. “I saw him gut a Trolloc as it killed him.”</p>
<p class="tx">“May the last embrace of the mother—” Andere spasmed in pain. “May the—”</p>
<p class="tx">“May the last embrace of the mother welcome you home,” Lan said softly.</p>
<p class="tx">“Don’t look at me that way, Lan,” Andere said. “We all knew what this was going to be when we … when we joined you.”</p>
<p class="tx">“That is why I tried to stop you.”</p>
<p class="tx">Andere scowled. “I—”</p>
<p class="tx">“Peace, Andere,” Lan said, rising. “What I wished was selfish. I came to die for Malkier. I have no right to deny that privilege to others.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Lord Mandragoran!” Prince Kaisel rode up, his once-fine armor bloodstained and dented. The Kandori prince still looked too young for this battle, but he’d proven himself to be as coolheaded as any grizzled veteran. “They’re forming up again.”</p>
<p class="tx">Lan walked across the rocky ground to where a groom held Mandarb. The black stallion bore cuts on his flanks from Trolloc weapons. Thank the Light, they were superficial. Lan rested a hand on the horse’s neck as Mandarb snorted. Nearby, his standard-bearer, a bald man named Jophil, raised the flag of Malkier, the Golden Crane. This was his fifth standard-bearer since yesterday.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan’s forces had seized the Gap with their initial charge, shoving the Shadowspawn back before they were able to emerge into the valley. That was more than Lan had expected. The Gap was a long, narrow piece of rocky ground nestled between craggy rises and peaks.</p>
<p class="tx">Holding this position required nothing clever. You stood, you died and you killed—as long as you could.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan commanded a cavalry. It wasn’t ideal for this kind of work—cavalries did best where they could spread out and had room to charge—but the passage through Tarwin’s Gap was narrow enough that only a small number of Trollocs could come through at once. That gave Lan a chance. At least it was more difficult for the Trollocs to take advantage of their superior numbers. They would have to pay a butcher’s bill for every yard they gained.</p>
<p class="tx">Trolloc carcasses had formed an almost furlike blanket leading through the canyon. Each time the creatures tried to push through the gorge, Lan’s men had resisted them with lances and polearms, swords and arrows, eventually slaughtering thousands and leaving them heaped for their fellows to climb over. But each clash similarly reduced Lan’s numbers.</p>
<p class="tx">Each assault forced his men to withdraw a little farther. Toward the mouth of the Gap. They were less than a hundred feet from it now.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan felt the fatigue pressing deep into his bones.</p>
<p class="tx">“Our forces?” Lan asked Prince Kaisel.</p>
<p class="tx">“Maybe six thousand still able to ride, Dai Shan.”</p>
<p class="tx">Less than half of what they’d started with a day before. “Tell them to mount up.”</p>
<p class="tx">Kaisel looked shocked. “We’re going to retreat?”</p>
<p class="tx">Lan turned to the lad.</p>
<p class="tx">Kaisel paled. Lan had been told that his gaze could unnerve any man; Moiraine had liked to joke that he could outstare rocks and had the patience of an oak. Well, he didn’t feel as sure of himself as people thought, but this boy should have known better than to ask if they were retreating.</p>
<p class="tx">“Of course,” Lan said, “and then we’re going to attack.”</p>
<p class="tx">“<span class="epub-i1">Attack?</span>” Kaisel said. “We are on the defensive!”</p>
<p class="tx">“They’ll sweep us out,” Lan said, pulling himself into Mandarb’s saddle. “We’re exhausted, worn out and nearly broken. If we stand here and let them come at us again, we’ll fall without a whimper.”</p>
<p class="tx">Lan knew an ending when he saw one.</p>
<p class="tx">“Pass these orders,” Lan said to Prince Kaisel. “We will slowly pull out of the pass. You have the rest of the troops assemble on the plain, mounted and ready to attack the Shadowspawn as they come out of the Gap. A charge will do great damage; they won’t know what hit them.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Won’t we be surrounded and overrun if we leave the pass?” Kaisel asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“This is the best we can do with the resources we have.”</p>
<p class="tx">“And then?”</p>
<p class="tx">“And then they eventually break through, slice our force into pieces and overrun us.”</p>
<p class="tx">Kaisel sat for a moment, then nodded. Again, Lan was impressed. He’d assumed this boy had come with him to find the glory of battle, to fight at the side of Dai Shan and sweep their enemies away. But no. Kaisel was a Borderlander to the core. He hadn’t come for glory. He’d come because he’d had to. <span class="epub-i1">Good lad.</span></p>
<p class="tx">“Give the order now. The men will be glad to get back on their horses again.” Too many of them had been forced to fight on foot because of the lack of maneuverability in the narrow confines.</p>
<p class="tx">Kaisel gave the orders, and those orders burned through Lan’s men like an autumn fire. Lan saw Andere being helped into his saddle by Bulen.</p>
<p class="tx">“Andere?” Lan said, heeling Mandarb toward him. “You are in no condition to ride. Go join the wounded at the back camp.”</p>
<p class="tx">“So I lie back there and let the Trollocs butcher me after finishing you lot?” Andere leaned forward in the saddle, teetering slightly, and Bulen looked up with concern. Andere waved him off and forced himself upright. “We’ve already moved the mountain, Lan. Let’s budge this feather and be through with it.”</p>
<p class="tx">Lan could offer no argument. He called the retreat to the men ahead of him in the pass. His remaining men bunched around him, slowly backing out toward the plain.</p>
<p class="tx">The Trollocs hooted and yelled in excitement. They knew that once they were free of the walls that restricted their movement, they would win this fight easily.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan and his small force left the narrow confines of the Gap, those on foot running toward their horses tethered near the mouth of the canyon.</p>
<p class="tx">The Trollocs—for once—needed no push from the Myrddraal to charge. Their footfalls were a low rumble on the stony ground.</p>
<p class="tx">Several hundred yards out of the Gap, Lan slowed Mandarb and turned. Andere brought his horse up beside Lan’s with difficulty, and they were joined by the other riders, who formed long lines of cavalry. Bulen cantered up to the other side of Lan.</p>
<p class="tx">The storm of Shadowspawn neared the mouth of the Gap, a charging force of thousands of Trollocs that would soon burst out into the open—and try to consume them.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan’s forces were silently lined up around him. Many were old men, the last remnants of their fallen kingdom. This force that had managed to plug the narrow gap now seemed tiny on the much larger plain.</p>
<p class="tx">“Bulen,” Lan said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes, Lord Mandragoran?”</p>
<p class="tx">“You claim to have failed me, years ago.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes, my Lord. It—”</p>
<p class="tx">“Any failing on your part is forgotten,” Lan said, eyes forward. “I am proud to have given you your <span class="epub-i1">hadori</span>.”</p>
<p class="tx">Kaisel rode up, nodding to Lan. “We are ready, Dai Shan.”</p>
<p class="tx">“This is for the best,” Andere said, grimacing, still holding to his wound, barely able to remain in the saddle.</p>
<p class="tx">“It is what must be,” Lan said. Not an argument. Not exactly.</p>
<p class="tx">“No,” Andere said. “It is more than that, Lan. Malkier is like a tree that lost its roots to whiteworms, the branches withering slowly. I’d rather be burned away in a flash.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’d rather charge,” Bulen said, voice growing firm. “I’d rather charge now than let them overrun us. Let us die on the attack, with swords pointed home.”</p>
<p class="tx">Lan nodded, turning and raising his sword high above his head. He gave no speeches. He had given those already. The men knew what this was. One more charge, while they still had some strength, would mean something. Fewer Shadowspawn to flood into civilized lands. Fewer Trollocs to kill those who could not fight back.</p>
<p class="tx">The enemy seemed endless. A slavering, rampaging horde without battle line or discipline. Anger, destruction incarnate. Thousands upon thousands of them. They came forward like floodwaters suddenly released, surging out of the canyon.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan’s little force was but a pebble before them.</p>
<p class="tx">The men silently raised their swords to him, a final salute.</p>
<p class="tx">“Now!” Lan yelled. <span class="epub-i1">Now as they begin to spread out. It will do the most damage.</span> Lan kicked Mandarb forward, leading the way.</p>
<p class="tx">Andere galloped beside Lan, clinging to his pommel with both hands. He didn’t try to raise a weapon; he’d have fallen from his saddle if he had.</p>
<p class="tx">Nynaeve was too far away for Lan to feel much of her through the bond, but sometimes very powerful emotions could stand out despite the distance. He tried to project confidence in case it reached her. Pride in his men. Love for her. He wished deeply for those to be the last things she remembered of him.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">My arm will be the sword</span> … </p>
<p class="tx">Hooves clattered on the ground. The Trollocs ahead hooted in delight, realizing that their prey had transformed a retreat into a charge of men rushing right into their grasp.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">My breast itself a shield</span> … </p>
<p class="tx">Lan could hear a voice, his father’s voice, speaking these words. That was foolish, of course. Lan had been a baby when Malkier had fallen.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">To defend the Seven Towers</span> … </p>
<p class="tx">He had never seen the Seven Towers stand against the Blight. He’d only heard stories.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">To hold back the darkness</span> … </p>
<p class="tx">The horses’ hooves were becoming a thunder. So loud, louder than he’d have thought possible. He held himself straight, sword out.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">I will stand when all others fall.</span></p>
<p class="tx">The oncoming Trollocs leveled spears as the distance between the two opposing forces narrowed.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Al Chalidholara Malkier</span>. For my sweet land Malkier.</p>
<p class="tx">It was the oath a Malkieri soldier took during their first posting to the Border. Lan had never spoken it.</p>
<p class="tx">He did so now in his heart.</p>
<p class="tx">“<span class="epub-i1">Al Chalidholara Malkier!</span>” Lan screamed. “Lances, set!” Light, but those hoofbeats were loud! Could six thousand make so much noise? He turned to look at those behind him.</p>
<p class="tx">At least ten thousand rode there.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">What?</span></p>
<p class="tx">He pressed Mandarb forward through his surprise.</p>
<p class="tx">“Forward the Golden Crane!”</p>
<p class="tx">Voices, shouts, screams of power and joy.</p>
<p class="tx">The air ahead to the left <span class="epub-i1">split</span> with a sudden vertical slash. A gateway three dozen paces wide—as large as Lan had ever seen—opened as if into the sun itself. From the other side, the brightness spilled out, <span class="epub-i1">exploded</span> out. Charging men in full armor burst from the gateway, falling into place at Lan’s flank. They flew the flag of Arafel.</p>
<p class="tx">More gateways. Three, then four, then a dozen. Each broke the field in coordination, charging horsemen bursting forth with lances leveled, flying the flags of Saldaea, Shienar, Kandor. In seconds, his charge of six thousand had become a hundred thousand.</p>
<p class="tx">Trollocs in the front lines screamed, and some of them stopped running. Some held steady, spears angled to impale oncoming horses. Bunching up behind them—not being able to see clearly what was happening in front—other enraged hordes pushed eagerly forward, waving large swords with scythelike blades and double-bitted battle-axes.</p>
<p class="tx">Those Trollocs at the front, holding spears, exploded.</p>
<p class="tx">From somewhere behind Lan, Asha’man began to send weaves to rip the earth, completely destroying the front ranks of Trollocs. As the carcasses collapsed to the ground, the middle ranks found themselves completely exposed, facing a storm of hooves, swords and lances.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan hit, swinging, crashing Mandarb through the snarling Trollocs. Andere was laughing.</p>
<p class="tx">“Back, you fool!” Lan yelled to him as he lashed out at the nearby Trollocs. “Direct the Asha’man to our wounded; have them protect the camp!”</p>
<p class="tx">“I want to see you smile, Lan!” Andere shouted, clinging to his horse’s saddle. “Show more emotion than a stone, for once! Surely this deserves it!”</p>
<p class="tx">Lan looked at the battle he’d never thought to win, seeing a last stand instead become a promising fight, and couldn’t help himself. He didn’t just smile, he laughed.</p>
<p class="tx">Andere obeyed his order, riding off to seek Healing and organize the back lines.</p>
<p class="tx">“Jophil,” Lan called. “Raise my banner high! Malkier lives on this day!”</p>
