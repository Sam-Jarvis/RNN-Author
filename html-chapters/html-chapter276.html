<div class="p"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">A Note on Dates in This Glossary.</span> The Toman Calendar (devised by Toma dur Ahmid) was adopted approximately two centuries after the death of the last male Aes Sedai, recording years After the Breaking of the World (AB). So many records were destroyed in the Trolloc Wars that at their end there was argument about the exact year under the old system. A new calendar, proposed by Tiam of Gazar, celebrated freedom from the Trolloc threat and recorded each year as a Free Year (FY). The Gazaran Calendar gained wide acceptance within twenty years after the Wars’ end. Artur Hawkwing attempted to establish a new calendar based on the founding of his empire (FF, From the Founding), but only historians now refer to it. After the death and destruction of the War of the Hundred Years, a third calendar was devised by Uren din Jubai Soaring Gull, a scholar of the Sea Folk, and promulgated by the Panarch Farede of Tarabon. The Farede Calendar, dating from the arbitrarily decided end of the War of the Hundred Years and recording years of the New Era (NE), is currently in use.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent-inverse"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">Accepted, the:</span> Young women in training to be Aes Sedai who have reached a certain level of power and passed certain tests. It normally takes five to ten years to be raised from novice to the Accepted. Accepted are somewhat less confined by rules than novices, and are allowed to choose their
own areas of study, within limits. Accepted wear a Great Serpent ring, but only on the third finger of the left hand. When an Accepted is raised Aes Sedai, she chooses her Ajah, gains the right to wear the shawl, and may wear the ring on any finger or not at all if circumstances warrant. <span class="calibre18">See also</span> Aes Sedai.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent-inverse"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">a’dam</span> (AYE-dam)<span class="calibre2">:</span> A Seanchan device for controlling a woman who can channel, consisting of a collar and bracelet linked by a leash, all of silvery metal. It has no effect on a woman who cannot channel. <span class="calibre18">See also damane</span>; Seanchan; <span class="calibre18">sul’dam</span>.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent-inverse"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">Adelin</span> (AD-ehl-ihn): A woman of the Jindo sept of the Taardad Aiel. A Maiden of the Spear who came to the Stone of Tear.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent-inverse"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">Aes Sedai</span> (EYEZ seh-DEYE): Wielders of the One Power. Since the Time of Madness, all surviving Aes Sedai are women. Widely distrusted and feared, even hated. Blamed by many for the Breaking of the World, and thought to meddle in the affairs of nations. At the same time, few rulers are without an Aes Sedai advisor, even in lands where such a connection must be kept secret. After some years of channeling the One Power, Aes Sedai take on an ageless quality, so that one old enough to be a grandmother may show no signs of age except perhaps a few gray hairs. <span class="calibre18">See also</span> Ajah; Amyrlin Seat; Time of Madness.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent-inverse"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">Age of Legends:</span> Age ended by the War of the Shadow and the Breaking of the World. A time when Aes Sedai performed wonders now only dreamed of. <span class="calibre18">See also</span> Wheel of Time, the; Breaking of the World, the; War of the Shadow.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent-inverse"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">Aiel</span> (eye-EEL): The people of the Aiel Waste. Fierce and hardy. Veil their faces before they kill, giving rise to the saying “acting like a black-veiled Aiel” to describe someone being violent. Deadly warriors with weapons or with bare hands, they will not touch a sword. Their pipers play them into battle with the music of dances. Aiel call battle “the dance,” and “the dance of spears.” <span class="calibre18">See also</span> Aiel warrior societies; Aiel Waste.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent-inverse"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">Aiel War, the:</span> (976–78 NE) When King Laman (LAY-mahn) of Cairhien cut down <span class="calibre18">Avendoraldera</span>, four clans of the Aiel crossed the Spine of the World. They looted and burned the capital city of Cairhien as well as many other cities and towns, and the conflict extended into Andor and Tear. By the conventional view, the Aiel were finally defeated at the Battle of the Shining Walls, before Tar Valon; in fact, Laman was killed in that battle, and having done what they came for, the Aiel recrossed the Spine. <span class="calibre18">See also Avendoraldera</span>; Cairhien.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent-inverse"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">Aiel warrior societies:</span> Aiel warriors are all members of one of the warrior societies, such as the Stone Dogs (<span class="calibre18">Shae’en M’taal</span>), the Red Shields (<span class="calibre18">Aethan Dor</span>), the Water Seekers (<span class="calibre18">Duahde Mahdi’in</span>) or the Maidens of the Spear (<span class="calibre18">Far Dareis Mai</span>). Each has its own customs, and sometimes specific duties. For example, Red Shields act as police. Stone Dogs are often used as rear guards during retreats, while Maidens are often scouts. Aiel clans frequently raid and battle, but members of the same society will not fight each other even if their clans do so. Thus there are always lines of contact between the clans even during open warfare. <span class="calibre18">See also</span> Aiel; Aiel Waste; <span class="calibre18">Far Dareis Mai</span>.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent-inverse"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">Aiel Waste:</span> Harsh, rugged and all-but-waterless land east of the Spine of the World. Called the Three-fold Land by the Aiel. Few outsiders enter; the Aiel consider themselves at war with all other peoples and do not welcome strangers. Only peddlers, gleemen, and the Tuatha’an are allowed safe entry, although Aiel avoid all contact with the Tuatha’an, whom they call “the Lost Ones.” No maps of the Waste itself are known to exist.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent-inverse"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">Ajah</span> (AH-jah): Societies among the Aes Sedai, seven in number and designated by colors: Blue, Red, White, Green, Brown, Yellow and Gray. All Aes Sedai except the Amyrlin Seat belong to one. Each follows a specific philosophy of the use of the One Power and the purposes of the Aes Sedai. The Red Ajah bends its energies to finding men who can channel, and to gentling them. The Brown forsakes involvement with the mundane world and dedicates itself to seeking knowledge, while the White, largely eschewing both the world and the value of worldly knowledge, devotes itself to questions of philosophy and truth. The Green Ajah (called the Battle Ajah during the Trolloc Wars) holds itself ready for Tarmon Gai’don, the Yellow concentrates on the study of Healing, and Blue sisters involve themselves with causes and justice. The Gray are mediators, seeking harmony and consensus. Rumors of a Black Ajah, dedicated to serving the Dark One, are officially denied.</span></div>

Among those who could channel, the most powerful were Raolin Darksbane (335–36 AB),
Yurian Stonebow (circa 1300–1308 AB), Davian (FY 351), Guaire Amalasan (FY 939–43), and Logain (997 NE). <span class="calibre18">See also</span> Dragon Reborn; War of the Second Dragon.</span></div>

(2) To make no weapon with which one man may kill another.

This inborn ability usually manifests itself in late adolescence or early adulthood. If control is not taught, or self-learned (extremely difficult, with a success rate of only one in four), death is certain. Since the Time of Madness, no man has been able to channel the Power without eventually going completely, horribly mad, and then, even if he has learned some control, dying from a wasting sickness that causes the sufferer to rot alive, a sickness caused, as is the madness, by the Dark One’s taint on <span class="calibre18">saidin</span>. <span class="calibre18">See also</span> Aes Sedai; channel; Five Powers, the; Time of Madness; True Source.</span></div>

Its location is a secret closely guarded by the Aiel.

<div class="p-indent-inverse"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">sa’sara</span> (sah-SAHR-rah): An indecent Saldaean dance, outlawed by a number of Saldaean queens, but to no avail. Saldaean history records three wars, two rebellions, and countless unions and/or feuds between noble houses, as well as innumerable duels, sparked by women dancing the sa’sara. One rebellion was supposedly quelled when a defeated queen danced it for the victorious general; he married her and restored her throne. This tale is not found in any official history and has been denied by every queen of Saldaea.</span></div>

Inhabitants of islands in the Aryth (AH-rihth) Ocean and the Sea of Storms, they spend little time ashore, living most of their lives on their ships. Most seaborne trade is carried by Sea Folk ships.</span></div>

They believe that any woman who can channel must be controlled for the safety of everyone else, and any man who can channel must be killed for the same reason. (2) The land from which the Seanchan come.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent-inverse"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">Seekers for Truth:</span> A police/spy organization of the Seanchan Imperial Throne. Although most are property of the Imperial family, they have wide powers. Even one of the Blood (a Seanchan noble) can be arrested for failure to answer any question put by a Seeker, or for failure to cooperate fully with a Seeker, this last defined by the Seekers themselves, subject only to review by the Empress.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent-inverse"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18"><span class="calibre2">stedding</span></span> (STEHD-ding): An Ogier (OH-geer) homeland. Many <span class="calibre18">stedding</span> have been abandoned since the Breaking of the World. They are shielded in some way, no longer understood, so that within them no Aes Sedai
can channel the One Power, nor even sense the True Source. Attempts to wield the One Power from outside a <span class="calibre18">stedding</span> have no effect inside the <span class="calibre18">stedding</span> boundary. No Trolloc will enter a <span class="calibre18">stedding</span> unless driven, and even Myrddraal will do so only at the greatest need and with the greatest reluctance. Even Darkfriends, if truly dedicated, feel uncomfortable within a <span class="calibre18">stedding</span>.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent-inverse"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">stilling:</span> The act, performed by Aes Sedai, of shutting off a woman who can channel from the One Power. A woman who has been stilled can sense the True Source, but cannot touch it. So seldom has it been done that novices are required to learn the names and crimes of all women who have suffered it. Officially, stilling is the result of trial and sentence for a crime. When it happens accidentally, it is called being burned out. In practice, the term stilling is often used for both.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent-inverse"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">Stone of Tear:</span> A great fortress in the city of Tear, said to have been made by use of the One Power soon after the Breaking of the World. Attacked and besieged unsuccessfully countless times, it fell in a single night to the Dragon Reborn and a few hundred Aiel, thus fulfilling two parts of the Prophecies of the Dragon. The Stone contains a collection of <span class="calibre18">an’greal</span> and <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal</span> rivaling that of the White Tower, a collection gathered, some say, in an attempt to diminish the glare of possessing <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>.</span></div>

Young women in Seanchan are tested for this ability at the same time as the testing for <span class="calibre18">damane</span> and to the same age. A fairly honored position among the Seanchan. Many more <span class="calibre18">sul’dam</span> are found than <span class="calibre18">damane</span>. <span class="calibre18">See also a’dam</span>; <span class="calibre18">damane</span>; Seanchan.</span></div>

Some, such as Traveling, the ability to shift from one place to another without crossing the intervening space, have been lost. Others, such as Foretelling (the ability to foretell future events, but in a general way), are now found rarely. Another Talent long thought lost is Dreaming, which involves, among other things, interpreting the Dreamer’s dreams to foretell future events in more specific
fashion than Foretelling does. Some Dreamers had the ability to enter <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span>, the World of Dreams, and (it is said) even other people’s dreams. The last known Dreamer was Corianin Nedeal (coh-ree-AHN-IHN neh-dee-AHL), who died in 526 NE, but there is now another, known to but a few.</span></div>

Some <span class="calibre18">ter’angreal</span> are used by Aes Sedai, but the original purposes of many are unknown. Some require channeling, while others may be used by anyone.

Huge of stature, they are a twisted blend of animal and human stock. Divided into tribe-like bands, among them the Dha’vol, the Ko’bal, and the Dhai’mon. Vicious by nature, they kill for the pure pleasure of killing. Deceitful in the extreme, they cannot be trusted unless coerced by fear.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent-inverse"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">Trolloc Wars:</span> A series of wars, beginning about 1000 AB and lasting more than three hundred years, during which Trolloc armies ravaged the world.

<div class="p-indent-inverse"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">Warder:</span> A warrior bonded to an Aes Sedai. The bonding is a thing of the One Power: by it he gains such gifts as quick healing, the ability to go long periods without food, water, or rest, and the ability to sense the taint of the Dark One at a distance. So long as a Warder lives, the Aes Sedai to whom he is bonded knows he is alive however far away he is, and when he dies she will know the moment and manner of his death. While most Ajahs believe an Aes Sedai may have one Warder bonded
to her at a time, the Red Ajah refuses to bond any Warders at all, while the Green Ajah believe an Aes Sedai may bond as many as she wishes. Ethically the Warder must accede to the bonding voluntarily, but it has been known to be done against the Warder’s will. What the Aes Sedai gain from the bonding is a closely held secret. <span class="calibre18">See also</span> Aes Sedai.</span></div>

The War of the Hundred Years depopulated large parts of the lands between the Aryth Ocean and the Aiel Waste, from the Sea of Storms to the Great Blight. So great was the destruction that only fragmentary records of the time remain. The empire of Artur Hawkwing was pulled apart, and the nations of the present day were formed. <span class="calibre18">See also</span> Hawkwing, Artur.</span></div>

Such women usually build barriers against knowing what it is they are doing, but if these can be broken down, wilders are among the most powerful of channelers. The term is often used in derogatory fashion.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent-inverse"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">Wisdom:</span> In villages, a woman chosen by the Women’s Circle for her knowledge of such things as healing and foretelling the weather, as well as common good sense. Generally considered the equal of the Mayor, and in some villages his superior. She is chosen for life, and it is very rare for a Wisdom to be removed from office before her death. Depending on the land, she may instead have another title, such as Guide, Healer, Wise Woman, or Seeker.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent-inverse"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">Wise One:</span> Among the Aiel, Wise Ones are women chosen by other Wise Ones and trained in healing, herbs and other things, much like Wisdoms. Usually there is a single Wise One to each clan or sept hold. Some Wise Ones are said to have wondrous healing abilities, and to do things that seem miraculous. They have great authority and responsibility, as well as great influence with sept and clan chiefs, though these men often accuse them of meddling.</span></div></div>
