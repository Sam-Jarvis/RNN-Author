<div class="subtitle-chapter"><span class="calibre2"><span class="calibre18">Reflection</span></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">D</span>espite the hour, a good many people were hurrying through the Stone’s wide corridors, a steady trickle of men and women in the black and gold of Stone servants or the livery of one High Lord or another. Now and again a Defender or two appeared, bareheaded and unarmed, some with their coats undone. The servants bowed or curtsied to Perrin and Faile if they came close, then hurried on with hardly a pause. Most of the soldiers gave a start on seeing them. Some bowed stiffly, hand to heart, but one and all quickened their steps as if eager to be away.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Only one lamp in three or four was lit. In the dim stretches between their tall stands, shadows blurred the hanging tapestries and obscured the occasional chest against the wall. For any eyes but Perrin’s, they did. His eyes glowed like burnished gold in those murky lengths of hall. He walked quickly from lamp to lamp and kept his gaze down unless he was in full light. Most people in the Stone knew about his strangely colored eyes, one way or another. None of them mentioned it, of course. Even Faile seemed to assume the color was part of his association with an Aes Sedai, something that simply was, to be accepted but never explained. Even so, a prickling always ran across his back whenever he realized that a stranger had seen his eyes shining in the dark. When they held their tongues, the silence only emphasized his apartness.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I wish they wouldn’t look at me like that,” he muttered as a grizzled
Defender twice his age came close to running once he had passed. “As though they are afraid of me. They haven’t before; not this way. Why aren’t all these people in bed?” A woman carrying a mop and a bucket bobbed a curtsy and scurried by with her head down.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Her arm twined through his, Faile glanced at him. “I would say the guards are not supposed to be in this part of the Stone unless they are on duty. A good time to cuddle a maid on a lord’s chair, and maybe pretend they are the lord and lady, while lord and lady are asleep. They are probably worried that you might report them. And servants do most of their work at night. Who would want them underfoot, sweeping and dusting and polishing, in daylight?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin nodded doubtfully. He supposed she would know about such things from her father’s house. A successful merchant likely had servants, and guards for his wagons. At least these folk were not out of their beds because what had happened to him had happened to them, too. If that were the case, they would be out of the Stone altogether, and likely still running. But why had he been a target, singled out, as it seemed? He was not looking forward to confronting Rand, but he had to know. Faile had to stretch her stride to keep up with him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">For all its splendor, all the gold and fine carving and inlays, the interior of the Stone had been designed for war as much as its exterior had been. Murderholes dotted the ceiling wherever corridors crossed. Never-used arrowslits peeked into the halls at places where they might cover an entire hallway. He and Faile climbed narrow, curving staircase after narrow, curving staircase, all built into the walls or else enclosed, with more arrowslits looking down on the corridor below. None of this design had hampered the Aiel, of course, the first enemy ever to get beyond the outer wall.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">As they trotted up one of the winding stairs—Perrin did not realize they were trotting, though he would have been moving faster if not for Faile on his arm—he caught a whiff of old sweat and a hint of sickly-sweet perfume, but they registered only in the back of his brain. He was caught up in what he was going to say to Rand. <span class="calibre18">Why did you try to kill me? Are you going mad already?</span> There was no easy way to ask, and he did not expect easy answers.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Stepping out into a shadowed corridor nearly at the top of the Stone, he found himself staring at the backs of a High Lord and two of the nobleman’s personal guards. Only the Defenders were allowed to wear armor inside the Stone, but these three had swords at their hips. That was not unusual, of course, but their presence here, on this floor, in the shadows,
staring intently at the bright light at the far end of the hall, that was not usual at all. That light came from the anteroom in front of the chambers Rand had been given. Or taken. Or maybe been pushed into by Moiraine.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin and Faile had made no effort to be quiet in climbing the stairs, but the three men were so intent in their watching that none of them noticed the new arrivals at first. Then one of the blue-coated bodyguards twisted his head as if working a cramp in his neck; his mouth dropped open when he saw them. Biting off an oath, the fellow whirled to face Perrin, baring a good hand of his swordblade. The other was only a heartbeat slower. Both stood tensed, ready, but their eyes shifted uneasily, sliding off Perrin’s. They gave off a sour smell of fear. So did the High Lord, though he had his fear tightly reined.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The High Lord Torean, white streaking his dark, pointed beard, moved languidly, as if at a ball. Pulling a too sweetly scented handkerchief from his sleeve, he dabbed at a knobby nose that appeared not at all large when compared with his ears. A fine silk coat with red satin cuffs only exaggerated the plainness of his face. He eyed Perrin’s shirtsleeves and dabbed his nose again before inclining his head slightly. “The Light illumine you,” he said politely. His glance touched Perrin’s yellow stare and flinched away, though his expression did not change. “You are well, I trust?” Perhaps too politely.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin did not really care for the man’s tone, but the way Torean looked Faile up and down, with a sort of casual interest, clenched his fists. He managed to keep his voice level, though. “The Light illumine you, High Lord Torean. I am glad to see you helping keep watch over the Lord Dragon. Some men in your place might resent him being here.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Torean’s thin eyebrows twitched. “Prophecy has been fulfilled, and Tear has fulfilled its place in that prophecy. Perhaps the Dragon Reborn will lead Tear to a still greater destiny. What man could resent that? But it is late. A good night to you.” He eyed Faile again, pursing his lips, and walked off down the hall just a bit too briskly, away from the anteroom’s lights. His bodyguards heeled him like well-trained dogs.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“There was no need for you to be uncivil,” Faile said in a tight voice when the High Lord was out of hearing. “You sounded as if your tongue were frozen iron. If you do intend to remain here, you had better learn to get on with the lords.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He was looking at you as if he wanted to dandle you on his knee. And I do not mean like a father.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She sniffed dismissively. “He is not the first man ever to look at me. If
he found the nerve to try more, I could put him in his place with a frown and a glance. I do not need you to speak for me, Perrin Aybara.” Still, she did not sound entirely displeased.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Scratching his beard, he peered after Torean, watching the High Lord and his guards vanish around a distant corner. He wondered how the Tairen lords managed without sweating to death. “Did you notice, Faile? His heel-hounds did not take their hands off their swords until he was ten paces clear of us.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She frowned at him, then down the hall after the three, and nodded slowly. “You’re right. But I do not understand. They do not bow and scrape the way they do for <span class="calibre18">him</span>, but everyone walks as warily around you and Mat as they do around the Aes Sedai.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Maybe being a friend of the Dragon Reborn isn’t as much protection as it used to be.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She did not suggest leaving again, not in words, but her eyes were full of it. He was more successful in ignoring the unspoken suggestion than he had been with the spoken.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Before they reached the end of the hallway, Berelain came hurrying out of the bright lights of the anteroom, clutching a thin white robe tightly around her with both arms. If the First of Mayene had been walking any faster, she would have been running.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">To show Faile he could be as civil as she could possibly wish, Perrin swept a bow that he wagered even Mat could not have bettered. By contrast, Faile’s curtsy was the barest nod of her head, the merest bending of a knee. He hardly noticed. As Berelain rushed past them without a glance, the smell of fear, rank and raw as a festering wound, made his nostrils twitch. Beside this, Torean’s fear was nothing. This was mad panic tied with a frayed rope. He straightened slowly, staring after her.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Filling your eyes?” Faile asked softly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Intent on Berelain, wondering what had driven her so near the brink, he spoke without thinking. “She smelled of—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Far down the corridor, Torean suddenly stepped out of a side hallway to seize Berelain’s arm. He was talking a torrent, but Perrin could not make out more than a handful of scattered words, something about her overstepping herself in her pride, and something else that seemed to be Torean offering her his protection. Her reply was short, sharp, and even more inaudible, delivered with lifted chin. Pulling herself free roughly, the First of Mayene walked away, back straight and seemingly more in command of
herself. On the point of following, Torean saw Perrin watching. Dabbing at his nose with his handkerchief, the High Lord vanished back into the crossing corridor.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I do not care if she smelled of the Essence of Dawn,” Faile said darkly. “That one is not interested in hunting a bear, however fine his hide would look stretched on a wall. She hunts the sun.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He frowned at her. “The sun? A bear? What are you talking about?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You go on by yourself. I think I will go to my bed after all.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“If that’s what you want,” he said slowly, “but I thought you were as eager to find out what happened as I am.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I think not. I’ll not pretend I am eager to meet the . . . Rand . . . not after avoiding it until now. And now I am especially not eager. No doubt the two of you will have a fine talk without me. Especially if there’s wine.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You don’t make any sense,” he muttered, scrubbing a hand through his hair. “If you want to go to bed, then fine, but I wish you would say something I understand.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">For a long moment she studied his face, then suddenly bit her lip. He thought she was trying not to laugh. “Oh, Perrin, sometimes I believe it is your innocence I enjoy most of all.” Sure enough, traces of laughter silvered her voice. “You go on to . . . to your friend and tell me of it in the morning. As much as you want to.” She pulled his head down to brush his lips with a kiss and, as quick as the kiss, ran back down the hallway.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Shaking his head, he watched until she turned in to the stairs with no sign of Torean. Sometimes it was as if she spoke another language. He headed toward the lights.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The anteroom was a round chamber fifty paces or more across. A hundred gilded lamps hung on golden chains from its high ceiling. Polished redstone columns made an inner ring, and the floor appeared to be one huge slab of black marble, streaked with gold. It had been the anteroom of the king’s chambers, in the days when Tear had kings, before Artur Hawkwing put everything from the Spine of the World to the Aryth Ocean under one king. The Tairen kings had not returned when Hawkwing’s empire collapsed, and for a thousand years the only inhabitants of these apartments had been mice tracking through dust. No High Lord had ever had enough power to dare claim them for his own.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">A ring of fifty Defenders stood rigidly in the middle of the room, breastplates and rimmed helmets gleaming, spears all slanted at exactly the same angle. Facing every direction as they did, they were supposed to
keep all intruders from the current lord of the Stone. Their commander, a captain distinguished by two short white plumes on his helmet, held himself only a trifle less stiffly. He posed with one hand on his sword hilt and the other on his hip, self-important with his duty. They all smelled of fear and uncertainty, like men who lived under a crumbling cliff and had almost managed to convince themselves it would never fall. Or at least not tonight. Not in the next hour.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin walked on by them, his bootheels making echoes. The officer started toward him, then hesitated when Perrin did not stop to be challenged. He knew who Perrin was, of course; at least, he knew as much as any Tairen knew. Traveling companion of Aes Sedai, friend of the Lord Dragon. Not a man to be interfered with by a mere officer of the Defenders of the Stone. There was his apparent task of guarding the Lord Dragon’s rest, of course, but though he probably did not admit it even to himself, the officer had to know that he and his brave show of polished armor were simply that. The real guards were those Perrin met when he strode beyond the columns and approached the doors to Rand’s chambers.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">They had been sitting so still behind the columns that they seemed to fade into the stone, though their coats and breeches—in shades of gray and brown, made to hide them in the Waste—stood out here as soon as they moved. Six Maidens of the Spear, Aiel women who had chosen a warrior’s life over the hearth, flowed between him and the doors on soft, laced boots that reached their knees. They were tall for women, the tallest barely a hand shorter than he, sun-darkened, with short-cropped hair, yellow or red or something in between. Two held curved horn bows with arrows nocked, if not drawn. The others carried small hide bucklers and three or four short spears each—short, but with spearheads long enough to stick through a man’s body with inches to spare.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I do not think I can let you go in,” a woman with flame-colored hair said, smiling slightly to take the sting out of the words. Aiel did not go about grinning as much as other folk, or show a great deal of any outward emotion for that matter. “I think he does not want to see anyone tonight.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I am going in, Bain.” Ignoring her spears, he took her by the upper arms. That was when it became impossible to ignore the spears, since she had managed to get a spearpoint hard against the side of his throat. For that matter, a somewhat blonder woman named Chiad suddenly had one of her spears at the other side, as if the two were intended to meet somewhere in the middle of his neck. The other women only watched, confident that Bain and Chiad could handle whatever had to be done. Still, he did his
best. “I don’t have time to argue with you. Not that you listen to people who argue with you, as I remember. I am going in.” As gently as he could, he picked Bain up and set her out of his way.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Chiad’s spear only needed her to breathe on it to draw blood, but after one startled widening of dark blue eyes, Bain abruptly took hers away and grinned. “Would you like to learn a game called Maidens’ Kiss, Perrin? You might play well, I think. At the very least you would learn something.” One of the others laughed aloud. Chiad’s spearpoint left his neck.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He took a deep breath, hoping they would not notice it was his first since the spears touched him. They had not veiled their faces—their <span class="calibre18">shoufa</span> lay coiled around their necks like dark scarves—but he did not know if Aiel had to do so before they killed, only that veiling meant they were ready to.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Another time, perhaps,” he said politely. They were all grinning as if Bain had said something amusing, and his not understanding was part of the humor. Thom was right. A man could go crazy trying to understand women, of any nation and any station in life; that was what Thom said.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">As he reached for a door handle in the shape of a rearing golden lion, Bain added, “On your head be it. He has already chased out what most men would consider better company by far than you.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">Of course</span>, he thought, pulling open the door, <span class="calibre18">Berelain. She was coming from here. Tonight, everything is revolving around—</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The First of Mayene vanished from his thoughts as he got a look into the room. Broken mirrors hung on the walls and broken glass covered the floor, along with shards of shattered porcelain and feathers from the slashed mattress. Open books lay tumbled among overturned chairs and benches. And Rand was sitting at the foot of his bed, slumped against one of the bedposts with eyes closed and hands limp atop <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>, which lay across his knees. He looked as if he had taken a bath in blood.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Get Moiraine!” Perrin snapped at the Aiel women. Was Rand still alive? If he was, he needed Aes Sedai Healing to stay that way. “Tell her to hurry!” He heard a gasp behind him, then soft boots running.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand lifted his head. His face was a smeared mask. “Shut the door.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Moiraine will be here soon, Rand. Rest easy. She will—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Shut the door, Perrin.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Murmuring among themselves, the Aiel women frowned, but moved back. Perrin pulled the door to, cutting off a questioning shout from the white-plumed officer.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Glass crunched under his boots as he crossed the carpet to Rand. Tearing a strip from a wildly sliced linen sheet, he wadded it against the wound
in Rand’s side. Rand’s hands tightened on the transparent sword at the pressure, then relaxed. Blood soaked through almost immediately. Cuts and gashes covered him from the soles of his feet to his head; slivers of glass glittered in many of them. Perrin rolled his shoulders helplessly. He did not know what more to do, other than wait for Moiraine.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What under the Light did you try to do, Rand? You look as though you tried to skin yourself. And you nearly killed me, as well.” For a moment he thought Rand was not going to answer.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Not me,” Rand said finally, in a near whisper. “One of the Forsaken.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin tried to relax muscles he did not remember tensing. The effort was only partly successful. He had mentioned the Forsaken to Faile, not exactly casually, but by and large he had been trying not to think of what the Forsaken might do when they found out where Rand was. If one of them could bring down the Dragon Reborn, he or she would stand high above the others when the Dark One broke free. The Dark One free, and the Last Battle lost before it was fought.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Are you sure?” he said, just as quietly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It had to be, Perrin. It had to be.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“If one of them came after me as well as you . . . ? Where’s Mat, Rand? If he was alive, and went through what I did, he’d be thinking what I did. That it was you. He’d be here by now to bless you out.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Or on a horse and halfway to the city gates.” Rand struggled to sit erect. Drying blood smears cracked, and fresh trickles started on his chest and shoulders. “If he is dead, Perrin, you had best get as far from me as you can. I think you and Loial are right about that.” He paused, studying Perrin. “You and Mat must wish I had never been born. Or at least that you’d never seen me.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">There was no point in going to check; if anything had happened to Mat, it was over and done now. And he had a feeling that his makeshift bandage pressed against Rand’s side might be what would keep him alive long enough for Moiraine to get there. “You don’t seem to care if he <span class="calibre18">has</span> gone off. Burn me, he’s important, too. What are you going to do if he’s gone? Or dead, the Light send it not so.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What they least expect.” Rand’s eyes looked like morning mist covering the dawn, blue-gray with a feverish glow seeping through. His voice had a knife edge. “That is what I have to do in any case. What <span class="calibre18">everyone</span> least expects.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin took a slow breath. Rand had a right to taut nerves. It was not a
sign of incipient madness. He had to stop watching for signs of madness. Those signs would come soon enough, and watching would do nothing but keep his stomach tied in knots. “What’s that?” he asked quietly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand closed his eyes. “I only know I have to catch them by surprise. Catch everyone by surprise,” he muttered fiercely.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">One of the doors opened to admit a tall Aielman, his dark red hair touched with gray. Behind him the Tairen officer’s plumes bobbed as he argued with the Maidens; he was still arguing when Bain pushed the door shut.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rhuarc surveyed the room with sharp blue eyes, as if he suspected enemies hiding behind a drape or an overturned chair. The clan chief of the Taardad Aiel had no visible weapon except the heavy-bladed knife at his waist, but he carried authority and confidence like weapons, quietly, yet as surely as if they were sheathed alongside the knife. And his <span class="calibre18">shoufa</span> hung about his shoulders; no one who knew the slightest about Aiel took one for less than dangerous when he wore the means to veil his face.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“That Tairen fool outside sent word to his commander that something had happened in here,” Rhuarc said, “and rumors are already sprouting like corpse moss in a deep cave. Everything from the White Tower trying to kill you to the Last Battle fought here in this room.” Perrin opened his mouth; Rhuarc raised a forestalling hand. “I happened to meet Berelain, looking as if she had been told the day she would die, and she told me the truth of it. And it does look to be the truth, though I doubted her.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I sent for Moiraine,” Perrin said. Rhuarc nodded. Of course, the Maidens would have told him everything they knew.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand gave a painful bark of a laugh. “I told her to keep quiet. It seems the Lord Dragon doesn’t rule Mayene.” He sounded more wryly amused than anything else.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I have daughters older than that young woman,” Rhuarc said. “I do not believe she will tell anyone else. I think she would like to forget everything that happened tonight.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“And I would like to know what happened,” Moiraine said, gliding into the room. Slight and slender as she was, Rhuarc towered over her as much as the man who followed her in—Lan, her Warder—but it was the Aes Sedai who dominated the room. She must have run to come so fast, but she was calm as a frozen lake now. It took a great deal to ruffle Moiraine’s serenity. Her blue silk gown had a high lace neck and sleeves slashed with darker velvet, but the heat and humidity did not appear to touch her.
A small blue stone, suspended on her forehead from a fine golden chain in her dark hair, flashed in the light, emphasizing the absence of the slightest sheen of sweat.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">As always when they met, Lan’s and Rhuarc’s icy blue stares nearly struck sparks. A braided leather cord held Lan’s dark hair, gray-streaked at the temples. His face looked to have been carved from rock, all hard planes and angles, and his sword rode his hip like part of his body. Perrin was not sure which of the two men was more deadly, but he thought a mouse could starve on the difference.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Warder’s eyes swung to Rand. “I thought you were old enough to shave without someone to guide your hand.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rhuarc smiled, a slight smile but the first Perrin had ever seen from him in Lan’s presence. “He is young yet. He will learn.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Lan glanced back at the Aielman, then returned the smile, just as slightly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine gave the two men a brief, withering look. She did not seem to pick her way as she crossed the carpet, but she stepped so lightly, holding her skirts up, that not one shard of glass crunched under her slippers. Her eyes swept around the room; taking in the smallest details, Perrin was sure. For a moment she studied him—he did not meet her gaze; she knew too much about him for comfort—but she bore down on Rand like a silent, silken avalanche, icy and inexorable.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin dropped his hand and moved out of her way. The wadded cloth stayed against Rand’s side, held by congealing blood. From head to foot the blood was beginning to dry in black streaks and smears. The slivers of glass in his skin glittered in the lamplight. Moiraine touched the blood-caked cloth with her fingertips, then took her hand back as though changing her mind about looking underneath. Perrin wondered how the Aes Sedai could look at Rand without wincing, but her smooth face did not change. She smelled faintly of rose-scented soap.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“At least you are alive.” Her voice was musical, a chill, angry music at the moment. “What happened can wait. Try to touch the True Source.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Why?” Rand asked in a wary voice. “I cannot Heal myself, even if I knew how to Heal. No one can. I know that much.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">For the space of a breath Moiraine seemed on the point of an outburst, strange as that would have been, but in another breath she was once again layered in calm so deep that surely nothing could crack it. “Only some of the strength for Healing comes from the Healer. The Power can replace what comes from the Healed. Without it, you will spend tomorrow flat on
your back and perhaps the next day as well. Now, draw on the Power, if you can, but do nothing with it. Simply hold it. Use this, if you must.” She did not have to bend far to touch <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand moved the sword from under her hand. “Simply hold it, you say.” He sounded about to laugh out loud. “Very well.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nothing happened that Perrin could see, not that he expected to. Rand sat there like the survivor of a lost battle, looking at Moiraine. She hardly blinked. Twice she scrubbed her fingers against her palms as if unaware.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">After a time Rand sighed. “I cannot even reach the Void. I can’t seem to concentrate.” A quick grin cracked the blood drying on his face. “I do not understand why.” A thick red thread snaked its way down past his left eye.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Then I will do it as I always have,” Moiraine said, and took Rand’s head in her hands, careless of the blood that ran over her fingers.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand lurched to his feet with a roaring gasp, as if all the breath were being squeezed from his lungs, back arching so his head nearly tore free of her grasp. One arm flung wide, fingers spread and bending back so far it seemed they must break; the other hand clamped down on <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>’s hilt, the muscles of that arm knotting visibly into cramps. He shook like cloth caught in a windstorm. Dark flakes of dried blood fell, and bits of glass tinkled onto the chest and floor, forced out of cuts closing up and knitting themselves together.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin shivered as if that windstorm roared around him. He had seen Healing done before, that and more, greater and worse, but he could never be complacent about seeing the Power used, about knowing it was being used, not even for this. Tales of Aes Sedai, told by merchants’ guards and drivers, had embedded themselves in his mind long years before he met Moiraine. Rhuarc smelled sharply uneasy. Only Lan took it as a matter of course. Lan and Moiraine.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Almost as soon as it began, it was done. Moiraine took her hands away, and Rand slumped, catching the bedpost to hold himself on his feet. It was difficult to say whether he clutched the bedpost or <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> more tenaciously. When Moiraine tried to take the sword to replace it on the ornate stand against the wall, he drew it away from her firmly, even roughly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Her mouth tightened momentarily, but she contented herself with pulling the wad of cloth from his side, using it to scrub away some of the surrounding smears. The old wound was a tender scar again. The other injuries were simply gone. The mostly dried blood that still covered him could have come from someone else.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine frowned. “It still does not respond,” she murmured, half to herself. “It will not heal completely.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“That is the one that will kill me, isn’t it?” he asked her softly, then quoted, “ ‘His blood on the rocks of Shayol Ghul, washing away the Shadow, sacrifice for man’s salvation.’ ”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You read too much,” she said sharply, “and understand too little.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Do you understand more? If you do, then tell me.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He is only trying to find his way,” Lan said suddenly. “No man likes to run forward blindly when he knows there is a cliff somewhere ahead.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin gave a twitch of surprise. Lan almost never disagreed with Moiraine, or at least not where anyone could overhear. He and Rand had been spending a good deal of time together, though, practicing the sword.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine’s dark eyes flashed, but what she said was “He needs to be in bed. Will you ask that washwater be brought, and another bedchamber prepared? This one needs a thorough cleaning and a new mattress.” Lan nodded and put his head into the anteroom for a moment, speaking quietly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I will sleep here, Moiraine.” Letting go of the bedpost, Rand pushed himself erect, grounding <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>’s point on the littered carpet and resting both hands on the hilt. If he leaned a little on the sword, it did not show much. “I won’t be chased any more. Not even out of a bed.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“<span class="calibre18">Tai’ shar Manetheren</span>,” Lan murmured.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">This time even Rhuarc looked startled, but if Moiraine heard the Warder compliment Rand, she gave no sign of it. She was staring at Rand, her face smooth but thunderheads in her eyes. Rand wore a quizzical little smile, as if wondering what she would try next.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin edged toward the doors. If Rand and the Aes Sedai were going to match wills, he would just as soon be elsewhere. Lan did not appear to care; it was hard to tell with that stance of his, somehow standing with his back straight and slouching at the same time. He could have been bored enough to sleep where he stood or ready to draw his sword; his manner suggested either, or both. Rhuarc stood much the same, but he was eyeing the doors, too.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Stay where you are!” Moiraine did not look away from Rand, and her outflung finger pointed halfway between Perrin and Rhuarc, but Perrin’s feet stopped just the same. Rhuarc shrugged and folded his arms.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Stubborn,” Moiraine muttered. This time the word was for Rand. “Very well. If you mean to stand there until you drop, you can use the time before you fall on your face to tell me what occurred here. I cannot teach you,
but if you tell me perhaps I can see what you did wrong. A small chance, but perhaps I can.” Her voice sharpened. “You must learn to control it, and I do not mean just because of things like this. If you do not learn to control the Power, it will kill you. You know that. I have told you often enough. You must teach yourself. You must find it within yourself.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I did nothing except survive,” he said in a dry voice. She opened her mouth, but he went on. “Do you think I could channel and not know it? I didn’t do it in my sleep. This happened awake.” He wavered, and caught himself on the sword.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Even you could not channel anything but Spirit asleep,” Moiraine said coolly, “and this was never done with Spirit. I was about to ask what <span class="calibre18">did</span> happen.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin felt his hackles rising as Rand told his story. The axe had been bad enough, but at least the axe was something solid, something real. To have your own reflection jump out of mirrors at you . . . . Unconsciously he shifted his feet, trying not to stand on any fragments of glass.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Soon after he began speaking, Rand glanced behind him at the chest, a quick look, as if he did not want it observed. After a moment the slivers of silvered glass that were scattered across the lid of the chest stirred and slid off onto the carpet as though pushed by an unseen broom. Rand exchanged looks with Moiraine, then sat down slowly and went on. Perrin was not sure which of them had cleared the chest top. There was no mention of Berelain in the tale.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It must have been one of the Forsaken,” Rand finished at last. “Maybe Sammael. You said he’s in Illian. Unless one of them is here in Tear. Could Sammael reach the Stone from Illian?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Not even if <span class="calibre18">he</span> held <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>,” Moiraine told him. “There are limits. Sammael is only a man, not the Dark One.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Only a man? Not a very good description, Perrin thought. A man who could channel, but who somehow had not gone mad; at least, not yet, not that anyone knew. A man perhaps as strong as Rand, but where Rand was trying to learn, Sammael knew every trick of his talents already. A man who had spent three thousand years trapped in the Dark One’s prison, a man who had gone over to the Shadow of his own choice. No. “Only a man” did not begin to describe Sammael, or any of the Forsaken, male or female.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Then one of them is here. In the city.” Rand put his head down on his wrists, but jerked himself erect immediately, glaring at those in the room.
“I’ll not be chased again. I’ll be the hound, first. I will find him—or her—and I will—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Not one of the Forsaken,” Moiraine cut in. “I think not. This was too simple. And too complex.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand spoke calmly. “No riddles, Moiraine. If not the Forsaken, who? Or what?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Aes Sedai’s face could have done for an anvil, yet she hesitated, feeling her way. There was no telling whether she was unsure of the answer or deciding how much to reveal.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“As the seals holding the Dark One’s prison weaken,” she said after a time, “it may be inevitable that a . . . miasma . . . will escape even while he is still held. Like bubbles rising from the things rotting on the bottom of a pond. But these bubbles will drift through the Pattern until they attach to a thread and burst.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Light!” It slipped out before Perrin could stop it. Moiraine’s eyes turned to him. “You mean what happened to . . . to Rand is going to start happening to everybody?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Not to everyone. Not yet, at least. In the beginning I think there will only be a few bubbles, slipping through cracks the Dark One can reach through. Later, who can say? And just as <span class="calibre18">ta’veren</span> bend the other threads in the Pattern around them, I think perhaps <span class="calibre18">ta’veren</span> will tend to attract these bubbles more powerfully than others do.” Her eyes said she knew Rand was not the only one to have had a waking nightmare. A brief touch of a smile, there and gone almost before he saw it, said he could keep silent if he wished to hold it secret from others. But she knew. “Yet in the months to come—the years, should we be lucky enough to have that long—I fear a good many people will see things to give them white hairs, if they survive.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Mat,” Rand said. “Do you know if he . . . ? Is he . . . ?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I will know soon enough,” Moiraine replied calmly. “What is done cannot be undone, but we can hope.” Whatever her tone, though, she smelled ill at ease until Rhuarc spoke.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He is well. Or was. I saw him on my way here.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Going where?” Moiraine said with an edge in her voice.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He looked to be heading for the servants’ quarters,” the Aielman told her. He knew that the three were <span class="calibre18">ta’veren</span>, if not as much else as he thought he did, and he knew Mat well enough to add, “Not the stables, Aes Sedai. The other way, toward the river. And there are no boats at the Stone’s docks.” He did not stumble over words like “boat” and “dock” the way
most of the Aiel did, although in the Waste such things existed only in stories.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She nodded as if she had expected nothing else. Perrin shook his head; she was so used to hiding her real thoughts, she seemed to veil them out of habit.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Suddenly one of the doors opened and Bain and Chiad slipped in, without their spears. Bain was carrying a large white bowl and a fat pitcher with steam rising from the top. Chiad had towels folded under her arm.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Why are <span class="calibre18">you</span> bringing this?” Moiraine demanded.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Chiad shrugged. “She would not come in.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand barked a laugh. “Even the servants know enough to stay clear of me. Put it anywhere.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Your time is running out, Rand,” Moiraine said. “The Tairens are becoming used to you, after a fashion, and no one fears what is familiar as much as what is strange. How many weeks, or days, before someone tries to put an arrow in your back or poison in your food? How long before one of the Forsaken strikes, or another bubble comes sliding along the Pattern?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Don’t try to harry me, Moiraine.” He was blood filthy, half naked, more than half leaning on <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> to stay sitting up, but he managed to fill those words with quiet command. “I will not run for you, either.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Choose your way soon,” she said. “And this time, inform me what you mean to do. My knowledge cannot aid you if you refuse to accept my help.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Your help?” Rand said wearily. “I’ll take your help. But I will decide, not you.” He looked at Perrin as if trying to tell him something without words, something he did not want the others to hear. Perrin had not a clue what it was. After a moment Rand sighed; his head sank a little. “I want to sleep. All of you, go away. Please. We will talk tomorrow.” His eyes flickered to Perrin again, underscoring the words for him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine crossed the room to Bain and Chiad, and the two Aiel women leaned close so she could speak for their ears alone. Perrin heard only a buzz, and wondered if she was using the Power to stop him eavesdropping. She knew the keenness of his hearing. He was sure of it when Bain whispered back and he still could not make out anything. The Aes Sedai had done nothing about his sense of smell, though. The Aiel women looked at Rand as they listened, and they smelled wary. Not afraid, but as if Rand were a large animal that would be dangerous if they misstepped.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Aes Sedai turned back to Rand. “We <span class="calibre18">will</span> talk tomorrow. You cannot sit like a partridge waiting for a hunter’s net.” She was moving for the
door before Rand could reply. Lan looked at Rand as if about to say something, but followed her without speaking.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Rand?” Perrin said.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We do what we have to.” Rand did not look up from the clear hilt between his hands. “We all do what we have to.” He smelled afraid.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin nodded and followed Rhuarc out of the room. Moiraine and Lan were nowhere in sight. The Tairen officer was staring at the doors from ten paces off, trying to pretend the distance was his choice and had nothing to do with the four Aiel women watching him. The other two Maidens were still in the bedchamber, Perrin realized. He heard voices from the room.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Go away,” Rand said tiredly. “Just put that down and go away.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“If you can stand up,” Chiad said cheerfully, “we will. Only stand.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">There was the sound of water splashing into a bowl. “We have tended to wounded before,” Bain said in soothing tones. “And I used to wash my brothers when they were little.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rhuarc pushed the door shut, cutting off the rest.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You do not treat him the way the Tairens do,” Perrin said quietly. “No bowing and scraping. I don’t think I have heard one of you call him Lord Dragon.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The Dragon Reborn is a wetlander prophecy,” Rhuarc said. “Ours is He Who Comes With the Dawn.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I thought they were the same. Else why did you come to the Stone? Burn me, Rhuarc, you Aiel are the People of the Dragon, just as the Prophecies say. You’ve as good as admitted it, even if you won’t say it out loud.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rhuarc ignored the last part. “In your Prophecies of the Dragon, the fall of the Stone and the taking of <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> proclaim that the Dragon has been Reborn. Our prophecy says only that the Stone must fall before He Who Comes With the Dawn appears to take us back to what was ours. They may be one man, but I doubt even the Wise Ones could say for sure. If Rand is the one, there are things he must do yet to prove it.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What?” Perrin demanded.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“If he is the one, he will know, and do them. If he does not, then our search still goes on.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Something unreadable in the Aielman’s voice pricked Perrin’s ears. “And if he isn’t the one you search for? What then, Rhuarc?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Sleep well and safely, Perrin.” Rhuarc’s soft boots made no sound on the black marble as he walked away.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Tairen officer was still staring past the Maidens, smelling of fear,
failing to mask the anger and hatred on his face. If the Aiel decided Rand was not He Who Comes With the Dawn . . . . Perrin studied the Tairen officer’s face and thought of the Maidens not being there, of the Stone empty of Aiel, and he shivered. He had to make sure Faile decided to leave. That was all there was for it. She had to decide to go, and without him.</span></div>
