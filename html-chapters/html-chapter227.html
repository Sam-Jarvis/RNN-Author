<div class="subtitle-chapter"><span class="calibre2"><span class="calibre18">Tanchico or the Tower</span></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">E</span>layne drew a ragged, relieved breath as Egwene finally stirred and opened her eyes. At the foot of the bed, Aviendha’s features lost their tinge of frustration and anxiety, and she flashed a quick smile that Egwene returned. The candle had burned past the mark minutes ago; it seemed an hour.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You would not wake up,” Elayne said unsteadily. “I shook you and shook you, but you would not wake.” She gave a small laugh. “Oh, Egwene, you even frightened Aviendha.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene put a hand on her arm and squeezed reassuringly. “I am back, now.” She sounded tired, and she had sweated her shift through. “I suppose I had reason to stay a little longer than we planned. I will be more careful next time. I promise.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nynaeve returned the pitcher of water to the washstand vigorously, sloshing some out. She had been on the point of throwing it in Egwene’s sleeping face. Her features were composed, but the pitcher rattled the washbowl, and she let the spilled water drip to the carpet. “Was it something you found? Or was it . . . ? Egwene, if the World of Dreams can hold on to you in some way, maybe it is too dangerous until you learn more. Maybe the more often you go, the harder it is to come back. Maybe . . . . I don’t know. But I do know we cannot risk letting you become lost.” She crossed her arms under her breasts, ready for an argument.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I know,” Egwene said, very close to meekly. Elayne’s eyebrows shot up; Egwene was never meek with Nynaeve. Anything but.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene struggled off the bed, refusing Elayne’s help, and made her way to the washstand to bathe her face and arms in the relatively cool water. Elayne found a dry shift in the wardrobe while Egwene pulled off her sodden one.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I met a Wise One, a woman named Amys.” Egwene’s voice was muffled until her head popped out of the top of the new shift. “She said I should come to her, to learn about <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span>. At some place in the Waste called Cold Rocks Hold.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne had caught a flicker of Aviendha’s eye at the mention of the Wise One’s name. “Do you know her? Amys?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Aiel woman’s nod could only be described as reluctant. “A Wise One. A dreamwalker. Amys was <span class="calibre18">Far Dareis Mai</span> until she gave up the spear to go to Rhuidean.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“A Maiden!” Egwene exclaimed. “So that’s why she . . . . No matter. She said she is at Rhuidean, now. Do you know where this Cold Rocks Hold is, Aviendha?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Of course. Cold Rocks is Rhuarc’s hold. Rhuarc is Amys’s husband. I visit there, sometimes. I used to. My sister-mother, Lian, is sister-wife to Amys.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne exchanged confused glances with Egwene and Nynaeve. Once Elayne had thought she knew a good bit about Aiel, all learned from her teachers in Caemlyn, but she had discovered since meeting Aviendha how little she did know. Customs and relationships all were a maze. First-sisters meant having the same mother; except that it was possible for friends to <span class="calibre18">become</span> first-sisters by making a pledge before Wise Ones. Second-sisters meant your mothers were sisters; if your fathers were brothers, you were father-sisters, and not considered as closely related as second-sisters. After that, it truly grew bewildering.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What does  ‘sister-wife’ mean?” she asked hesitantly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“That you have the same husband.” Aviendha frowned at the way Egwene gasped and Nynaeve’s eyes opened as wide as they would go. Elayne had been half-expecting the answer, but she still found herself fussing with skirts that were perfectly straight. “This is not your custom?” the Aiel woman asked.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“No,” Egwene said faintly. “No, it is not.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“But you and Elayne care for one another as first-sisters. What would you have done had one of you been unwilling to step aside for Rand
al’Thor? Fight over him? Let a man damage the ties between you? Would it not have been better if you both had married him, then?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne looked at Egwene. The thought of . . . . Could she have done such a thing? Even with Egwene? She knew her cheeks were red. Egwene merely looked startled.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“But I wanted to step aside,” Egwene said.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne knew the remark was as much for her as for Aviendha, but the thought would not go away. Had Min had a viewing? What would she do if Min had? <span class="calibre18">If it’s Berelain, I will strangle her, and him too! If it has to be someone, why couldn’t it be Egwene? Light, what am I thinking?</span> She knew she was becoming flustered, and to cover it, she made her voice light. “You sound as if the man has no choice in the matter.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He can say no,” Aviendha said as if it were obvious, “but if he wishes to marry one, he must marry both when they ask. Please take no offense, but I was shocked when I learned that in your lands a man can ask a woman to marry him. A man should make his interest known, then wait for the woman to speak. Of course, some women lead a man to see where his interest lies, but the right of the question is hers. I do not really know very much of these things. I have wanted to be <span class="calibre18">Far Dareis Mai</span> since I was a child. All I want in life is the spear and my spear-sisters,” she finished quite fiercely.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“No one is going to try to make you marry,” Egwene said soothingly. Aviendha gave her a startled look.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nynaeve cleared her throat loudly. Elayne wondered if she had been thinking about Lan; there were certainly hard spots of color in her cheeks. “I suppose, Egwene,” Nynaeve said in a slightly too energetic voice, “that you did not find what you were looking for, or you would have said something by now.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I found nothing,” Egwene replied regretfully. “But Amys said . . . . Aviendha, what sort of woman is Amys?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Aiel woman had taken up a study of the carpet. “Amys is hard as the mountains and pitiless as the sun,” she said without looking up. “She is a dreamwalker. She can teach you. Once she lays her hands on you, she will drag you by the hair toward what she wants. Rhuarc is the only one who can stand up to her. Even the other Wise Ones step carefully when Amys speaks. But she can teach you.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene shook her head. “I meant would being in a strange place unsettle her, make her nervous? Being in a city? Would she see things that weren’t there?”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Aviendha’s laugh was a short, sharp sound. “Nervous? Waking to find a lion in her bed would not make Amys nervous. She was a Maiden, Egwene, and she has grown no softer, you can be sure of it.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What did this woman see?” Nynaeve asked.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It wasn’t something she saw, exactly,” Egwene said slowly. “I <span class="calibre18">think</span> not seeing. She said Tanchico had an evil in it. Worse than men could make, she said. That could be the Black Ajah. Don’t argue with me, Nynaeve,” she added in a firmer voice. “Dreams have to be interpreted. It very well could be.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nynaeve had begun frowning as soon as Egwene mentioned evil in Tanchico, and her frown turned to a heated glare when Egwene told her not to argue. Sometimes Elayne wanted to shake both women. She stepped in quickly, before the older woman could erupt. “It very well could be, Egwene. You did find something. More than Nynaeve or I thought you could. Didn’t she, Nynaeve? Don’t you think so?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It could be,” Nynaeve said grudgingly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It could be.” Egwene did not sound happy about it. She took a deep breath. “Nynaeve is right. I have to learn what I’m doing. If I knew what I should, I would not have had to be told about the evil. If I knew what I should, I could have found the very room Liandrin is staying in, wherever she is. Amys can teach me. That is why . . . . That is why I have to go to her.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Go to her?” Nynaeve sounded appalled. “Into the Waste?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Aviendha can take me right to this Cold Rocks Hold.” Egwene’s look, half-defiant, half-anxious, darted between Elayne and Nynaeve. “If I was certain they were in Tanchico, I wouldn’t let you go alone. If you decide to. But with Amys to help me, maybe I can find out where they are. Maybe I can . . . . That is just it; I do not even know what I’ll be able to do, only that I am certain it will be far more than I can now. It isn’t as if I will be abandoning you. You can take the ring with you. You know the Stone well enough to come back here in <span class="calibre18">Tel’aran’rhiod</span>. I can come to you in Tanchico. Whatever I learn from Amys, I can teach you. Please say you understand. I can learn so much from Amys, and then I can use it to help you. It will be as if all three of us had been trained by her. A dreamwalker; a woman who <span class="calibre18">knows</span>! Liandrin and the rest of them will be like children; they won’t know a quarter of what we do.” She chewed her lip, one pensive bite. “You don’t believe I am running out on you, do you? If you do, I won’t go.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Of course you must go,” Elayne told her. “I will miss you, but no one promised us we could stay together until this was done.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“But the two of you . . . going alone . . . I should go with you. If they really are in Tanchico, I should be with you.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Nonsense,” Nynaeve said briskly. “Training is what you need. That will do us far more good in the long run than your company to Tanchico. It isn’t even as if we know any of them are in Tanchico. If they are, Elayne and I will do very well together, but we could arrive and find that this evil is no more than the war after all. The Light knows, war should be evil enough for anyone. We may be back in the Tower before you are. You must be careful in the Waste,” she added in a practical tone. “It is a dangerous place. Aviendha, you will look after her?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Before the Aiel woman could open her mouth, there was a knock at the door, followed immediately by Moiraine. The Aes Sedai took them in with one sweeping look that weighed, measured and considered them and what they had been doing, all without the twitch of an eyelid to suggest her conclusions. “Joiya and Amico are dead,” she announced.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Was that the reason for the attack, then?” Nynaeve said. “All that to kill them? Or perhaps to kill them if they could not be freed. I’ve been sure Joiya was so confident because she expected rescue. She must have been lying after all. I never trusted her repentance.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Not the main purpose, perhaps,” Moiraine replied. “The captain very wisely kept his men to their posts in the dungeons during the attack. They never saw a single Trolloc or Myrddraal. But they found the pair dead, after. Each with her throat rather messily cut. After her tongue had been nailed to her cell door.” She might as well have been speaking of having a dress mended.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne’s stomach heaved leadenly at the detached description. “I would not have wanted that for them. Not like that. The Light illumine their souls.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“They sold their souls to the Shadow long ago,” Egwene said roughly. She had both hands pressed to her stomach, though. “How . . . . How was it done? Gray Men?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I doubt even Gray Men could have managed that,” Moiraine said dryly. “The Shadow has resources beyond what we know, it seems.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Yes.” Egwene smoothed her dress, and her voice. “If there was no attempt at rescue, it must mean they were both telling the truth. They were killed because they talked.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Or to stop them from it,” Nynaeve added grimly. “We can hope they do not know that those two told us anything. Perhaps Joiya did repent, but I’ll not believe it.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne swallowed, thinking of being in a cell, having your face pressed to the door so your tongue could be pulled out and . . . . She shivered, but made herself say, “They might have been killed simply to punish them for being captured.” She left out her thought that the killing might have been to make them believe whatever Joiya and Amico had said; they had enough doubts about what to do as it was. “Three possibilities, and only one says the Black Ajah knows they revealed a word. Since all three are equal, the chances are that they do not know.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene and Nynaeve looked shocked. “To <span class="calibre18">punish</span> them?” Nynaeve said incredulously.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">They were both tougher than she in many ways—she admired them for it—but they had not grown up watching the maneuverings at court in Caemlyn, hearing tales of the cruel way Cairhienin and Tairens played the Games of Houses.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I think the Black Ajah might be less than gentle with failure of any kind,” she told them. “I can imagine Liandrin ordering it. Joiya surely could have done it easily.” Moiraine eyed her briefly, a reassessing look.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Liandrin,” Egwene said, her tone absolutely flat. “Yes, I can imagine Liandrin or Joiya giving that command.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You did not have much longer to question them in any case,” Moiraine said. “They would have been shipbound by midday tomorrow.” A hint of anger touched her voice; Elayne realized Moiraine must see the Black sisters’ deaths as an escape from justice. “I hope you reach some decision soon. Tanchico or the Tower.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne met Nynaeve’s eyes and gave a slight nod.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nynaeve nodded back, more assertively, before turning to the Aes Sedai. “Elayne and I will be going to Tanchico as soon as we can find a ship. A fast ship, I hope. Egwene and Aviendha will be going to Cold Rocks Hold, in the Aiel Waste.” She gave no reasons, and Moiraine’s eyebrows rose.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Jolien can take her,” Aviendha said into the momentary silence. She avoided looking at Egwene. “Or Sefela, or Bain and Chiad. I . . . I have a thought to go with Elayne and Nynaeve. If there is war in this Tanchico, they have need of a sister to watch their backs.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“If that is what you want, Aviendha,” Egwene said slowly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She looked surprised and hurt, but no more surprised than Elayne. She had thought the two of them were becoming friends. “I am glad you want to help us, Aviendha, but you should be the one to take Egwene to Cold Rocks Hold.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“She is going neither to Tanchico nor Cold Rocks Hold,” Moiraine said, taking a letter from her pouch and unfolding the pages. “This was placed in my hand an hour gone. The young Aielman who brought it told me it was given to him a month ago, before any of us reached Tear, yet it is addressed to me by name, at the Stone of Tear.” She glanced at the last sheet. “Aviendha, do you know Amys, of the Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel; Bair, of the Haido sept of the Shaarad Aiel; Melaine, of the Jhirad sept of the Goshien Aiel; and Seana, of the Black Cliff sept of the Nakai Aiel? They signed it.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“They are all Wise Ones, Aes Sedai. All dreamwalkers.” Aviendha’s stance had shifted to wariness, though she did not seem aware of it. She looked ready to fight or flee.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Dreamwalkers,” Moiraine mused. “Perhaps that explains it. I have heard of dreamwalkers.” She turned to the second page of the letter. “Here is what they say about you. What they said perhaps before you had even decided to come to Tear.  ‘There is among the Maidens of the Spear in the Stone of Tear a willful girl called Aviendha, of the Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel. She must now come to us. There can be no more waiting or excuses. We will await her on the slopes of Chaendaer, above Rhuidean.’ There is more about you, but mainly telling me that I must see you come to them without delay. They issue commands like the Amyrlin, these Wise Ones of yours.” She made a vexed sound, which brought Elayne to wonder if the Wise Ones had tried issuing commands to the Aes Sedai, too. Not very likely. And unlikely to be successful if tried. Still, something about that letter irritated the Aes Sedai.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I am <span class="calibre18">Far Dareis Mai</span>,” Aviendha said angrily. “I do not go running like a child when someone calls my name. I will go to Tanchico if I wish.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne pursed her lips thoughtfully. This was something new from the Aiel woman. Not the anger—she had seen Aviendha angry before, if not quite to this degree—but the undertone. She could call it nothing but sulkiness. That seemed as unlikely as Lan being sulky, but there it was.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene heard it, too. She patted Aviendha’s arm. “It’s all right. If you want to go to Tanchico, I’ll be pleased that you are protecting Elayne and Nynaeve.” Aviendha gave her a truly miserable look.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Moiraine shook her head, only slightly, but still deliberate. “I showed this to Rhuarc.” Aviendha opened her mouth, her face irate, but the Aes Sedai raised her voice and went on smoothly. “As the letter asks me to. Only the part concerning you, of course. He seems quite determined that
you will do as the letter asks. As it orders. I think it wisest to do as Rhuarc and the Wise Ones wish, Aviendha. Do you not agree?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Aviendha stared around the room wildly, as at a trap. “I am <span class="calibre18">Far Dareis Mai</span>,” she muttered, and strode for the door without another word.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Egwene took a step, half-raising a hand to stop her, then let it fall as the door banged shut. “What do they want with her?” she demanded of Moiraine. “You always know more than you let on. What are you holding back this time?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Whatever the Wise Ones’ reason,” Moiraine said coolly, “it is surely a matter between Aviendha and them. If she wished you to know, she would have told you.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You cannot stop trying to maneuver people,” Nynaeve said bitterly. “You’re maneuvering Aviendha into something now, aren’t you?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Not I. The Wise Ones. And Rhuarc.” Moiraine folded the letter, returning it to her belt pouch with a touch of acerbity in her manner. “She can always say no to him. A clan chief is not the same as a king, as I understand Aiel ways.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Can she?” Elayne asked. Rhuarc reminded her of Gareth Bryne. The Captain-General of her mother’s Royal Guards had seldom put his foot down, but when he did, not even Morgase could bring him around, short of a royal command. There would be no command from the throne this time—not that Morgase had ever issued one to Gareth Bryne when he had decided he was right, now that Elayne thought of it—and without one, she expected that Aviendha was going to the slopes of Chaendaer, above Rhuidean. “At least she can journey with you, Egwene. Amys can hardly meet you at Cold Rocks Hold if she plans to wait for Aviendha at Rhuidean. You can go to Amys together.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“But I do not want her to,” Egwene said sadly. “Not if she doesn’t want to.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Whatever anyone wants,” Nynaeve said, “we have work to do. You will need many things for a trip into the Waste, Egwene. Lan will tell me what. And Elayne and I must make preparations to sail for Tanchico. I suppose we can find a ship tomorrow, but that means deciding what to pack tonight.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“There is a ship of the Atha’an Miere at the docks in the Maule,” Moiraine told them. “A raker. There are no ships faster. You did want a fast ship.” Nynaeve gave a grudging nod.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Moiraine,” Elayne said, “what is Rand going to do now? After this attack . . . . Will he start the war you want?”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I do not want a war,” the Aes Sedai replied. “I want what will see him alive to fight Tarmon Gai’don. He says he will tell us all what he means to do tomorrow.” The smallest frown creased her smooth forehead. “Tomorrow, we will all know more than we do tonight.” Her departure was abrupt.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">Tomorrow</span>, Elayne thought. <span class="calibre18">What will he do when I tell him? What will he say? He has to understand</span>. Determinedly, she joined the other two to discuss their preparations.</span></div>
