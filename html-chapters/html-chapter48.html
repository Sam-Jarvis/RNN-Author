<div class="cst"><b class="calibre7"><i class="calibre5">Decisions and Apparitions</i></b></div>
<div class="tx"><b class="calibre7">T</b>he Aes Sedai appeared to know what Loial meant, but she said nothing. Loial peered at the floor, rubbing under his nose with a thick finger, as if he was abashed by his outburst. No one wanted to speak.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“Why?” Rand asked at last. “Why would we die? What <i class="calibre5">are</i>  the Ways?”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Loial glanced at Moiraine. She turned away to take a chair in front of the fireplace. The little cat stretched, its claws scratching on the hearthstone, and languidly walked over to butt its head against her ankles. She rubbed behind its ears with one finger. The cat’s purring was a strange counterpoint to the Aes Sedai’s level voice. “It is your knowledge, Loial. The Ways are the only path to safety for us, the only path to forestalling the Dark One, if only for a time, but the telling is yours.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The Ogier did not appear comforted by her speech. He shifted awkwardly on his chair before beginning. “During the Time of Madness, while the world was still being broken, the earth was in upheaval, and humankind was being scattered like dust on the wind. We Ogier were scattered, too, driven from the <i class="calibre5">stedding</i>, into the Exile and the Long Wandering, when the Longing was graven on our hearts.” He gave Moiraine another sidelong look. His long eyebrows drew down into two points. “I will try to be brief, but this is not a thing that can be told too briefly. It is of the others I must speak, now, those few Ogier who held in their <i class="calibre5">stedding</i> while around them the world was  tearing apart. And of the Aes Sedai”—he avoided looking at Moiraine, now—“the male Aes Sedai who were dying even as they destroyed the world in their madness. It was to those Aes Sedai—those who had so far managed to avoid the madness—that the <i class="calibre5">stedding</i> first made the offer of sanctuary. Many accepted, for in the <i class="calibre5">stedding</i> they were protected from the taint of the Dark One that was killing their kind. But they were cut off from the True Source. It was not just that they could not wield the One Power, or touch the Source; they could no longer even sense that the Source existed. In the end, none could accept that isolation, and one by one they left the <i class="calibre5">stedding</i>, hoping that by that time the taint was gone. It never was.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“Some in Tar Valon,” Moiraine said quietly, “claim that Ogier sanctuary prolonged the Breaking and made it worse. Others say that if all of those men had been allowed to go mad at once, there would have been nothing left of the world. I am of the Blue Ajah, Loial; unlike the Red Ajah, we hold to the second view. Sanctuary helped to save what could be saved. Continue, please.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Loial nodded gratefully. Relieved of a concern, Rand realized.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“As I was saying,” the Ogier went on, “the Aes Sedai, the male Sedai, left. But before they went, they gave a gift to the Ogier in thanks for our sanctuary. The Ways. Enter a Waygate, walk for a day, and you may depart through another Waygate a hundred miles from where you started. Or five hundred. Time and distance are strange in the Ways. Different paths, different bridges, lead to different places, and how long it takes to get there depends on which path you take. It was a marvelous gift, made more so by the times, for the Ways are not part of the world we see around us, nor perhaps of any world outside themselves. Not only did the Ogier so gifted not have to travel through the world, where even after the Breaking men fought like animals to live, in order to reach another <i class="calibre5">stedding</i>, but within the Ways there was no Breaking. The land between two  <i class="calibre5">stedding</i> might split open into deep canyons or rise in mountain ranges, but in the Way between them there was no change.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“When the last Aes Sedai left the <i class="calibre5">stedding</i>, they gave to the Elders a key, a talisman, that could be used for growing more. They are a living thing in some fashion, the Ways and the Waygates. I do not understand it; no Ogier ever has, and even the Aes Sedai have forgotten, I am told. Over the years the Exile ended for us. As those Ogier who had been gifted by the Aes Sedai found a <i class="calibre5">stedding</i> where Ogier had returned from the Long Wandering, they grew a Way to it. With the stonework we learned during the Exile, we built cities for men, and planted the groves to comfort the Ogier who did the building, so the Longing would not overcome them. To those groves Ways were grown. There was a grove, and a Waygate, at Mafal Dadaranell, but that city was razed during the Trolloc Wars, no stone left standing on another, and the grove was chopped down and burned for Trolloc fires.” He left no doubt which had been the greater crime.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“Waygates are all but impossible to destroy,” Moiraine said, “and humankind not much less so. There are people at Fal Dara still, though not the great city the Ogier built, and the Waygate yet stands.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“How did they make them?” Egwene asked. Her puzzled look took in Moiraine and Loial both. “The Aes Sedai, the men. If they couldn’t use the One Power in a <i class="calibre5">stedding</i>, how could they make the Ways? Or did they use the Power at all? Their part of the True Source was tainted. Is tainted. I don’t know much about what Aes Sedai can do, yet. Maybe it’s a silly question.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Loial explained. “Each <i class="calibre5">stedding</i> has a Waygate on its border, but outside. Your question is not silly. You’ve found the seed of why we do not dare travel the Ways. No Ogier has used the Ways in my lifetime, and before. By edict of the Elders, all the Elders of all the <i class="calibre5">stedding</i>, none may, human or Ogier.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“The Ways were made by men wielding Power fouled by the Dark One. About a thousand years ago, during what you humans call the War of the Hundred Years, the Ways began to change. So slowly in the beginning that none really noticed, they grew dank and dim. Then darkness fell along the bridges. Some who went in were never seen again. Travelers spoke of being watched from the dark. The numbers who vanished grew, and some who came out had gone mad, raving about <i class="calibre5">Machin Shin</i>, the Black Wind. Aes Sedai Healers could aid some, but even with Aes Sedai help they were never the same. And they never remembered anything of what had occurred. Yet it was  as if the darkness had sunken into their bones. They never laughed again, and they feared the sound of the wind.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">For a moment there was silence but for the cat purring beside Moiraine’s chair, and the snap and crackle of the fire, popping out sparks. Then Nynaeve burst out angrily, “And you expect us to follow you into that? You must be mad!”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“Which would you choose instead?” Moiraine asked quietly. “The Whitecloaks within Caemlyn, or the Trollocs without? Remember that my presence in itself gives some protection from the Dark One’s works.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Nynaeve settled back with an exasperated sigh.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“You still have not explained to me,” Loial said, “why I should break the edict of the Elders. And I have no desire to enter the Ways. Muddy as they often are, the roads men make have served me well enough since I left Stedding Shangtai.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“Humankind and Ogier, everything that lives, we are at war with the Dark One,” Moiraine said. “The greater part of the world does not even know it yet, and most of the few who do fight skirmishes and believe they are battles. While the world refuses to believe, the Dark One may be at the brink of victory. There is enough power in the Eye of the World to undo his prison. If the Dark One has found some way to bend the Eye of the World to his use....”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Rand wished the lamps in the room were lit. Evening was creeping over Caemlyn, and the fire in the fireplace did not give enough light. He wanted no shadows in the room.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“What can we do?” Mat burst out. “Why are we so important? Why do we have to go to the Blight? The Blight!”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Moiraine did not raise her voice, but it filled the room, compelling. Her chair by the fire suddenly seemed like a throne. Suddenly even Morgase would have paled in her presence. “One thing we can do. We can try. What seems like chance is often the Pattern. Three threads have come together here, each giving a warning: the Eye. It cannot be chance; it is the Pattern. You three did not choose; you were chosen by the Pattern. And you are here, where the danger is known. You can step aside, and perhaps doom the world. Running, hiding, will not save you from the weaving of the Pattern. Or you can try. You can go to the Eye of the World, three <i class="calibre5">ta’veren</i>, three centerpoints of the Web, placed where the danger lies. Let the  Pattern be woven around you there, and you may save the world from the Shadow. The choice is yours. I cannot make you go.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“I’ll go,” Rand said, trying to sound resolute. However hard he sought the void, images kept flashing through his head. Tam, and the farmhouse, and the flock in the pasture. It had been a good life; he had never really wanted anything more. There was comfort—a small comfort—hearing Perrin and Mat add their agreement to his. They sounded as dry-mouthed as he.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“I suppose there isn’t any choice for Egwene or me, either,” Nynaeve said.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Moiraine nodded. “You are part of the Pattern, too, both of you, in some fashion. Perhaps not <i class="calibre5">ta’veren</i>—perhaps—but strong even so. I have known it since Baerlon. And no doubt by this time the Fades know it, too. And Ba’alzamon. Yet you have as much choice as the young men. You could remain here, proceed to Tar Valon once the rest of us have gone.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“Stay behind!” Egwene exclaimed. “Let the rest of you go off into danger while we hide under the covers? I won’t do it!” She caught the Aes Sedai’s eye and drew back a little, but not all of her defiance vanished. “I won’t do it,” she muttered stubbornly.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“I suppose that means both of us will accompany you.” Nynaeve sounded resigned, but her eyes flashed when she added, “You still need my herbs, Aes Sedai, unless you’ve suddenly gained some ability I don’t know about.” Her voice held a challenge Rand did not understand, but Moiraine merely nodded and turned to the Ogier.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“Well, Loial, son of Arent son of Halan?”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Loial opened his mouth twice, his tufted ears twitching, before he spoke. “Yes, well. The Green Man. The Eye of the World. They’re mentioned in the books, of course, but I don’t think any Ogier has actually seen them in, oh, quite a long time. I suppose.... But must it be the Ways?” Moiraine nodded, and his long eyebrows sagged till the ends brushed his cheeks. “Very well, then. I suppose I must guide you. Elder Haman would say it’s no less than I deserve for being so hasty all the time.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“Our choices are made, then,” Moiraine said. “And now  that they are made, we must decide what to do about them, and how.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Long into the night they planned. Moiraine did most of it, with Loial’s advice concerning the Ways, but she listened to questions and suggestions from everyone. Once dark fell Lan joined them, adding his comments in that iron-cored drawl. Nynaeve made a list of what supplies they needed, dipping her pen in the inkwell with a steady hand despite the way she kept muttering under her breath.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Rand wished he could be as matter-of-fact as the Wisdom. He could not stop pacing up and down, as if he had energy to burn or burst from it. He knew his decision was made, knew it was the only one he could make with the knowledge he had, but that did not make him like it. The Blight. Shayol Ghul was somewhere in the Blight, beyond the Blasted Lands.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">He could see the same worry in Mat’s eyes, the same fear he knew was in his own. Mat sat with his hands clasped, knuckles white. If he let go, Rand thought, he would be clutching the dagger from Shadar Logoth instead.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">There was no worry on Perrin’s face at all, but what was there was worse: a mask of weary resignation. Perrin looked as though he had fought something until he could fight it no longer and was waiting for it to finish him. Yet sometimes....</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“We do what we must, Rand,” he said. “The Blight....” For an instant those yellow eyes lit with eagerness, flashing in the fixed tiredness of his face, as if they had a life of their own apart from the big blacksmith’s apprentice. “There’s good hunting along the Blight,” he whispered. Then he shuddered, as if he had just heard what he had said, and once more his face was resigned.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">And Egwene. Rand drew her apart at one point, over by the fireplace where those planning around the table could not hear. “Egwene, I....” Her eyes, like big dark pools drawing him in, made him stop and swallow. “It’s me the Dark One’s after, Egwene. Me, and Mat, and Perrin. I don’t care what Moiraine Sedai says. In the morning you and Nynaeve could start for home, or Tar Valon, or anywhere you want to go, and nobody will try to stop you. Not the Trollocs, not the Fades, not anybody. As long as you aren’t with us. Go home, Egwene. Or go to Tar Valon. But go.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">He waited for her to tell him she had as much right to go where she wanted as he did, that he had no right to tell her what to do. To his surprise, she smiled and touched his cheek.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“Thank you, Rand,” she said softly. He blinked, and closed his mouth as she went on. “You know I can’t, though. Moiraine Sedai told us what Min saw, in Baerlon. You should have told me who Min was. I thought.... Well, Min says I am part of this, too. And Nynaeve. Maybe I’m not <i class="calibre5">ta’veren</i>,” she stumbled over the word, “but the Pattern sends me to the Eye of the World, too, it seems. Whatever involves you, involves me.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“But, Egwene—”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“Who is Elayne?”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">For a minute he stared at her, then told the simple truth. “She’s the Daughter-Heir to the throne of Andor.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Her eyes seemed to catch fire. “If you can’t be serious for more than a minute, Rand al’Thor, I do not want to talk to you.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Incredulous, he watched her stiff back return to the table, where she leaned on her elbows next to Moiraine to listen to what the Warder was saying. <i class="calibre5">I need to talk to Perrin</i>, he thought. <i class="calibre5">He knows how to deal with women.</i></div>
<div class="fmtx1">Master Gill entered several times, first to light the lamps, then to bring food with his own hands, and later to report on what was happening outside. Whitecloaks were watching the inn from down the street in both directions. There had been a riot at the gates to the Inner City, with the Queen’s Guards arresting white cockades and red alike. Someone had tried to scratch the Dragon’s Fang on the front door and been sent on his way by Lamgwin’s boot.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">If the innkeeper found it odd that Loial was with them, he gave no sign of it. He answered the few questions Moiraine put to him without trying to discover what they were planning, and each time he came he knocked at the door and waited till Lan opened it for him, just as if it were not his inn and his library. On his last visit, Moiraine gave him the sheet of parchment covered in Nynaeve’s neat hand.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“It won’t be easy this time of night,” he said, shaking his head as he perused the list, “but I’ll arrange it all.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Moiraine added a small wash-leather bag that clinked as she  handed it to him by the drawstrings. “Good. And see that we are wakened before daybreak. The watchers will be at their least alert, then.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“We’ll leave them watching an empty box, Aes Sedai.” Master Gill grinned.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Rand was yawning by the time he shuffled out of the room with the rest in search of baths and beds. As he scrubbed himself, with a coarse cloth in one hand and a big yellow cake of soap in the other, his eyes drifted to the stool beside Mat’s tub. The golden-sheathed tip of the dagger from Shadar Logoth peeked from under the edge of Mat’s neatly folded coat. Lan glanced at it from time to time, too. Rand wondered if it was really as safe to have around as Moiraine claimed.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“Do you think my da’ll ever believe it?” Mat laughed, scrubbing his back with a long-handled brush. “Me, saving the world? My sisters won’t know whether to laugh or cry.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">He sounded like the old Mat. Rand wished he could forget the dagger.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">It was pitch-black when he and Mat finally got up to their room under the eaves, the stars obscured by clouds. For the first time in a long while Mat undressed before getting into bed, but he casually tucked the dagger under his pillow, too. Rand blew out the candle and crawled into his own bed. He could feel the wrongness from the other bed, not from Mat, but from beneath his pillow. He was still worrying about it when sleep came.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">From the first he knew it was a dream, one of those dreams that was not entirely dream. He stood staring at the wooden door, its surface dark and cracked and rough with splinters. The air was cold and dank, thick with the smell of decay. In the distance water dripped, the splashes hollow echoes down stone corridors.</div>
<div class="fmtx1"><i class="calibre5">Deny it. Deny him, and his power fails.</i></div>
<div class="fmtx1">He closed his eyes and concentrated on The Queen’s Blessing, on his bed, on himself asleep in his bed. When he opened his eyes the door was still there. The echoing splashes came on his heartbeat, as if his pulse counted time for them. He sought the flame and the void, as Tam had taught him, and found inner calm, but nothing outside of him changed. Slowly he opened the door and went in.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Everything was as he remembered it in the room that seemed burned out of the living rock. Tall, arched windows led onto an unrailed balcony, and beyond it the layered clouds streamed like a river in flood. The black metal lamps, their flames too bright to look at, gleamed, black yet somehow as bright as silver. The fire roared but gave no heat in the fearsome fireplace, each stone still vaguely like a face in torment.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">All was the same, but one thing was different. On the polished tabletop stood three small figures, the rough, featureless shapes of men, as if the sculptor had been hasty with his clay. Beside one stood a wolf, its clear detail emphasized by the crudeness of the man-shape, and another clutched a tiny dagger, a point of red on the hilt glittering in the light. The last held a sword. The hair stirring on the back of his neck, he moved close enough to see the heron in exquisite detail on that small blade.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">His head jerked up in panic, and he stared directly into the lone mirror. His reflection was still a blur, but not so misty as before. He could almost make out his own features. If he imagined he was squinting, he could nearly tell who it was.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“You’ve hidden from me too long.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">He whirled from the table, breath rasping his throat. A moment before he had been alone, but now Ba’alzamon stood before the windows. When he spoke caverns of flame replaced his eyes and mouth.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“Too long, but not much longer.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“I deny you,” Rand said hoarsely. “I deny that you hold any power over me. I deny that you are.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Ba’alzamon laughed, a rich sound rolling from fire. “Do you think it is that easy? But then, you always did. Each time we have stood like this, you have thought you could defy me.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“What do mean, each time? I deny you!”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“You always do. In the beginning. This contest between us has taken place countless times before. Each time your face is different, and your name, but each time it is you.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“I deny you.” It was a desperate whisper.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“Each time you throw your puny strength against me, and each time, in the end, you know which of us is the master. Age after Age, you kneel to me, or die wishing you still had strength to kneel. Poor fool, you can never win against me.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“Liar!” he shouted. “Father of Lies. Father of Fools if you can’t do better than that. Men found you in the last Age, in the Age of Legends, and bound you back where you belong.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Ba’alzamon laughed again, peal after mocking peal, until Rand wanted to cover his ears to shut it out. He forced his hands to stay at his sides. Void or no, they were trembling when the laughter finally stopped.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“You worm, you know nothing at all. As ignorant as a beetle under a rock, and as easily crushed. This struggle has gone on since the moment of creation. Always men think it a new war, but it is just the same war discovered anew. Only now change blows on the winds of time. Change. This time there will be no drifting back. Those proud Aes Sedai who think to stand you up against me. I will dress them in chains and send them running naked to do my bidding, or stuff their souls into the Pit of Doom to scream for eternity. All but those who already serve me. They will stand but a step beneath me. You can choose to stand with them, with the world groveling at your feet. I offer it one more time, one last time. You can stand above them, above every power and dominion but mine. There have been times when you made that choice, times when you lived long enough to know your power.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1"><i class="calibre5">Deny him!</i> Rand grabbed hold to what he could deny. “No Aes Sedai serve you. Another lie!”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“Is that what they told you? Two thousand years ago I took my Trollocs across the world, and even among Aes Sedai I found those who knew despair, who knew the world could not stand before Shai’tan. For two thousand years the Black Ajah has dwelt among the others, unseen in the shadows. Perhaps even those who claim to help you.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Rand shook his head, trying to shake away the doubts that came welling up in him, all the doubts he had had about Moiraine, about what the Aes Sedai wanted with him, about what she planned for him. “What do you want from me?” he cried. <i class="calibre5">Deny him! Light help me deny him!</i></div>
<div class="fmtx1">“Kneel!” Ba’alzamon pointed to the floor at his feet. “Kneel, and acknowledge me your master! In the end, you will. You will be my creature, or you will die.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The last word echoed through the room, reverberating back on itself, doubling and redoubling, till Rand threw up his arms  as if to shield his head from a blow. Staggering back until he thumped into the table, he shouted, trying to drown the sound in his ears. “Noooooooooooo!”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">As he cried out, he spun, sweeping the figures to the floor. Something stabbed his hand, but he ignored it, stomping the clay to shapeless smears underfoot. But when his shout failed, the echo was still there, and growing stronger:</div>
<div class="fmtx1">die-die-die-die-die-DIE-DIE-DIE-DIE-DIE-DIE-DIE-DIE-DIE-DIE-DIE</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The sound pulled on him like a whirlpool, drawing him in, ripping the void in his mind to shreds. The light dimmed, and his vision narrowed down to a tunnel with Ba’alzamon standing tall in the last spot of brightness at the end, dwindling until it was the size of his hand, a fingernail, nothing. Around and around the echo whirled him, down into blackness and death.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The thump as he hit the floor woke him, still struggling to swim up out of that darkness. The room was dark, but not so dark as that. Frantically he tried to center on the flame, to shovel fear into it, but the calm of the void eluded him. Tremors ran down his arms and legs, but he held the image of the single flame until the blood stopped pounding in his ears.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Mat was tossing and twisting on his bed, groaning in his sleep. “... deny you, deny you, deny you....” It faded off into unintelligible moans.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Rand reached out to shake him awake, and at the first touch Mat sat up with a strangled grunt. For a minute Mat stared around wildly, then drew a long, shuddering breath and dropped his head into his hands. Abruptly he twisted around, digging under his pillow, then sank back clutching the ruby-hilted dagger in both hands on his chest. He turned his head to look at Rand, his face hidden in shadow. “He’s back, Rand.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“I know.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Mat nodded. “There were these three figures....”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“I saw them, too.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“He knows who I am, Rand. I picked up the one with the dagger, and he said, ‘So that’s who you are.’ And when I looked again, the figure had my face. My face, Rand! It looked like flesh. It felt like flesh. Light help me, I could feel my own hand gripping me, like I was the figure.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Rand was silent for a moment. “You have to keep denying him, Mat.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“I did, and he laughed. He kept talking about some eternal war, and saying we’d met like that a thousand times before, and.... Light, Rand, the Dark One knows me.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“He said the same thing to me. I don’t think he does,” he added slowly. “I don’t think he knows which of us....” <i class="calibre5">Which of us what?</i></div>
<div class="fmtx1">As he levered himself up, pain stabbed his hand. Making his way to the table, he managed to get the candle lit after three tries, then spread his hand open in the light. Driven into his palm was a thick splinter of dark wood, smooth and polished on one side. He stared at it, not breathing. Abruptly he was panting, plucking at the splinter, fumbling with haste.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“What’s the matter?” Mat asked.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“Nothing.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Finally he had it, and a sharp yank pulled it free. With a grunt of disgust he dropped it, but the grunt froze in his throat. As soon as the splinter left his fingers, it vanished.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The wound was still there in his hand, though, bleeding. There was water in the stoneware pitcher. He filled the basin, his hands shaking so that he splashed water onto the table. Hurriedly he washed his hands, kneading his palm till his thumb brought more blood, then washed them again. The thought of the smallest sliver remaining in his flesh terrified him.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“Light,” Mat said, “he made me feel dirty, too.” But he still lay where he was, holding the dagger in both hands.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“Yes,” Rand said. “Dirty.” He fumbled a towel from the stack beside the basin. There was a knock at the door, and he jumped. It came again. “Yes?” he said.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Moiraine put her head into the room. “You are awake already. Good. Dress quickly and come down. We must be away before first light.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“Now?” Mat groaned. “We haven’t had an hour’s sleep yet.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“An hour?” she said. “You have had four. Now hurry, we do not have much time.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Rand shared a confused look with Mat. He could remember  every second of the dream clearly. It had begun as soon as he closed his eyes, and lasted only minutes.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Something in that exchange must have communicated itself to Moiraine. She gave them a penetrating look and came all the way in. “What has happened? The dreams?”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">“He knows who I am,” Mat said. “The Dark One knows my face.”</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Rand held up his hand wordlessly, palm toward her. Even in the shadowed light from the one candle the blood was plain.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">The Aes Sedai stepped forward and grasped his upheld hand, her thumb across his palm covering the wound. Cold pierced him to the bone, so chill that his fingers cramped and he had to fight to keep them open. When she took her fingers away, the chill went, too.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">He turned his hand, then, stunned, scrubbed the thin smear of blood away. The wound was gone. Slowly he raised his eyes to meet those of the Aes Sedai.</div>
