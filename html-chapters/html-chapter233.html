<div class="subtitle-chapter"><span class="calibre2"><span class="calibre18">Into the Ways</span></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">B</span>uttoning up his coat, Perrin paused, looking at the axe, still secured on the wall as he had left it since drawing it out of the door. He did not like the idea of carrying the weapon again, but he untied the belt from the peg and buckled it around his waist anyway. The hammer he tied to his already stuffed saddlebags. Draping saddlebags and blanket roll over his shoulder, he gathered a filled quiver and his unstrung longbow from the corner.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The rising sun poured heat and light through the narrow windows. The rumpled bed was the only proof that anyone had stayed here. Already the room had lost the feel of him; it even seemed to smell empty, despite his own scent on the sheets. He never stayed anywhere long enough to make that feel cling past his readiness to leave. Never long enough to put down roots, make it any kind of home. <span class="calibre18">Well, I’m going home now</span>.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Turning his back on the already unoccupied room, he went out.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Gaul rose easily from where he had been squatting against the wall beneath a tapestry of men on horseback hunting lions. He bore all of his weapons, with two leather water bottles, and a rolled blanket and a small cookpot were strapped beside the worked-leather bow case on his back. He was alone.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“The others?” Perrin asked, and Gaul shook his head.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Too long away from the Three-fold Land. I warned you of that, Perrin.
These lands of yours are too wet; the air is like breathing water. There are too many people, too close together. They have seen more than they want of strange places.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I understand,” Perrin said, though what he understood was that there would be no rescue after all, no company of Aiel to drive the Whitecloaks out of the Two Rivers. He kept his disappointment inside. It was sharp after thinking he had escaped his fate, but he could not say he had not prepared himself for the alternative. No point in crying when the iron split; you just reforged it. “Did you have any trouble doing what I asked?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“None. I told one Tairen to take each thing you want to the Dragonwall Gate stable and tell no one of it; they will have seen one another there, but they will think the things are for me, and they will keep silent. The Dragonwall Gate. You would think the Spine of the World was just over the horizon, instead of a hundred leagues or more off.” The Aiel hesitated. “The girl and the Ogier make no secret of their preparations, Perrin. She has been trying to find the gleeman, and telling everyone she means to travel the Ways.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Scratching his beard, Perrin breathed heavily, close to a growl. “If she gives me away to Moiraine, I vow she’ll not sit down for a week.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“She is very handy with those knives,” Gaul said in a neutral tone.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Not handy enough. Not if she’s given me away.” Perrin hesitated. No company of Aiel. The gallows still waited. “Gaul, if anything happens to me, if I give you the word, take Faile away. She might not want to go, but take her anyway. See her safely out of the Two Rivers. Will you promise me that?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I will do what I can, Perrin. For the blood debt I owe you, I will.” Gaul sounded doubtful, but Perrin did not think Faile’s knives would be enough to stop him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">They took back passages as much as possible, and narrow stairs meant to carry servants unobtrusively. Perrin thought it too bad the Tairens had not given servants their own corridors, as well. Still, they saw few people even in the broad hallways with their gilded lamp stands and ornate hangings, and no nobles at all.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He commented on the absence, and Gaul said, “Rand al’Thor has called them to the Heart of the Stone.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin only grunted, but he hoped Moiraine had been among those summoned. He wondered whether this was Rand’s way of helping him escape her. Whatever the reason, he was glad enough to take advantage of it.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">They stepped out of the last cramped stairway onto the ground floor of the Stone, where cavernous hallways as wide as roads led to all the outer
gates. There were no wall hangings here. Black iron lamps in iron brackets high on the walls lit the windowless passages, and the floor was paved with broad, rough stones able to stand long wear from horses’ shod hooves. Perrin picked his pace up to a trot. The stables lay just in sight ahead down the great tunnel, the wide Dragonwall Gate itself standing open beyond and only a handful of Defenders for guard. Moiraine could not intercept them now, not without the Dark One’s own luck.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The stable’s open doorway was an arch fifteen paces across. Perrin took one step inside and stopped.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The air was heavy with the smell of straw and hay, underlaid with grain and oats, leather and horse manure. Stalls filled with fine Tairen horses, prized everywhere, lined the walls, with more in rows across the wide floor. Dozens of grooms were at work, currying and combing, mucking out, mending tack. Without pausing, one or another sometimes glanced at where Faile and Loial stood, booted and ready for travel. And beside them, Bain and Chiad, accoutered like Gaul with weapons and blankets, water bottles and cooking pot.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Are they why you only said you would try?” Perrin asked quietly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Gaul shrugged. “I will do what I can, but they will take her side. Chiad is Goshien.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Her clan makes a difference?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Her clan and mine have blood feud, Perrin, and I am no spear-sister to her. But perhaps the water oaths will hold her. I will not dance spears with her unless she offers.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin shook his head. A strange people. What were water oaths? What he said, though, was “Why are they with her?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Bain says they wish to see more of your lands, but I think it is the argument between you and Faile which fascinates them. They like her, and when they heard of this journey, they decided to go with her instead of you.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Well, as long as they keep her out of trouble.” He was surprised when Gaul threw back his head and laughed. It made him scratch his beard worriedly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Loial came toward them, long eyebrows sagging anxiously. His coat pockets bulged, as was usual when he was traveling, mainly with the angular shapes of books. At least his limp seemed better. “Faile is becoming impatient, Perrin. I think she might insist on leaving any minute. Please hurry. You could not even find the Waygate without me. Not that you should try, certainly. You humans make me leap about so I can hardly find my own head. Please hurry.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I will not leave him,” Faile called. “Not even if he is yet too stubborn and foolish to ask a simple favor. Should that be the case, he may still follow me like a lost puppy. I promise to scratch his ears and take care of him.” The Aiel women doubled over laughing.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Gaul leaped straight up suddenly, kicking higher, two paces or more above the floor, while twirling one of his spears. “We will follow like stalking ridgecats,” he shouted, “like hunting wolves.” He landed easily, lightly. Loial stared at him in amazement.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Bain, on the other hand, lazily combed her short, fiery hair with her fingers. “I have a fine wolfskin with my bedding in the hold,” she told Chiad in a bored voice. “Wolves are easily taken.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">A growl rose in Perrin’s throat, pulling both women’s eyes to him. For a moment Bain looked on the point of saying something more, but she frowned at his yellow stare and held her peace, not afraid, but suddenly wary.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“This puppy is not well housebroken yet,” Faile confided to the Aiel women.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin refused to look at her. Instead he went to the stall that held his dun stallion, as tall as any of the Tairen animals but heavier in shoulder and haunch. Waving away a groom, he bridled Stepper and led him out himself. The grooms had walked the horse, of course, but he had been confined enough to frisk in the quick steps that had made Perrin give him his name. Perrin soothed him with the sure confidence of a man who had shoed many horses. It was no trouble at all putting his high-cantled saddle on and lashing his saddlebags and blanket roll behind.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Gaul watched with no expression. He would not ride a horse unless he had to, and then not a step farther than absolutely necessary. None of the Aiel would. Perrin did not understand why. Pride, perhaps, in their ability to run for long distances. The Aiel made it seem more than that, but he suspected none of them could have explained.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The packhorse had to be readied too, of course, but that was quickly done, since everything Gaul had ordered was waiting in a neat pile. Food and waterskins. Oats and grain for the horses. None of that would be available in the Ways. A few other things, like hobbles, some horse medicines just in case, spare tinderbox and such. Most of the space in the wicker hampers went for leather bottles like those the Aiel used for water, only larger and filled with lamp oil. Once the lanterns, on long poles, were strapped atop the rest, it was done.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Thrusting his unstrung bow under the saddle girth, he swung up into
Stepper’s saddle with the pack animal’s lead in hand. And then had to wait, seething.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Loial was already mounted, on a huge, hairy-fetlocked horse, taller than any other in the stable by hands yet reduced nearly to pony size by the Ogier’s long legs hanging down. There had been a time when the Ogier was almost as unwilling a rider as the Aiel, but he was at home on a horse now. It was Faile who took her time, examining her mount almost as if she had never seen the glossy black mare before, though Perrin knew she had put the horse through her paces before buying, soon after they came to the Stone. The horse, Swallow by name, was a fine animal of Tairen breeding, with slender ankles and an arched neck, a prancer with the look of speed and endurance both, though shod too lightly for Perrin’s taste. Those shoes would not last. It was all another effort to put him in his place, whatever she thought that was.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">When Faile finally mounted, in her narrow divided skirts, she reined closer to Perrin. She rode well, woman and horse moving as one. “Why can you not ask, Perrin?” she said softly. “You tried to keep me away from where I belong, so now you have to ask. Can such a simple thing be so difficult?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Stone rang like a monstrous bell, the stable floor leaping, the ceiling quivering on the point of coming down. Stepper leaped, too, screaming, head flailing; it was all Perrin could do to keep his seat. Grooms scrambled off the floor where they had fallen and ran desperately to quiet horses rearing, shrieking, attempting to climb out of their stalls. Loial clung to the neck of his huge mount, but Faile sat Swallow surely as the mare danced and squealed wildly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand. Perrin knew it was him. The pull of <span class="calibre18">ta’veren</span> dragged at him, two whirlpools in a stream drawing one another. Coughing in the falling dust, he shook his head as hard as he could, straining not to dismount and run back up into the Stone. “We ride!” he shouted while tremors still shook the fortress. “We ride now, Loial! Now!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Faile seemed to see no more point to delay; she heeled her mare out of the stable beside Loial’s taller horse, their two pack animals pulled along, all galloping before they reached the Dragonwall Gate. The Defenders took one look and scattered, some still on hands and knees; it was their duty to keep people out of the Stone, and they had no orders to keep these in. Not that they would necessarily have been able to think straight enough to do so if they had had orders, not with the tremors just subsiding and the Stone still groaning above them.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin was right behind with his own packhorse, wishing the Ogier’s
animal could run faster, wishing he could leave Loial’s lumbering mount behind and outrun the suction trying to draw him back, that pull of <span class="calibre18">ta’veren</span> to <span class="calibre18">ta’veren</span>. They galloped together through the streets of Tear, toward the rising sun, barely slowing to avoid carts and carriages. Men in tight coats and women with layered aprons, still shaken by the upheaval, stared at them, dazed, sometimes barely leaping out of the way.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">At the walls of the inner city paving stones gave way to dirt, shoes and coats to bare feet and bare chests above baggy breeches held up by broad sashes. The folk here dodged no less assiduously, though, for Perrin would not let Stepper slow until they had galloped past the city’s outer wall, past the simple stone houses and shops that clustered outside the city proper, into a countryside of scattered farms and thickets and beyond the pull of <span class="calibre18">ta’veren</span>. Only then, breathing almost as hard as his lathered horse, he reined Stepper to a walk.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Loial’s ears were stiff with shock. Faile licked her lips and stared from the Ogier to Perrin, white-faced. “What happened? Was that . . . him?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I don’t know,” Perrin lied. <span class="calibre18">I have to go, Rand. You know that. You looked me in the face when I told you, and said I had to do what I thought I must</span>.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Where are Bain and Chiad?” Faile said. “It will take them an hour to catch up now. I wish they would ride. I offered to buy them horses, and they looked offended. Well, we need to walk the horses anyway after that, to let them cool down.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin held back from telling her she did not know as much of Aiel as she thought she did. He could see the city walls behind them, and the Stone rearing above like a mountain. He could even make out the sinuous shape on the banner waving over the fortress, and the displaced birds swirling about; neither of the others could have. It was no difficulty at all to see three people running toward them in long, ground-eating strides, their flowing ease belying the pace. He did not think he could have run that fast, not for long, but the Aiel had to have maintained their speed from the Stone to be this close behind.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We’ll not have to wait that long,” he said.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Faile frowned back toward the city. “Is that them? Are you certain?” Abruptly the frown shifted to him for a moment, daring him to answer. Asking him had been too much like admitting he was part of her party, of course. “He is very boastful of his eyesight,” she told Loial, “but his memory is not very good. At times I think he would forget to light a candle at night if I did not remind him. I expect he’s seen some poor family running from what they think is an earthquake, don’t you?”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Loial shifted uncomfortably in his saddle, sighing heavily, and muttered something about humans that Perrin doubted was complimentary. Faile did not notice, of course.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Not too many minutes later, Faile stared at Perrin as the three Aiel drew close enough for her to make out, but she said nothing. In this mood, she was not about to admit he had been right about anything, not if he said the sky was blue. The Aiel were not even breathing hard when they slowed to a halt beside the horses.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It is too bad it was not a longer run.” Bain shared a smile with Chiad, and both gave Gaul a sly look.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Else we could have run this Stone Dog into the ground,” Chiad said as if finishing the other woman’s sentence. “That is why Stone Dogs take their vows not to retreat. Stone bones and stone heads make them too heavy to run.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Gaul took no offense, though Perrin noticed he stood where he could keep an eye on Chiad. “Do you know why Maidens are so often used as scouts, Perrin? Because they can run so far. And that comes from being afraid some man might want to marry them. A Maiden will run a hundred miles to avoid that.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Very wise of them,” Faile said tartly. “Do you need to rest?” she asked the Aiel women, and looked surprised when they denied it. She turned to Loial anyway. “Are you ready to go on? Good. Find me this Waygate, Loial. We have stayed here too long. If you let a stray puppy stay close to you, it begins to think you will take care of it, and that will never do.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Faile,” Loial protested, “are you not carrying this too far?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I will carry it as far as I must, Loial. The Waygate?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Ears sagging, Loial puffed out a heavy breath and turned his horse eastward again. Perrin let him and Faile get a dozen paces ahead before he and Gaul followed. He must play by her rules, but he would play them at least as well as she.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The farms, cramped little places with rough stone houses Perrin would not have used to shelter animals, grew more scattered the farther east they rode, and the thickets smaller, until there were neither farms nor thickets, only a rolling, hilly grassland. Grass as far as the eye could see, unbroken except for patches of bush here and there on a hill.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Horses dotted the green slopes, too, in clumps of a dozen or herds of a hundred, the famed Tairen stock. Large or small, each gathering of horses was under the eyes of a shoeless boy or two, mounted bareback. The boys carried long-handled whips that they used to keep the horses together, or
turn them, cracking the whips expertly to turn a stray without ever coming close to the animal’s hide. They kept their charges clear of the strangers, moving them back if necessary, but they watched the passage of this odd company—two humans and an Ogier mounted, plus three of the fierce Aiel that stories said had taken the Stone—with the bold curiosity of the young.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">It was all a pleasing sight to Perrin. He liked horses. Part of the reason he had asked to be apprenticed to Master Luhhan had been the chance to work with horses, not that there were so many as this in Emond’s Field, nor so fine.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Not so Loial. The Ogier began muttering to himself, louder the farther they rode across the grassy hills, until at last he burst out in a deep bass rumble. “Gone! All gone, and for what? Grass. Once this was an Ogier grove. We did no great works here, not to compare with Manetheren, or the city you call Caemlyn, but enough that a grove was planted. Trees of every kind, from every land and place. The Great Trees, towering a hundred spans into the sky. All tended devotedly, to remind my people of the <span class="calibre18">stedding</span> they had left to build things for men. Men think it is the stonework we prize, but that is a trifling thing, learned during the Long Exile, after the Breaking. It is the trees we love. Men thought Manetheren my people’s greatest triumph, but we knew it to be the grove there. Gone, now. Like this. Gone, and it will not come again.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Loial stared at the hills, bare save for grass and horses, with a hard face, his ears drawn back tight to his head. He smelled of . . . fury. Peaceful, most stories called Ogier, almost as pacific as the Traveling People, but some, a few, named them implacable enemies. Perrin had only seen Loial angry once before. Perhaps he had been angry last night, defending those children. Looking at Loial’s face, an old saying came back to him. “To anger the Ogier and pull the mountains down on your head.” Everyone took its meaning as to try to do something that was impossible. Perrin thought maybe the meaning had changed with the years. Maybe in the beginning, it had been “Anger the Ogier, and you pull the mountains down on your head.” Difficult to do, but deadly if accomplished. He did not think he would ever want Loial—gentle, fumbling Loial with his broad nose always in a book—to become angry with him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">It was Loial who took the lead once they reached the site of the vanished Ogier grove, bending their path a little southward. There were no landmarks, but he was sure of his direction, surer with every pace of the horses. Ogier could feel a Waygate, sense it somehow, find it as certainly as
a bee could find the hive. When Loial finally dismounted, the grass was little more than knee-high on him. There was only a thick clump of brush to be seen, taller than most, leafy shrubs as tall as the Ogier. He ripped it all away almost regretfully, stacking it to one side. “Perhaps the boys with the horses can use it for firewood when it dries.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">And there was the Waygate.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rearing against the side of the hill, it appeared more a length of gray wall than a gate, and the wall of a palace at that, thickly carved in leaves and vines so finely done that they seemed almost as alive as the bushes had been. Three thousand years at least it had stood there, but not a trace of weathering marred its surface. Those leaves could have rippled with the next breeze.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">For a moment they all stared at it silently, until Loial took a deep breath and put his hand on the one leaf that was different from any other on the Waygate. The trefoil leaf of <span class="calibre18">Avendesora</span>, the fabled Tree of Life. Until the moment his huge hand touched it, it seemed as much a part of the carving as all the rest, but it came away easily.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Faile gasped loudly, and even the Aiel murmured. The air was full of the smell of unease; there was no saying who it came from. All of them, perhaps.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The stone leaves did seem to stir from an unfelt breeze now; they took a tinge of green, of life. Slowly a split appeared down the middle, and the halves of the Waygate opened out, revealing not the hill behind, but a dull shimmering that faintly reflected their images.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Once, it is said,” Loial murmured, “the Waygates shone like mirrors, and those who walked the Ways walked through the sun and the sky. Gone, now. Like this grove.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Hastily pulling one of the filled pole-lanterns from his packhorse, Perrin got it alight. “It is too hot out here,” he said. “A little shade would be good.” He booted Stepper toward the Waygate. He thought he heard Faile gasp again.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The dun stallion balked, approaching his own dim reflection, but Perrin heeled him onward. Slowly, he remembered. It should be done slowly. The horse’s nose touched its image hesitantly, then merged in as though walking into a mirror. Perrin moved closer to himself, touched . . . . Icy cold slid along his skin, enveloping him hair by hair; time stretched out.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The cold vanished like a pricked bubble, and he was in the midst of endless blackness, the light of his pole-lantern a crushed pool around him. Stepper and the packhorse whickered nervously.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Gaul stepped through calmly and began preparing another lantern. Behind him was what seemed like a sheet of smoked glass. The others were visible out there, Loial getting back on his horse, Faile gathering her reins, all of them creeping, barely moving. Time was different inside the Ways.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Faile is upset with you,” Gaul said once he had his lantern alight. It did not add much illumination. The darkness drank in light, swallowed it. “She seems to think you have broken some sort of agreement. Bain and Chiad . . . . Do not let them get you alone. They mean to teach you a lesson, for Faile’s sake, and you will not sit on that animal so easily if they manage what they plan.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I agreed to nothing, Gaul. I do what she’s forced me to do through trickery. We will have to follow Loial as she wants soon enough, but I mean to take the lead for as long as I can.” He pointed to a thick white line under Stepper’s hooves. Broken and heavily pitted, it led off ahead, vanishing in the blackness only a few feet away. “That leads to the first guidepost. We will need to wait there for Loial to read it and decide which bridge to take, but Faile can follow us that far.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Bridge,” Gaul murmured thoughtfully. “I know that word. There is water in here?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“No. It isn’t exactly that kind of bridge. They look the same, sort of, but . . . . Maybe Loial can explain it.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Aielman scratched his head. “Do you know what you are doing, Perrin?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“No,” Perrin admitted, “but there’s no reason for Faile to know that.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Gaul laughed. “It is fun to be so young, is it not, Perrin?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Frowning, uncertain whether the man was laughing at him, Perrin heeled Stepper on, drawing the packhorse behind. The lantern light would not be visible at all in here twenty or thirty paces from its edge. He wanted to be completely out of sight before Faile came through. Let her think he had decided to go on without her. If she worried for a few minutes, until she found him at the guidepost, it was the least she deserved.</span></div>
