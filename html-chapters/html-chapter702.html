<p class="chapterOpenerText">Mat tugged on a sturdy brown coat. The buttons were brass, but other than that, it was free of ornamentation. Made of a thick wool, it had a few holes from arrows that really should have killed him. One of the holes had a bloodstain around it, but that had mostly been washed out. It was a nice coat. He would have paid good coin for a coat like this one, when he lived back in the Two Rivers.</p>
<p class="para">He rubbed his face, looking in the mirror of his new tent. He had shaved off that bloody beard, finally. How did Perrin manage that bloody itching? The man must have sandpaper for skin. Well, Mat would find another way to disguise himself, when needed.</p>
<p class="para">He had nicked himself a few times while shaving. But it was not as if he had forgotten how to take care of himself. He did not need a manservant to do what he could manage on his own. Nodding to himself, he pulled on his hat and grabbed his <span class="italic1">ashandarei</span> from the corner of the tent; the ravens on the blade seemed to perch excitedly in anticipation of battles to come. “Bloody right you do,” Mat said, resting the <span class="italic1">ashandarei</span> on his shoulder as he walked out of the tent. He grabbed his pack and slung it over his other shoulder. Starting tonight, he would be spending nights in the city.</p>
<p class="para">He strode through camp, nodding to a group of passing Redarms. He had doubled the watch. He was worried about the <span class="italic1">gholam</span>, but also about the many military camps in the area. Half were mercenaries, half were the retainers of this minor lord or that, coming to pay respects to the Queen—suspiciously arriving <span class="italic1">after</span> the fighting was done.</p>
<p class="para">No doubt each and every one was professing his heartfelt allegiance to Elayne, explaining that his men supported her all along. Their words probably fell a little flat, since Mat had it on good authority from three separate drunks in taverns that Elayne had used Traveling extensively in recruiting her defense. It was easier to feign a delayed arrival when you were responding to a written message.</p>
<p class="para">“Mat! Mat!”</p>
<p class="para">Mat stopped on the pathway outside his tent as Olver came racing up. The boy had taken to wearing a red band around his arm, much as the Redarms did, but he still wore his brown trousers and coat. He was carrying his rolled-up cloth for Snakes and Foxes under one arm and a pack slung over the other.</p>
<p class="para">Setalle stood in the near distance, along with Lussin and Edder, two Redarms that Mat had assigned to watch over her and the boy. They’d be departing for the city soon.</p>
<p class="para">“Mat,” Olver said, panting. “You’re leaving?”</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t have time to play with you now, Olver,” Mat said, lowering his <span class="italic1">ashandarei</span> to the crook of his arm. “I have to go meet with a Queen.”</p>
<p class="para">“I know,” Olver said. “I figured that since we’re both going to town, we could ride together and plan. I have some ideas about how to defeat the snakes and the foxes! We’re going to show them, Mat. Burn me, but we bloody will!”</p>
<p class="para">“Who taught you that language?”</p>
<p class="para">“Mat,” he said. “This is important! We have to plan! We haven’t <span class="italic1">talked</span> about what we’re going to do.”</p>
<p class="para">Silently, Mat cursed himself for discussing the quest to rescue Moiraine where Olver could hear. The boy was not going to take it well when he was left behind.</p>
<p class="para">“I need to think about what I’m going to say to the Queen,” Mat said, rubbing his chin. “But I guess you’re right, planning is important. Why don’t you go tell Noal about your ideas?”</p>
<p class="para">“I already did,” Olver said. “And Thom too. And Talmanes.”</p>
<p class="para">Talmanes? He was not going with them into the Tower! Light, how much had Olver been spreading the news around?</p>
<p class="para">“Olver,” Mat said, squatting down to be on eye level with the boy, “you need to keep quieter. We don’t want too many people knowing what we’re doing.”</p>
<p class="para">“I didn’t tell nobody we don’t trust, Mat,” Olver said. “Don’t worry. Most were Redarms.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Great,</span> Mat thought. What would the soldiers think of their commander planning to go off and fight a bunch of creatures from children’s stories? Hopefully they would see Olver’s comments as the fancies of a young boy.</p>
<p class="para">“Just be careful,” Mat said. “I’ll come stop by your inn tomorrow, and we can play a game then and talk about it. All right?”</p>
<p class="para">Olver nodded. “All right, Mat. But…blood and bloody ashes!” He turned and walked away.</p>
<p class="para">“And stop swearing!” Mat called after him, then shook his head. Bloody soldiers would have Olver corrupted by the time he was twelve.</p>
<p class="para">Mat continued on his way, leaning his spear on his shoulder again. He found Thom and Talmanes mounted at the front of the camp along with a force of fifty Redarms. Thom wore an extravagant wine-red coat and trousers, gold work at the arms, with a shirt bearing white lace at the cuffs and a silken cravat tied at the neck. The buttons were of gleaming gold. His mustaches had been trimmed and neatly combed. The entire outfit was new, including the black cloak, its inner lining of gold.</p>
<p class="para">Mat froze in place. How had the man so perfectly transformed from an old scamp of a gleeman into a royal courtier? Light!</p>
<p class="para">“I see from your reaction that the presentation is effective,” Thom said.</p>
<p class="para">“Blood and bloody ashes!” Mat exclaimed. “What happened? Did you take ill from a bad sausage at breakfast?”</p>
<p class="para">Thom whipped his cloak back, revealing that he had his harp out and at his side. He looked like a court-bard! “I figured that if—after all of these years—I was going to make an appearance in Caemlyn, I should look the part.”</p>
<p class="para">“No wonder you’ve been singing for coin every day,” Mat said. “The people in those taverns have way too much money.”</p>
<p class="para">Talmanes raised an eyebrow—as good as a grin, from that man. At times, he seemed so dour as to make thunderclouds feel cheerful. He also wore a fine outfit, his of deep cobalt and silver. Mat felt at his cuffs. He could have used some lace. If Lopin had been here, he would have set out the proper outfit without Mat even asking. A little lace was good for a man. Made him look presentable.</p>
<p class="para">“Is <span class="italic1">that</span> what you’re wearing to visit the Queen, Mat?” Talmanes asked.</p>
<p class="para">“Of course it is.” The words left his mouth before he had a chance to think about them. “It’s a good coat.” He walked over to take Pips’ reins.</p>
<p class="para">“Good for sparring in, maybe,” Talmanes said.</p>
<p class="para">“Elayne is the Queen of Andor now, Mat,” Thom said. “And queens are a particular lot. You should show her respect.”</p>
<p class="para">“I <span class="italic1">am</span> showing her bloody respect,” Mat said, handing his spear to one of the soldiers, then climbing into the saddle. He took the spear back, then turned Pips so he could regard Thom. “This is a good enough coat for a farmer.”</p>
<p class="para">“You’re not a farmer anymore, Mat,” Talmanes said.</p>
<p class="para">“I am too,” Mat said stubbornly.</p>
<p class="para">“But Musenge called you—” Thom began.</p>
<p class="para">“He was mistaken,” Mat said. “Just because a man marries someone doesn’t mean he suddenly becomes bloody nobility.”</p>
<p class="para">Thom and Talmanes exchanged a look.</p>
<p class="para">“Mat,” Thom said. “That’s actually <span class="italic1">exactly</span> how it works. It’s pretty much one of the only ways to become nobility.”</p>
<p class="para">“That’s the way we do it here, maybe,” Mat said. “But Tuon is from Seanchan. Who knows what they do there? We all know how strange they can be. We can’t know anything until we talk to her.”</p>
<p class="para">Thom frowned. “I’m certain, from things she said, that—”</p>
<p class="para">“We <span class="italic1">can’t</span> know anything until we talk to Tuon,” Mat repeated, louder this time. “Until then, I’m Mat. None of this Prince of Whatever nonsense.”</p>
<p class="para">Thom looked confused, but Talmanes’ lips turned ever so slightly up at the side. Burn that man. Mat was inclined to think his solemn nature was all an act. Was he secretly laughing inside?</p>
<p class="para">“Well, Mat,” Talmanes said, “you <span class="italic1">never</span> have made any sense, so why should we expect you to now? Onward, then, to meet the Queen of Andor. Certain you don’t want to roll in the mud first?”</p>
<p class="para">“I’ll be fine,” Mat said dryly, pulling his hat down as a soldier tied his pack to the back of his saddle.</p>
<p class="para">He kicked Pips into motion, and the procession began the now-familiar ride to Caemlyn. Mat spent most of the time going over his plan in his head. He had Aludra’s papers tucked into a leather folder, and they included her demands. Every bellfounder in Caemlyn, large quantities of bronze and iron, and powders worth thousands of crowns. And she claimed that was the <span class="italic1">minimum</span> of what she needed.</p>
<p class="para">How under the Light was Mat going to get bloody Elayne Trakand to give him all that? He would have to do a lot of smiling. But Elayne had proven resistant to his smiles before, and Queens were not like ordinary folk. Most women, they would smile back or they would scowl at you, so you knew where you stood. Elayne seemed the type to smile at you, then toss you in prison all the same.</p>
<p class="para">For once, it would be nice if his luck could see him off somewhere enjoying a pipe and a game of dice, with a pretty serving girl on his knee and no cares beyond his next throw. Instead, he was married to a Seanchan High Blood and was off to beg the Queen of Andor for her help. How did he get into these situations? Sometimes he thought that the Creator must be like Talmanes. Straight of face, but secretly having a grand time laughing at Mat.</p>
<p class="para">His procession passed numerous camps on the open plains around Caemlyn. All mercenaries were required to stay at least a league away, but the forces of the lords could camp closer. That put Mat in a rough place. There was always tension between sell-swords and loyal armsmen, and with the mercenaries so far from Caemlyn, fights were common. The Band was right in the middle of it.</p>
<p class="para">He did some quick figuring based on the trails of campfire smoke he saw twisting into the air. There were at least ten thousand mercenaries in the area. Did Elayne know what a bubbling kettle she was brewing here? Too much heat, and the whole bloody thing would boil over!</p>
<p class="para">Mat’s procession drew attention. He had one of the men flying the banner of the Band of the Red Hand, and his men were developing a reputation. By Mat’s count, they were the largest single group—mercenary or lord’s force—outside Caemlyn’s walls. They were as organized and disciplined as a regular army, and were under the leadership of a personal friend of the Dragon Reborn. His men could not help bragging about that, though Mat would much rather that they had kept quiet.</p>
<p class="para">They passed groups of men waiting by the side of the road, curious to catch a glimpse of “Lord Mat.” He kept his eyes forward. If they had expected some fop in a rich coat, then they would be disappointed! Though perhaps he could have chosen a better coat. This one was stiff, and the collar itched.</p>
<p class="para">Of course, more than a few seemed to think Talmanes was “Lord Mat” from the way they pointed, probably because of how he was dressed. Bloody ashes!</p>
<p class="para">This conversation with Elayne was going to be tough. But Mat had a hidden card, one he hoped would be enough to get her to look past the expense of Aludra’s proposal. Though he was more afraid she would see what he was doing and want to take part in it. And when a woman wanted to be “part” of something, that meant she wanted to be in charge.</p>
<p class="para">They approached the gate in Caemlyn’s white-gray walls, passing the growing outer city. The soldiers waved him on. Mat gave them a tip of the hat, and Thom gave a flourishing wave to the small crowd gathered here. They cheered. Great. Just bloody great.</p>
<p class="para">The march through the New City was uneventful save for <span class="italic1">more</span> crowds watching. Would someone recognize his face from those drawings? Mat wanted to get off the main thoroughfares, but Caemlyn’s narrow streets were a twisting mess. A force of fifty horsemen was too large to move through those streets.</p>
<p class="para">They eventually passed through the brilliant white walls of the Inner City, where the roads were wider, the Ogier-built buildings less cramped, and the population thinner. Here, they passed more groups of armed men, including Guardsmen in white and red. Mat could make their camp out ahead, covering the gray paving stones of the courtyard with their tents and horselines.</p>
<p class="para">The Caemlyn palace was like another little city within the city inside the city. It had a low fortified wall, and while its peaks and spires rose into the air, it had more of the look of a war bunker than the Sun Palace did. Odd, how he had never noticed that when he was younger. If Caemlyn fell, this palace could hold on its own. They needed more barracks, though, within that wall. This camping out in the courtyard was ridiculous.</p>
<p class="para">Mat took Talmanes, Thom and a force of ten Redarms as an escort. A tall man in a burnished breastplate, three golden knots on the shoulder of his cloak, waited at the palace entrance. He was a young man, but the way he stood—relaxed, yet poised, hand on the pommel of his sword—indicated he was a practiced soldier. Too bad he had such a pretty face. A life in the military would probably end up wrecking that.</p>
<p class="para">The man nodded to Mat, Thom and Talmanes. “Lord Cauthon?” he asked Mat.</p>
<p class="para">“Just Mat.”</p>
<p class="para">The man raised an eyebrow, but said nothing. “My name is Charlz Guybon. I’ll lead you to Her Majesty.”</p>
<p class="para">She had sent Guybon himself to escort Mat. He was high-ranking, second-in-command of the armies. That was unexpected. Was Elayne afraid of him, or was she was honoring him? Maybe Guybon had wanted to see Mat for himself. She would not honor Mat, not after making him wait so long to get an audience! A fine greeting for an old friend. His suspicions were confirmed when Guybon did not lead them to the Grand Hall, but down to a quiet area of the Palace.</p>
<p class="para">“I’ve heard much about you, Master Cauthon,” Guybon said. He seemed like one of those stiff soldiers. Solid, but maybe a little too solid. Like a bow without enough spring to it.</p>
<p class="para">“From who?” Mat asked. “Elayne?”</p>
<p class="para">“Mostly rumors around the city. People like to talk about you.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">They do?</span> Mat thought. “I didn’t do half of what they say,” he grumbled, “and the other half wasn’t my bloody fault.”</p>
<p class="para">Guybon laughed. “What of the story of you hanging from a tree for nine days?”</p>
<p class="para">“Didn’t happen,” Mat said, resisting the urge to tug at the scarf around his neck. Nine days? Where did that come from? He had not even hung for nine bloody minutes! Nine <span class="italic1">seconds</span> had been too long.</p>
<p class="para">“They also say,” Guybon continued, “that you never lose at dice or at love, and that your spear never misses its target.”</p>
<p class="para">“Wish those second two were true. Burn me, but I wish they were.”</p>
<p class="para">“But you <span class="italic1">do</span> always win at dice?”</p>
<p class="para">“Near enough,” Mat said, tugging down the brim of his hat. “But don’t spread that one, or I’ll never find a game.”</p>
<p class="para">“They say you slew one of the Forsaken,” Guybon noted.</p>
<p class="para">“Not true,” Mat said. Where had <span class="italic1">that</span> one come from?</p>
<p class="para">“And the stories of you dueling the King of the Aiel invaders in a battle of honor? Did you really win the Dragon Reborn the loyalty of the Aiel?”</p>
<p class="para">“Bloody ashes,” Mat said. “I killed Couladin, but it didn’t happen in any kind of duel! I ran into him on the battlefield, and one of us had to die. It wasn’t bloody well going to be me.”</p>
<p class="para">“Interesting,” Guybon said. “I thought that one might be true. At least, it’s one of the few that <span class="italic1">could</span> have happened. Unlike….” He trailed off.</p>
<p class="para">“What?” Mat said. They passed an intersection of halls where servants grouped, watching him and the others pass and whispering among themselves.</p>
<p class="para">Guybon looked hesitant. “I’m sure you’ve heard.”</p>
<p class="para">“Doubtful.” Burn him! What was next? Had the members of the Band been spreading these rumors? Even they did not know about some of those things!</p>
<p class="para">“Well, there’s this rumor that says you stepped into death’s domain to challenge him and demand answers to your questions,” Guybon said, looking more embarrassed. “And that he gave you that spear you hold and foretold to you your own death.”</p>
<p class="para">Mat felt a chill. That one was close enough to the truth to be frightening.</p>
<p class="para">“Silly, I know,” Guybon said.</p>
<p class="para">“Sure,” Mat said. “Silly.” He tried to laugh, but it came out as a cough. Guybon regarded him curiously.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Light,</span> Mat realized, <span class="italic1">he thinks I’m dodging the question!</span> “Only rumors, of course,” Mat said quickly. Too quickly, maybe. Blood and bloody ashes!</p>
<p class="para">Guybon nodded, looking thoughtful.</p>
<p class="para">Mat wanted to change the topic, but he did not trust himself to open his bloody mouth. He could see that more and more palace servants had stopped to watch the procession. He felt like cursing some more at that, but then noticed that many of them seemed focused on Thom.</p>
<p class="para">Thom had been court-bard right here in Caemlyn. He did not talk about it, but Mat knew he had suffered a falling-out with the Queen. Thom had been in virtual exile ever since, coming to Caemlyn only when pressed.</p>
<p class="para">Morgase was dead now, so this was Thom returning from his exile, it seemed. That was probably why he had dressed so finely. Mat looked down at his coat again. <span class="italic1">Burn me, I</span> should <span class="italic1">have worn something nicer.</span></p>
<p class="para">Guybon led them to a carved wooden door, bearing the roaring Lion of Andor. He knocked softly, received the call to enter, then gestured Mat toward the door. “The Queen will receive you in her sitting room.”</p>
<p class="para">“Thom, you’re with me,” Mat said. “Talmanes, you watch the soldiers.” The nobleman looked crestfallen, but Elayne was undoubtedly going to embarrass Mat, and he did not want Talmanes there to see. “I’ll introduce you later,” Mat promised. Bloody noblemen. They thought every second thing was an affront to their honor. Mat would have been <span class="italic1">happy</span> to wait outside!</p>
<p class="para">Mat stepped up to the door, taking a deep breath. He had fought in dozens of skirmishes and battles without growing nervous. Now his hands were shaking. Why did he feel as if he were walking directly into an ambush without a scrap of armor on?</p>
<p class="para">Elayne. As Queen. Burn him, but this was going to hurt. He opened the door and strode in.</p>
<p class="para">His eyes found Elayne immediately. She sat beside a hearth, holding a cup of what appeared to be milk. She looked radiant in a gown of deep red and gold. Beautiful, full red lips that Mat would not have minded kissing, if he had not been a married man. Her red-gold hair seemed to shimmer in the hearthlight, and her cheeks were full of color. She seemed to have gained a little weight. Best not to mention that. Or should he? Sometimes women got angry when you mentioned that they looked different, and sometimes they got angry if you did not notice.</p>
<p class="para">She was a pretty thing. Not as pretty as Tuon, of course. Elayne was far too pale, and too tall, and had too much hair. It was distracting. Still, she was pretty. Seemed a waste as a queen. She would have made an excellent serving girl. Ah well. <span class="italic1">Somebody</span> had to be Queen.</p>
<p class="para">Mat glanced at Birgitte, who was the only other one in the room. <span class="italic1">She</span> looked the same. Always did, with that golden braid and high boots, like the hero from the bloody stories. Which was exactly what she was. It was good to see her again; she was one woman he knew who would not snap at him for speaking the truth.</p>
<p class="para">Thom stepped in beside him, and Mat cleared his throat. She would expect him to be formal. Well, he was not going to bow or scrape, and he—</p>
<p class="para">Elayne leaped out of her chair. She ran across the room as Birgitte closed the door. “Thom, I’m so glad that you’re all right!” Elayne grabbed him in an embrace.</p>
<p class="para">“Hello, dear one,” Thom said fondly. “I hear you’ve done well for yourself, and for Andor.”</p>
<p class="para">Elayne was crying! Mat pulled off his hat, befuddled. Sure, Thom and Elayne had been close, but Elayne was Queen now. Elayne turned toward Mat. “It’s good to see you, Mat. Do not think that the Crown has forgotten your service to me. Bringing Thom back to Andor is another debt we owe you.”</p>
<p class="para">“Well, um,” Mat said. “It really wasn’t anything, you know, Elayne. Burn me. You’re Queen! How’s that feel?”</p>
<p class="para">Elayne laughed, finally releasing Thom. “Such a way with words you have, Mat.”</p>
<p class="para">“I’m not going to bow to you or anything,” he warned. “Or bother with that ‘Your Majesty’ nonsense.”</p>
<p class="para">“I wouldn’t expect it,” Elayne said. “Unless we’re in public, of course. I mean, I have to keep up appearances for the people.”</p>
<p class="para">“I suppose that’s true,” Mat agreed. It did make sense. He held out a hand to Birgitte, but she chuckled and gave him a hug, slapping him on the back like an old pal meeting for a mug of ale. And, well, perhaps that was what they were. Without the ale.</p>
<p class="para">He could have used some ale.</p>
<p class="para">“Come, sit,” Elayne said, gesturing toward the chairs by the fire. “I’m sorry to make you wait so long, Mat.”</p>
<p class="para">“It’s nothing,” he said. “You’re busy.”</p>
<p class="para">“It’s embarrassing,” she said. “One of my stewards lumped you with the mercenary groups. It’s so hard to keep track of them all! If you wish, I’ll give you leave to camp closer to the city. There’s not room inside the walls for the Band, I’m afraid.”</p>
<p class="para">“That won’t be needed,” Mat said, taking one of the seats. “Letting us move closer is kind enough. Thank you.” Thom sat, and Birgitte preferred to stand, though she did join them by the hearth, leaning back against the stones.</p>
<p class="para">“You look well, Elayne,” Thom said. “Is everything going well with the child?”</p>
<p class="para">“Children,” Elayne corrected. “There will be twins. And yes, everything is well. Save for me having to be poked and prodded at nearly every opportunity.”</p>
<p class="para">“Wait,” Mat said. “<span class="italic1">What?</span>” He glanced again at Elayne’s stomach.</p>
<p class="para">Thom rolled his eyes. “Don’t you ever <span class="italic1">listen</span> when you’re in the city gambling?”</p>
<p class="para">“I listen,” Mat muttered. “Usually.” He looked accusingly at Elayne. “Does Rand know about this?”</p>
<p class="para">She laughed. “I should hope he isn’t too surprised.”</p>
<p class="para">“Burn me!” Mat said. “He’s the father!”</p>
<p class="para">“The father of my children is a matter of some speculation in the city,” Elayne said solemnly. “And the Crown prefers there to <span class="italic1">be</span> speculation, for the time. But enough about me! Thom, you have to tell me everything. How did you escape Ebou Dar?”</p>
<p class="para">“Forget Ebou Dar,” Birgitte snapped. “How’s Olver? Did you find him?”</p>
<p class="para">“We did,” Thom said. “And he is well, though I fear the lad is destined for life as a professional soldier.”</p>
<p class="para">“Not a bad life,” Birgitte said. “Eh, Mat?”</p>
<p class="para">“There are worse,” he said, still trying to get his legs underneath him. How had becoming Queen made Elayne <span class="italic1">less</span> high-and-mighty? Had he missed something? She actually seemed agreeable now!</p>
<p class="para">Well, that was unfair. There were times when she had been agreeable before. They had merely been mixed between times when she had been ordering Mat around. He found himself smiling as Thom related the details of their escape and the capture of Tuon, followed by their travels with Master Luca’s menagerie. Drawn from the quiver of a storyteller, the tale sounded a whole lot more impressive than it had been to live. Mat almost thought himself a hero, listening to Thom.</p>
<p class="para">Right before Thom got to the part about Tuon’s marriage words, however, Mat coughed and cut in. “And we beat the Seanchan, fled into Murandy, and eventually found an Aes Sedai to get us here through a gateway. By the way, have you seen Verin lately?”</p>
<p class="para">“No,” Elayne said. Thom eyed Mat with amusement.</p>
<p class="para">“Blast,” Mat said. Well, there went his chance to use her for a gateway to the Tower of Ghenjei. He would worry about that later. He took the leather envelope from his belt, then opened it, taking out Aludra’s papers. “Elayne,” he said, “I need to talk to you.”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, you mentioned ‘bellfounders’ in your letter. What trouble have you gotten yourself into, Matrim Cauthon?”</p>
<p class="para">“That’s not fair at all,” he said, spreading out the sheets. “I’m not the one who gets into trouble. If I—”</p>
<p class="para">“You’re <span class="italic1">not</span> going to mention my getting captured in the Stone of Tear again, are you?” she asked with a roll of her eyes.</p>
<p class="para">He stopped. “Of course not. That happened ages ago. I barely remember it.”</p>
<p class="para">She laughed, the pretty sound ringing in the room. He felt himself blushing. “Anyway, I’m not in trouble. I just need some resources.”</p>
<p class="para">“What kind of resources?” Elayne asked, growing curious as he spread out the papers on the table next to her chair. Birgitte leaned down.</p>
<p class="para">“Well,” Mat said, rubbing his chin. “There are three bellfounders in the city; I’ll need those. And we’re going to need some powders. They’re listed on this page. And…we’ll need a little bit of metal.” He winced and handed her one of Aludra’s lists.</p>
<p class="para">Elayne read the page, then blinked. “Are you mad?”</p>
<p class="para">“Sometimes I think I might be,” he said. “But burn me, I think this will be worth the cost.”</p>
<p class="para">“What is it?” Elayne asked as Birgitte looked over one of the sheets, then handed it to Elayne.</p>
<p class="para">“Aludra calls them dragons,” Mat said. “Thom says you knew her?”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, I did,” Elayne said.</p>
<p class="para">“Well, these are launching tubes, like the ones for her fireworks. Only they’re made of metal, and they’re big. And instead of launching nightflowers, they launch these head-sized chunks of iron.”</p>
<p class="para">“Why would you want to launch chunks of iron up into the air?” Elayne said, frown deepening.</p>
<p class="para">“You <span class="italic1">don’t</span>,” Birgitte said, eyes opening wide. “You launch them at someone else’s army.”</p>
<p class="para">Mat nodded. “Aludra claims that one of these dragons could launch an iron ball as far as a mile.”</p>
<p class="para">“Mother’s milk in a cup!” Birgitte said. “You can’t be serious.”</p>
<p class="para">“She is,” Mat said. “And I believe her. You should see what she’s created already, and she claims these will be her masterpiece. Look, she shows here the dragons firing on a city wall from a mile away. With fifty dragons and two hundred and fifty soldiers she could knock down a wall like the one around Caemlyn in a few hours.”</p>
<p class="para">Elayne looked pale. Did she believe him? Would she be angry at him for wasting her time?</p>
<p class="para">“I know that won’t be of much use in the Last Battle,” Mat said quickly. “Trollocs don’t have walls. But look here. I had her design a spreading shot. Fire it on a line of Trollocs from four hundred paces, and one of these dragons will do the work of fifty bowmen. Burn me, Elayne, but we’re going to be at a disadvantage. The Shadow can <span class="italic1">always</span> toss more Trollocs at us than we have soldiers, and the bloody things are twice as hard to kill as a man. We need an advantage. I remember—”</p>
<p class="para">He cut himself off. He had been about to say he remembered the Trolloc Wars, which would not have been a good idea. A man could start some embarrassing rumors that way. “Look,” he said. “I know this sounds outrageous, but you have to give it a chance.”</p>
<p class="para">She looked up at him, and…was she crying again? What had he done?</p>
<p class="para">“Mat, I could kiss you,” she declared. “This is exactly what I needed!”</p>
<p class="para">Mat blinked. What?</p>
<p class="para">Birgitte chuckled. “First Norry, now Mat. You’ll have to watch yourself, Elayne. Rand will be jealous.”</p>
<p class="para">Elayne snorted, looking down at the plans. “The bellfounders aren’t going to like this. Most of the craftsmen were looking forward to getting back to daily work, following the siege.”</p>
<p class="para">“Oh, I don’t know about that, Elayne,” Birgitte said. “I’ve known a craftsman or two in my time. To a person, they complain about royal privilege during war, but as long as the Crown compensates them, they’re secretly happy. Steady work is always appreciated. Besides, something like this will make them curious.”</p>
<p class="para">“We’ll have to keep it secret,” Elayne said.</p>
<p class="para">“So you’ll do it?” Mat asked, surprised. He had not needed his secret bribe to distract her!</p>
<p class="para">“We’ll need proof of one working first, of course,” Elayne said. “But if these devices, these dragons, work half as well as Aludra claims…well, I’d be a fool not to put every man on them we can!”</p>
<p class="para">“That’s right generous of you,” Mat said, scratching his head.</p>
<p class="para">Elayne hesitated. “Generous?”</p>
<p class="para">“Building these for the Band.”</p>
<p class="para">“For the Band…Mat, these will be for Andor!”</p>
<p class="para">“Here now,” Mat said. “These are <span class="italic1">my</span> plans.”</p>
<p class="para">“And <span class="italic1">my</span> resources!” Elayne said. She sat up straight, suddenly becoming more poised. “Surely you see that the Crown could offer a more stable and useful control for the deployment of these weapons.”</p>
<p class="para">To the side, Thom was grinning.</p>
<p class="para">“What are <span class="italic1">you</span> so happy about?” Mat demanded.</p>
<p class="para">“Nothing,” Thom said. “You do your mother proud, Elayne.”</p>
<p class="para">“Thank you, Thom,” she said, favoring him with a smile.</p>
<p class="para">“Whose side are you on?” Mat said.</p>
<p class="para">“Everyone’s,” Thom said.</p>
<p class="para">“That’s not a bloody side,” Mat said, then looked back to Elayne. “I put a lot of effort and thought into getting these plans out of Aludra. I’ve nothing against Andor, but I don’t trust anyone with these weapons who isn’t me.”</p>
<p class="para">“And if the Band were part of Andor?” Elayne asked. She really <span class="italic1">did</span> sound like a queen all of a sudden.</p>
<p class="para">“The Band is beholden to nobody,” Mat said.</p>
<p class="para">“That is admirable, Mat,” Elayne said, “but it makes you mercenaries. I think that the Band deserves something more, something better. With official backing, you would have access to resources and authority. We could give you a commission in Andor, with your own command structure.”</p>
<p class="para">It was actually tempting. Just a little. But it did not matter. He did not think Elayne would be happy to have him in her realm once she knew of his relationship with the Seanchan. He meant to return to Tuon eventually, somehow. If only to work out what she really felt about him.</p>
<p class="para">He had no intention of giving the Seanchan access to these dragons, but he did not fancy giving them to Andor, either. Unfortunately, he had to admit that there was no way he was going to have Andor build them without giving the weapons to the nation, too.</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t want a commission for the Band,” Mat said. “We’re free men, and that’s how we like it.”</p>
<p class="para">Elayne looked troubled.</p>
<p class="para">“But I’d be willing to split the dragons with you,” Mat said. “Some for us, some for you.”</p>
<p class="para">“What if,” Elayne said, “I built all of the dragons and owned all of them—but promised that only the Band could use them? No other forces would have access to them.”</p>
<p class="para">“That would be kind of you,” Mat said. “Suspicious, though. No offense.”</p>
<p class="para">“It would be better for me if the noble Houses didn’t have these, at least not at first. They will spread eventually. Weapons always do. I build them and promise to give them to the Band. No commission, just a contract, hiring you for a long term. You can go at any time. But if you do, you leave the dragons behind.”</p>
<p class="para">Mat frowned. “Feels like you’re wrapping a chain around my neck, Elayne.”</p>
<p class="para">“I’m only suggesting reasonable solutions.”</p>
<p class="para">“The day you become reasonable is the day I eat my hat,” Mat said. “No offense.”</p>
<p class="para">Elayne raised an eyebrow at him. Yes, she had become a queen. Just like that.</p>
<p class="para">“I want the right to keep a few of these dragons,” Mat said, “if we leave. One-quarter to us, three-quarters to you. But we’ll take your contract, and while we’re in your employ, only we use them. As you said.”</p>
<p class="para">Her frown deepened. Burn him, but she had grasped the power of those dragons quickly. He could not let her hesitate now. They <span class="italic1">needed</span> the dragons to go into production immediately. And he was not about to let the chance of having them pass the Band by.</p>
<p class="para">Sighing to himself, Mat reached up and undid the strap at the back of his neck, then pulled the familiar foxhead medallion out of his shirt. The second he removed it, he felt more naked than if he had stripped bare. He set it on the table.</p>
<p class="para">Elayne glanced at it, and he could see a flash of desire in her eyes. “What is that for?”</p>
<p class="para">“It’s a sweetener,” Mat said, leaning forward, elbows on knees. “You get it for one day if you agree to start production on a prototype dragon this evening. I don’t care what you do with the medallion—study it, write a bloody book about it, wear it about. But you return it tomorrow. Your word on it.”</p>
<p class="para">Birgitte whistled slowly. Elayne had wanted to get her hands on that medallion the moment she discovered he had it. Of course, so had every other bloody Aes Sedai that Mat had met.</p>
<p class="para">“I get the Band in at least a one-year contract,” Elayne said, “renewable. We’ll pay you whatever you were earning in Murandy.”</p>
<p class="para">How did she know about that?</p>
<p class="para">“You can cancel,” she continued, “as long as you provide a month’s warning—but I keep four dragons out of five. And any men who wish to join the Andoran military must be given the chance.”</p>
<p class="para">“I want one out of four,” Mat said. “And a new serving man.”</p>
<p class="para">“A <span class="italic1">what</span>?” Elayne said.</p>
<p class="para">“A serving man,” Mat said. “You know, to take care of my clothing. You’d do a better job of picking than I would.”</p>
<p class="para">Elayne looked at his coat, then up at his hair. “That,” she said, “I’ll give you regardless of how the other negotiations go.”</p>
<p class="para">“One out of four?” Mat said.</p>
<p class="para">“I get the medallion for three days.”</p>
<p class="para">He shivered. Three days, with the <span class="italic1">gholam</span> in town. She would have him dead. It was already a gamble to give it to her for a day. But he could not think of anything else he could offer. “What do you even think you can do with the thing?” he asked.</p>
<p class="para">“Copy it,” Elayne said absently, “if I’m lucky.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">“Really?”</span></p>
<p class="para">“I won’t know until I study it.”</p>
<p class="para">Mat suddenly had the horrifying image of every Aes Sedai in the world wearing one of those medallions. He shared a look with Thom, who seemed equally surprised to hear this.</p>
<p class="para">But what did that matter? Mat could not channel. Before, he had worried that—if she studied it—Elayne might figure a way to touch him with the One Power when he was wearing it. But if she just wanted to copy it…well, he found himself relieved. And intrigued.</p>
<p class="para">“There’s been something I’ve been meaning to mention, Elayne,” he said. “The <span class="italic1">gholam</span> is here. In town. It’s been killing people.”</p>
<p class="para">Elayne remained calm, but he could tell from the way she was even more formal when she spoke that the news worried her. “Then I will be certain to return the medallion to you on time.”</p>
<p class="para">He grimaced. “All right,” he said. “Three days.”</p>
<p class="para">“Very well,” she said. “I want the Band to start immediately. I’ll be Traveling to Cairhien soon, and I have a feeling they would be a better support force there than the Queen’s Guards.”</p>
<p class="para">So <span class="italic1">that</span> was what this was about! Elayne was moving on the Sun Throne. Well, that seemed a good use for the men, at least until Mat needed them. Better than letting them sit around getting lazy and picking fights with sell-swords.</p>
<p class="para">“I agree to that,” Mat said, “but Elayne, the Band has to be free to fight in the Last Battle, however Rand wants. And Aludra has to supervise the dragons. I have a feeling that she’ll insist that she remain with you if the Band breaks off from Andor.”</p>
<p class="para">“I have no issues with that,” Elayne said, smiling.</p>
<p class="para">“I figured you wouldn’t. But, just so we’re clear, the Band has control of the dragons until we leave. You can’t sell the technology to others.”</p>
<p class="para">“Someone will replicate it, Mat,” she said.</p>
<p class="para">“Copies won’t be as good as Aludra’s,” Mat said. “I promise you that.”</p>
<p class="para">Elayne studied him, blue eyes weighing him, judging him. “I’d still rather have the Band as a fully commissioned Andoran force.”</p>
<p class="para">“Well, I wish I had a hat made all of gold, a tent that could fly and a horse that leaves droppings of diamonds. But we’ll both have to settle with what’s reasonable, won’t we?”</p>
<p class="para">“It wouldn’t be unreasonable to—”</p>
<p class="para">“We’d have to do what you said, Elayne,” Mat replied. “I won’t have it. Some battles aren’t worth fighting, and I’m going to decide when my men put themselves at risk. That’s that.”</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t like having men who could leave me at any time.”</p>
<p class="para">“You know I won’t hold them back merely to spite you,” Mat said. “I’ll do what’s right.”</p>
<p class="para">“What you <span class="italic1">see</span> as being right,” she corrected.</p>
<p class="para">“Every man should have that option,” he replied.</p>
<p class="para">“Few men use it wisely.”</p>
<p class="para">“We want it anyway,” Mat said. “We demand it.”</p>
<p class="para">She glanced—almost imperceptibly—toward the plans and the medallion on the table. “You have it,” she said.</p>
<p class="para">“Deal,” he said, standing up, spitting in his hand, and holding it out.</p>
<p class="para">She hesitated, stood and spat in her hand, then held it out to him. He smiled and shook it.</p>
<p class="para">“Did you know that I might ask you to take arms against the Two Rivers?” she asked. “Is that why you demanded the right to leave if you want?”</p>
<p class="para">Against the <span class="italic1">Two Rivers</span>? Why under the Light would she want to do that? “You don’t need to fight them, Elayne.”</p>
<p class="para">“We shall see what Perrin forces me to do,” she replied. “But let’s not discuss that right now.” She glanced at Thom, then reached under her table and pulled out a rolled piece of paper with a ribbon about it. “Please. I want to hear more of what happened during your trip out of Ebou Dar. Will you take dinner with me this evening?”</p>
<p class="para">“We’d be delighted,” Thom said, standing. “Wouldn’t we, Mat?”</p>
<p class="para">“I suppose,” Mat said. “If Talmanes can come. He’ll tear my throat out if I don’t at least let him meet you, Elayne. Taking dinner with you will have him dancing all the way back to the camp.”</p>
<p class="para">Elayne chuckled. “As you wish. I’ll have servants show you to some rooms where you can rest until the time arrives.” She handed Thom the rolled-up paper. “This will be proclaimed tomorrow, if you will it.”</p>
<p class="para">“What is it?” Thom asked, frowning.</p>
<p class="para">“The court of Andor lacks a proper court-bard,” she said. “I thought you might be interested.”</p>
<p class="para">Thom hesitated. “You honor me, but I can’t accept that. There are things I need to do in the next little while, and I can’t be tied to the court.”</p>
<p class="para">“You needn’t be tied to the court,” Elayne said. “You’ll have freedom to leave and go where you wish. But when you are in Caemlyn, I’d have you be known for who you are.”</p>
<p class="para">“I…” He took the roll of paper. “I’ll consider it, Elayne.”</p>
<p class="para">“Excellent.” She grimaced. “I’m afraid I have an appointment with my midwife now, but I will see you at dinner. I haven’t yet asked what Matrim meant by calling himself a married man in his letter. I expect a full report! No expurgations!” She eyed Mat, smiling slyly. “Expurgation means ‘parts cut out,’ Mat. In case you weren’t bloody aware.”</p>
<p class="para">He put his hat on. “I knew that.” What had that word been again? Expirations? Light, why had he mentioned his marriage in that letter? He had hoped it would make Elayne curious enough to see him.</p>
<p class="para">Elayne laughed, gesturing them toward the exit. Thom spared a paternal kiss for her cheek before parting—good that it was paternal! Mat had heard some things about those two that he did not want to believe. With Thom old enough to be her grandfather, no less.</p>
<p class="para">Mat pulled open the door, moving to leave.</p>
<p class="para">“And Mat,” Elayne added. “If you need to borrow money to buy a new coat, the Crown can lend you some. Considering your station, you really should dress more nicely.”</p>
<p class="para">“I’m no bloody nobleman!” he said, turning.</p>
<p class="para">“Not yet,” she said. “You don’t have Perrin’s audacity in naming yourself to a title. I’ll see that you get one.”</p>
<p class="para">“You wouldn’t dare,” he said.</p>
<p class="para">“But—”</p>
<p class="para">“See here,” he said as Thom joined him in the hallway. “I’m <span class="italic1">proud</span> of who I am. And I like this coat. It’s comfortable.” He clenched his hands into fists, refusing to scratch at his collar.</p>
<p class="para">“If you say so,” Elayne said. “I will see you at dinner. I’ll have to bring Dyelin. She’s very curious to meet you.”</p>
<p class="para">With that, she had Birgitte close the door. Mat stared at it vengefully for a moment, then turned toward Thom. Talmanes and the soldiers waited a short distance down the hallway, out of hearing range. They were being given warm tea by some palace servants.</p>
<p class="para">“That went well,” Mat decided, hands on hips. “I worried she wouldn’t bite, but I think I reeled her in pretty well.” Though the bloody dice were still rolling in his head.</p>
<p class="para">Thom laughed, clapping him on the shoulder.</p>
<p class="para">“What?” Mat demanded.</p>
<p class="para">Thom just chuckled, then glanced down at the scroll in his other hand. “And this was unexpected as well.”</p>
<p class="para">“Well, Andor <span class="italic1">doesn’t</span> have a court-bard,” Mat said.</p>
<p class="para">“Yes,” Thom said, looking over the scroll. “But there’s a pardon written in here too, for any and all crimes—known and unknown—I may have committed in Andor or Cairhien. I wonder who told her….”</p>
<p class="para">“Told her what?”</p>
<p class="para">“Nothing, Mat. Nothing at all. We have a few hours until dinner with Elayne. What do you say we go buy you a new coat?”</p>
<p class="para">“All right,” Mat said. “You think I could get one of those pardons, too, if I asked for it?”</p>
<p class="para">“Do you need one?”</p>
<p class="para">Mat shrugged, walking down the hallway with him. “Can’t hurt to be safe. What kind of coat are you going to buy me, anyway?”</p>
<p class="para">“I didn’t say <span class="italic1">I’d</span> pay.”</p>
<p class="para">“Don’t be so stingy,” Mat said. “I’ll pay for dinner.” And bloody ashes, somehow, Mat knew, he would.</p>
