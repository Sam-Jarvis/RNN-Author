<p class="ct"><span class="epub-i">The Choice of an Ajah</span></p>
<p class="tni">Pevara did her very best to pretend that she was not terrified.</p>
<p class="tx">If these Asha’man had known her, they’d have realized that sitting still and quiet was not her natural state. She retreated to basic Aes Sedai training: <span class="epub-i1">appearing</span> in control when she felt anything but.</p>
<p class="tx">She forced herself to rise. Canler and Emarin had withdrawn to visit the Two Rivers lads and make sure they were going about in pairs. That left only her and Androl again. He quietly tinkered with his leather straps as the rain continued outside. He used two needles at once to stitch, crossing the holes on either side. The man had the concentration of a master craftsman.</p>
<p class="tx">Pevara strolled over, causing him to look up sharply when she drew close. She smothered a smile. She might not look it, but she could move silently, when necessary.</p>
<p class="tx">She stared out of the windows. The rain had grown worse, splashing curtains of water against the glass. “After so many weeks of <span class="epub-i1">looking</span> as if it would storm at any moment, it finally comes.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Those clouds had to break open eventually,” Androl said.</p>
<p class="tx">“The rain doesn’t feel natural,” she said, hands clasped behind her. She could feel the coldness through the glass. “It doesn’t ebb and flow. Just the same steady torrent. A great deal of lightning, but very little thunder.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You think it’s one of those?” Androl asked. He didn’t need to say what “those” meant. Earlier in the week, common people in the Tower—none of the Asha’man—had begun bursting into flame. Just … flame, inexplicably. They’d lost some forty people. Many still blamed a rogue Asha’man, though the men had sworn nobody had been channeling nearby.</p>
<p class="tx">She shook her head, watching a group of people trudge past on the muddy street outside. She had been one of those, at first, who had called the deaths the work of an Asha’man gone mad. Now she accepted these events, and other oddities, as something far worse.</p>
<p class="tx">The world was unraveling.</p>
<p class="tx">She needed to be strong. Pevara herself had devised the plan of bringing women here to bond these men, though Tarna had suggested it. She couldn’t let them discover how disturbing she found it to be trapped in here, facing down enemies who could force a person to the Shadow. Her only allies men who, only months ago, she would have pursued with diligence and gentled without remorse.</p>
<p class="tx">She sat down on the stool Emarin had used earlier. “I would like to discuss this ‘plan’ you are developing.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m not sure I’ve actually developed one yet, Aes Sedai.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I might be able to offer some suggestions.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I wouldn’t say no to hearing them,” Androl said, though he narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p class="tx">“What’s wrong?” she asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“Those people outside. I don’t recognize them. And…”</p>
<p class="tx">She looked back out the window. The only light came from buildings, shining an occasional red-orange glow into the drenched night. The passersby still moved very slowly down the street, in and out of the light of windows.</p>
<p class="tx">“Their clothing isn’t wet,” Androl whispered.</p>
<p class="tx">With a chill, Pevara realized he was right. The man at the front walked with a wide-brimmed, drooping hat on his head, but it didn’t break the rain or stream water. His rustic clothing was untouched by the downpour. And the dress of the woman beside him wasn’t blowing at all in the wind. Now Pevara saw that one of the younger men was holding his hand behind him, as if pulling the reins of a pack animal—but there was no animal there.</p>
<p class="tx">Pevara and Androl watched in silence until the figures passed too far into the night to be seen. Visions of the dead were growing increasingly common.</p>
<p class="tx">“You said you had a suggestion?” Androl’s voice trembled.</p>
<p class="tx">“I … Yes.” Pevara tore her eyes away from the window. “So far, Taim’s focus has been on the Aes Sedai. My sisters have all been taken. I am the last.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You’re offering yourself as bait.”</p>
<p class="tx">“They <span class="epub-i1">will</span> come for me,” she said. “It is only a matter of time.”</p>
<p class="tx">Androl fingered the leather strap and looked pleased with it. “We should sneak you out.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Is that so?” she said, eyebrow raised. “I have been elevated to the position of maiden in need of rescue, have I? Very valiant of you.”</p>
<p class="tx">He blushed. “Sarcasm? From an Aes Sedai? I wouldn’t have thought I’d hear that.”</p>
<p class="tx">Pevara laughed. “Oh my, Androl. You really don’t know <span class="epub-i1">anything</span> about us, do you?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Honestly? No. I’ve avoided your kind for most of my life.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Well, considering your … innate tendencies, perhaps that was wise.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I couldn’t channel before.”</p>
<p class="tx">“But you suspected. You came here to learn.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I was curious,” he said. “It’s something I hadn’t tried before.”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Interesting,</span> Pevara thought. <span class="epub-i1">Is that what drives you then, leatherworker? What has set you drifting on the winds, from place to place?</span></p>
<p class="tx">“I suspect,” she said, “you have never tried jumping off a cliff before. The fact that you haven’t done something shouldn’t <span class="epub-i1">always</span> be a reason to try it.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Actually, I have jumped off a cliff. Several of them.”</p>
<p class="tx">She raised an eyebrow at him.</p>
<p class="tx">“The Sea Folk do it,” he explained. “Off into the ocean. The braver you are, the higher the cliff you choose. And you have changed the topic of the conversation again, Pevara Sedai. You are quite skilled at that.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Thank you.”</p>
<p class="tx">“The reason,” he said, holding up a finger, “that I suggested we sneak you out is because this isn’t your battle. You shouldn’t have to fall here.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It isn’t because you want to hurry an Aes Sedai away, out of meddling in your business?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I came to you for help,” Androl said. “I don’t want to be rid of you; I’ll happily use you. However, if you fall here, you do so in a fight that is not your own. That isn’t fair.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Let me explain something to you, Asha’man,” Pevara said, leaning in. “This <span class="epub-i1">is</span> my fight. If the Shadow takes this tower, it will mean terrible things for the Last Battle. I have accepted responsibility for you and yours; I will not turn away from it so easily.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You’ve ‘accepted responsibility’ for us? What does that mean?”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Ah, perhaps I shouldn’t have shared that.</span> Still, if they were going to be allies, perhaps he needed to know.</p>
<p class="tx">“The Black Tower needs guidance,” she explained.</p>
<p class="tx">“So that’s the point of bonding us?” Androl asked. “So we can be … corralled, like stallions to be broken?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Don’t be a fool. Surely you admit the value of the White Tower’s experience.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m not sure I’d say that,” Androl said. “With experience comes a determination to be set in your ways, to avoid new experiences. You Aes Sedai all assume that the way things have been done is the only way to do them. Well, the Black Tower will not be subject to you. We can look after ourselves.”</p>
<p class="tx">“And you’ve done a <span class="epub-i1">wonderful</span> job of that so far, haven’t you?”</p>
<p class="tx">“That was unfair,” he said softly.</p>
<p class="tx">“Perhaps it was,” she admitted. “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Your motivations don’t surprise me,” he said. “What you were doing here was obvious to the weakest of soldiers. The question I’ve had is this: Why, of all women, did the White Tower send <span class="epub-i1">Red</span> sisters to bond us?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Who better? Our entire lives have been dedicated to dealing with men who can channel.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Your Ajah is doomed.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Is that so?”</p>
<p class="tx">“You exist to hunt down men who can channel,” he said. “To gentle them. See them … disposed of. Well, the Source is cleansed—”</p>
<p class="tx">“So you all say.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It <span class="epub-i1">is</span> cleansed, Pevara. All things come and pass, and the Wheel turns. It was once pure, so it must someday be pure again. It has happened.”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">And the way you look at shadows, Androl? Is that a sign of purity? The way that Nalaam mutters in unknown languages? Do you think we don’t notice such things?</span></p>
<p class="tx">“You have two choices, as an Ajah,” Androl continued. “You can either continue to hunt us—ignoring the proof that we offer, that the Source is cleansed—or you can give up on being Red Ajah.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Nonsense. Of all Ajahs, the Reds should be your greatest ally.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You exist to destroy us!”</p>
<p class="tx">“We exist to make certain that men who can channel do not accidentally hurt themselves or those around them. Would you not agree that is a purpose of the Black Tower as well?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I suppose that might be part of it. The only purpose I have been told was that we are to be a weapon for the Dragon Reborn, but keeping good men from hurting themselves without proper training is important as well.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Then we can unite on that idea, can we not?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I would like to believe that, Pevara, but I’ve seen the way you and yours look at us. You see us as … as some stain that needs to be cleansed, or poison to be bottled.”</p>
<p class="tx">Pevara shook her head. “If what you say is true, and the Source is cleansed, then changes <span class="epub-i1">will</span> come, Androl. The Red Ajah and the Asha’man will grow together in common purpose, over time. I’m willing to work with you now, here.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Contain us.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Guide you. Please. Trust me.”</p>
<p class="tx">He studied her by the light of the room’s many lamps. He did have a sincere face. She could see why the others followed him, though he was weakest among them. He had a strange mixture of passion and humility. If only he hadn’t been one of … well … what he was.</p>
<p class="tx">“I wish I could believe you,” Androl said, looking away. “You’re different from the others, I’ll admit. Not like a Red at all.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I think you’ll find we’re more varied than you suppose,” Pevara said. “There isn’t one single motive that makes a woman choose the Red.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Other than hatred of men.”</p>
<p class="tx">“If we hated you, would we have come here looking to bond you?” That was a sidestep, in truth. Though Pevara herself did not hate men, many Reds did—at the very least, many regarded men with suspicion. She hoped to change that.</p>
<p class="tx">“Aes Sedai motivations are odd sometimes,” Androl said. “Everyone knows that. Anyway, different though you are from many of your sisters, I’ve seen that look in your eyes.” He shook his head. “I won’t believe you’re here to help us. No more than I believed that the Aes Sedai who hunted down male channelers really thought they were helping the men. No more than I believe a headsman thinks he’s doing a criminal a favor by killing him. Just because a thing needs to be done doesn’t make the one doing it a friend, Pevara Sedai. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="tx">He turned back to his leather, working by the close light of a lantern on the table.</p>
<p class="tx">Pevara found her annoyance rising. She’d almost had him. She <span class="epub-i1">liked</span> men; she had often thought Warders would be useful. Couldn’t the fool recognize a hand extended across the chasm when he saw it?</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Calm yourself, Pevara,</span> she thought. <span class="epub-i1">You won’t get anywhere if anger rules you.</span> She needed this man on her side.</p>
<p class="tx">“That will be a saddle, won’t it?” she said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You’re staggering the stitches.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It’s my own method,” he said. “Helps prevent rips from spreading. I think it looks nice, too.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Good linen thread, I assume? Waxed? And do you use a single lacing chisel for those holes, or a double? I didn’t get a good look.”</p>
<p class="tx">He glanced at her, wary. “You know leatherworking?”</p>
<p class="tx">“From my uncle,” she said. “He taught me a few things. Let me work in the shop, when I was little.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Maybe I’ve met him.”</p>
<p class="tx">She fell still. For all Androl’s comments that she was good at steering a conversation, she had blundered this one directly into places she didn’t like to go.</p>
<p class="tx">“Well?” he asked. “Where?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Back in Kandor.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You’re <span class="epub-i1">Kandori</span>?” he asked, surprised.</p>
<p class="tx">“Of course I am. Don’t I look it?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I just thought I could pick out any accent,” he said, pulling a pair of stitches tight. “I’ve been there. Maybe I do know your uncle.”</p>
<p class="tx">“He’s dead,” she said. “Murdered by Darkfriends.”</p>
<p class="tx">Androl fell silent. “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It’s been over a hundred years now. I miss my family, but they’d be dead by now even if the Darkfriends hadn’t killed them. Everyone I knew back home is dead.”</p>
<p class="tx">“My sorrow is deeper, then. Truly.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It is long past,” Pevara said. “I can remember them with fondness without having the pain intrude. But what of your family? Siblings? Nieces, nephews?”</p>
<p class="tx">“A smattering of each group,” Androl said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Do you ever see them?”</p>
<p class="tx">He eyed her. “You’re trying to engage me in friendly conversation to prove that you don’t feel awkward around me. But I’ve seen how you Aes Sedai look at people like me.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I—”</p>
<p class="tx">“Say you don’t find us repulsive.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I hardly think what you do should be—”</p>
<p class="tx">“Straight answer, Pevara.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Very well, fine. Men who can channel <span class="epub-i1">do</span> discomfort me. You make me itch all over, and it has only grown worse the longer I’ve been here, surrounded by you.”</p>
<p class="tx">Androl nodded in satisfaction at having pulled it from her.</p>
<p class="tx">“However,” Pevara continued, “I feel this way because it has been ingrained in me over decades of life. What you do is terribly unnatural, but you yourself do <span class="epub-i1">not</span> disgust me. You are just a man trying to do your best, and I hardly think that is worthy of disgust. Either way, I am willing to look beyond my inhibitions in the name of common good.”</p>
<p class="tx">“That’s better than I could have expected, I suppose.” He looked back toward the rain-splattered windows. “The taint is cleansed. This isn’t unnatural any longer. I wish … I wish I could just <span class="epub-i1">show</span> you, woman.” He looked toward her sharply. “How does one form one of those circles you mentioned?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Well,” Pevara said, “I’ve never actually done it with a male channeler, of course. I did some reading before coming down here, but much of what we have is hearsay. So much has been lost. To start with, you must put yourself on the edge of embracing the Source, then open yourself to me. That is how we establish the link.”</p>
<p class="tx">“All right,” he said. “You’re not holding the Source, however.”</p>
<p class="tx">It was downright unfair, that a man could tell when a woman was holding the One Power and when she wasn’t. Pevara embraced the Source, flooding herself with the sweet nectar that was <span class="epub-i1">saidar</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">She reached out to link with Androl as she would with a woman. That was how one was supposed to begin, according to the records. But it was not the same. <span class="epub-i1">Saidin</span> was a torrent, and what she had read was true; she could do nothing with the flows.</p>
<p class="tx">“It’s working; my power is flowing into you.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes,” Pevara said. “But when a man and woman link, the man must be in control. You must take the lead.”</p>
<p class="tx">“How?” Androl asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t know. I’ll try to pass it. You <span class="epub-i1">must</span> control the flows.”</p>
<p class="tx">He eyed her, and she prepared herself to pass control to him. Instead, he somehow <span class="epub-i1">seized</span> it. She was caught in the tempestuous link, yanked—as if by her hair—right in.</p>
<p class="tx">The force of it nearly made her teeth rattle, and it felt as if her skin was being pulled off. Pevara closed her eyes, breathed deeply, and did not let herself fight back. She had wanted to try this; it could be useful. But she couldn’t help a moment of sheer panic.</p>
<p class="tx">She was linked with a <span class="epub-i1">male channeler</span>, one of the most feared things the land had ever known. Now he had control of her, completely. Her Power flowed through her, washing over him, and Androl gasped.</p>
<p class="tx">“So much…” he said. “Light, you’re strong.”</p>
<p class="tx">She allowed herself a smile. The link brought with it a storm of awareness. She could feel Androl’s emotions. He was as fearful as she was. He was also <span class="epub-i1">solid</span>. She’d imagined that being linked to him would be terrible, because of his madness, but she sensed none of it.</p>
<p class="tx">But <span class="epub-i1">saidin</span> … that liquid fire that he wrestled with, like a serpent that was trying to consume him. She pulled back. Was it tainted? She wasn’t certain she could tell. <span class="epub-i1">Saidin</span> was so different, so alien. Reports from the early days fragmented, spoke of the taint like an oil slick upon a river. Well, she could see a river—more a stream, really. It appeared that Androl had been honest with her, and wasn’t very powerful. She could not sense any taint—but then again, she did not know what to look for.</p>
<p class="tx">“I wonder…” Androl said. “I wonder if I can make a gateway with this power.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Gateways don’t work in the Black Tower anymore.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I know,” he said. “But I keep feeling that they’re just beyond my fingertips.”</p>
<p class="tx">Pevara opened her eyes, looking at him. She could feel his honesty within the circle, but creating a gateway required a <span class="epub-i1">lot</span> of the One Power, at least for a woman. Androl would have to be orders of magnitude too weak for that weave. Could it require a different level of strength for a man?</p>
<p class="tx">He reached out a hand, using her Power somehow, mixed with his own. She could feel him pulling the One Power through her. Pevara tried to maintain her composure, but she did not like him having control. She could do nothing!</p>
<p class="tx">“Androl,” she said. “Release me.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It’s wonderful…” he whispered, eyes unfocused as he stood up. “Is this what it feels like, to be one of the others? Those with strength in the Power?”</p>
<p class="tx">He drew more of her power and used it. Objects in the room began to rise into the air.</p>
<p class="tx">“Androl!” Panic. It was the panic she’d felt after hearing that her parents were dead. She hadn’t known this sense of horror in over a hundred years, not since taking the test for her shawl.</p>
<p class="tx">He had control of her channeling. Absolute control. She began to gasp, trying to reach for him. She could not use <span class="epub-i1">saidar</span> without him releasing it back to her—but he could use it against her. Images of him using her own strength to tie her in Air ran through her mind. She could not end the link. Only he could.</p>
<p class="tx">He noticed, suddenly, and his eyes widened. The circle vanished like a wink of the eye, and her power was her own again. Without thinking, she lashed out. This would not happen again. <span class="epub-i1">She</span> would have the control. The weaves sprang from her before she knew what she was doing.</p>
<p class="tx">Androl fell to his knees, hand sweeping across his table as he threw his head back, brushing tools and scraps of leather to the floor. He gasped. “What have you done?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Taim said we could pick any of you,” Pevara muttered as she realized what she <span class="epub-i1">had</span> done. She’d bonded him. The reverse, after a fashion, of what he’d done to her. She tried to calm her thundering heart. An awareness of him blossomed in the back of her mind, like what they’d known in the circle, but somehow more personal. Intimate.</p>
<p class="tx">“Taim is a monster!” Androl growled. “You know that. You take his word on what you can do, and you do it without my permission?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I … I…”</p>
<p class="tx">Androl clenched his jaw, and Pevara immediately felt <span class="epub-i1">something</span>. Something alien, something strange. It felt like looking at herself. Feeling her emotions circled back on her endlessly.</p>
<p class="tx">Her <span class="epub-i1">self</span> melded with <span class="epub-i1">his</span> for a seeming eternity. She knew what it was like to be him, think his thoughts. She saw his life in the blink of an eye, was absorbed by his memories. She gasped and fell to her knees in front of him.</p>
<p class="tx">It faded. Not completely, but it faded. It felt like swimming a hundred leagues through boiling water, and only now emerging, having forgotten what it was like to have normal sensations.</p>
<p class="tx">“Light…” she whispered. “What was that?”</p>
<p class="tx">He lay on his back. When had he fallen? He blinked, looking up at the ceiling. “I saw one of the others do it. Some of the Asha’man bond their wives.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You <span class="epub-i1">bonded</span> me?” she said, horrified.</p>
<p class="tx">He groaned, rolling over. “You did it to me first.”</p>
<p class="tx">She realized, with horror, that she could still feel his emotions. His self. She could even understand some of what he was thinking. Not the actual thoughts, but some impressions of them.</p>
<p class="tx">He was confused, worried and … curious. He was curious about the new experience. <span class="epub-i1">Foolish man!</span></p>
<p class="tx">She’d hoped that the two bonds would have somehow canceled one another out. They did not. “We have to stop this,” she said. “I’ll release you. I vow it. Just … just release me.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t know how,” he said, standing up and breathing in deeply. “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="tx">He was telling the truth. “That circle was a bad idea,” she said. He offered a hand to help her to her feet. She stood on her own without accepting it.</p>
<p class="tx">“I believe it was <span class="epub-i1">your</span> bad idea before it was mine.”</p>
<p class="tx">“So it was,” she admitted. “It isn’t my first one, but it might be one of my worst.” She sat down. “We need to think through this. Find a way to—”</p>
<p class="tx">The door to his shop slammed open.</p>
<p class="tx">Androl spun, and Pevara embraced the Source. Androl had grabbed his stitching groover in one hand like a weapon. He’d also seized the One Power. She could sense that molten force within him—weak because of his lack of talent, like a single small jet of magma, but still burning and hot. She could feel his awe. So it was the same for him as it was for her. Holding the One Power felt like opening your eyes for the first time, the world coming to life.</p>
<p class="tx">Fortunately, neither weapon nor the One Power was needed. Young Evin stood in the doorway, raindrops dribbling down the sides of his face. He shut the door and hurried to Androl’s workbench.</p>
<p class="tx">“Androl, it—” He froze, seeing Pevara.</p>
<p class="tx">“Evin,” Androl said. “You’re alone.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I left Nalaam to watch,” he said, breathing in and out. “It was important, Androl.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We are <span class="epub-i1">never</span> to be alone, Evin,” Androl said. “Never. Always in pairs. No matter the emergency.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I know, I know,” Evin said. “I’m sorry. It’s just—the news, Androl.” He glanced at Pevara.</p>
<p class="tx">“Speak,” Androl said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Welyn and his Aes Sedai are back,” Ewan said.</p>
<p class="tx">Pevara could feel Androl’s sudden tension. “Is he … one of us, still?”</p>
<p class="tx">Evin shook his head, sick. “He’s one of them. Probably Jenare Sedai is, too. I don’t know her well enough to tell for sure. Welyn, though … his eyes aren’t his own any longer, and he now serves Taim.”</p>
<p class="tx">Androl groaned. Welyn had been with Logain. Androl and the others had been holding to the hope that although Mezar had been taken, Logain and Welyn were still free.</p>
<p class="tx">“Logain?” Androl whispered.</p>
<p class="tx">“He isn’t here,” Evin said, “but Androl, Welyn says Logain will come back soon—and that he’s met with Taim, and they have reconciled their differences. Welyn is promising that Logain will come tomorrow to prove it. Androl … that’s it. We have to admit it now. They have him.”</p>
<p class="tx">Pevara could feel Androl’s agreement, and his horror. It mirrored her own.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Aviendha moved through the darkened camps silently.</p>
<p class="tx">So many groups. There had to be at least a hundred thousand people gathered here at the Field of Merrilor. All waiting. Like a breath taken in and held before a great leap.</p>
<p class="tx">The Aiel saw her, but she did not approach them. The wetlanders didn’t notice her, save for a Warder who spotted her as she skirted the Aes Sedai camp. That camp was a place of motion and activity. Something had happened, though she caught only fragments. A Trolloc attack somewhere?</p>
<p class="tx">She listened enough to determine that the attack was in Andor, in the city of Caemlyn. There was worry the Trollocs would leave the city and rampage across the land.</p>
<p class="tx">She needed to know more; would the spears be danced tonight? Perhaps Elayne would share news with her. Aviendha moved silently out of the Aes Sedai camp. Stepping softly in these wet lands, with their lush plants, presented different challenges than the Three-fold Land did. There, the dry ground was often dusty, which could muffle footsteps. Here, a dry twig could inexplicably be buried beneath wet grass.</p>
<p class="tx">She tried not to think about how dead that grass seemed. Once, she’d have considered those browns lush. Now, she knew these wetland plants should <span class="epub-i1">not</span> look so wan and … and hollow.</p>
<p class="tx">Hollow plants. What was she thinking? She shook her head and crept through the shadows out of the Aes Sedai camp. She briefly contemplated sneaking back to surprise that Warder—he’d been hiding in a moss-worn cleft in the rubble of an old, fallen building and watching the Aes Sedai perimeter—but discarded the idea. She wanted to get to Elayne and ask her for details on the attack.</p>
<p class="tx">Aviendha approached another busy camp, ducked beneath the leafless branches of a tree—she didn’t know what type, but its limbs spread wide and high—and slipped inside the guard perimeter. A pair of wetlanders in white and red stood on “watch” near a fire. They didn’t come close to spotting her, though they did jump up and level polearms toward a thicket a good thirty feet away when an animal rustled in it.</p>
<p class="tx">Aviendha shook her head and passed them.</p>
<p class="tx">Forward. She needed to keep moving forward. What to do about Rand al’Thor? What were his plans for tomorrow? These were other questions she wanted to ask Elayne.</p>
<p class="tx">The Aiel needed a purpose once Rand al’Thor finished with them. That was clear from the visions. She had to find a way to give this to them. Perhaps they should return to the Three-fold Land. But … no. No. It tore her heart, but she had to admit that if the Aiel did so, they would be going to their graves. Their death, as a people, might not be immediate, but it would come. The changing world, with new devices and new ways of fighting, would overtake the Aiel, and the Seanchan would never leave them alone. Not with women who could channel. Not with armies full of spears that could, at any time, invade.</p>
<p class="tx">A patrol approached. Aviendha drew some fallen brown undergrowth over herself for camouflage, then lay down flat beside a dead shrub and remained perfectly still. The guards walked two handspans from her.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">We could attack the Seanchan now,</span> she thought. <span class="epub-i1">In my vision, the Aiel waited nearly a generation to attack—and that let the Seanchan strengthen their position.</span></p>
<p class="tx">The Aiel already spoke of the Seanchan and the confrontation that must inevitably come. The Seanchan would force it, everyone whispered. Except, in her vision, years had passed with the Seanchan failing to attack. Why? What could possibly have held them back?</p>
<p class="tx">Aviendha rose and crept across to the pathway the guards had taken. She took out her knife and rammed it down into the ground. She left it there, right beside a lantern on a pole, clearly visible even to wetlander eyes. Then she slipped back into the night, hiding near the back of the large tent that was her goal.</p>
<p class="tx">She crouched low and practiced her silent breathing, using the rhythm to calm herself. There were hushed, anxious voices inside the tent. Aviendha did her best not to pay attention to what they were saying. It wouldn’t be proper to eavesdrop.</p>
<p class="tx">As the patrol passed again, she stood up. When they cried out, having found her dagger, she slipped around to the front of the tent. There, avoiding the attention of guards distracted by the commotion, she lifted the flap and stepped inside the tent behind them.</p>
<p class="tx">Some people sat at a table on the far side of the very large tent, huddled around a lamp. They were so busy with their conversation that they did not see her, so she settled down near some cushions to wait.</p>
<p class="tx">It was very hard not to listen in, now that she was so close.</p>
<p class="tx">“… <span class="epub-i1">must</span> send our forces back!” one man barked. “The fall of the capital is a symbol, Your Majesty. A <span class="epub-i1">symbol!</span> We cannot let Caemlyn go or the entire nation will collapse into chaos.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You underestimate the strength of the Andoran people,” said Elayne. She looked very much in control, very strong, her red-gold hair practically glowing in the lamplight. Several of her battle commanders stood behind her, lending authority and a sense of stability to the meeting. Aviendha was pleased to see the fire in her first-sister’s eyes.</p>
<p class="tx">“I have been to Caemlyn, Lord Lir,” Elayne continued. “And I have left a small force of soldiers there to watch and give warning if the Trollocs leave the city. Our spies will use gateways to sneak through the city and find where the remaining Trollocs are herding captives, and then we can mount rescue operations if the Trollocs continue to hold the city.”</p>
<p class="tx">“But the city itself!” Lord Lir said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Caemlyn is lost, Lir,” Lady Dyelin snapped. “We’d be fools to try to mount any kind of assault now.”</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne nodded. “I have held conference with the other High Seats, and they agree with my assessment. For now, the refugees who escaped are safe—I sent them on along toward Whitebridge with guards. If there are people alive within, we will try to rescue them with gateways, but I will <span class="epub-i1">not</span> commit my forces to an all-out attack on Caemlyn’s walls.”</p>
<p class="tx">“But—”</p>
<p class="tx">“Taking the city again would be fruitless,” Elayne said, voice hard. “I know full well the damage that can be done to an army assaulting those walls! Andor will not collapse because of the loss of one city, no matter how important a city.” Her face was a mask, her voice as cold as good steel.</p>
<p class="tx">“The Trollocs will eventually leave the city,” Elayne continued. “They gain nothing by holding it—they will starve themselves out, if nothing else. Once they leave, we can fight them—and on far fairer ground. If you wish, Lord Lir, you may visit the city yourself and see that what I say is true. The soldiers there could use the inspiration of a High Seat.”</p>
<p class="tx">Lir frowned, but nodded. “I think I will.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Then go knowing my plan. We will begin sending in scouts before the night is through, trying to find pens of civilians to save, and <span class="epub-i1">Aviendha, what in the name of a bloody goat’s left stone are you doing!</span>”</p>
<p class="tx">Aviendha looked up from trimming her fingernails with her second knife. <span class="epub-i1">Bloody goat’s left stone</span>? That was a new one. Elayne always knew the most interesting curses.</p>
<p class="tx">The three High Seats at the table jumped up, scrambling, throwing down chairs and reaching for swords. Elayne sat in her place, eyes and mouth wide.</p>
<p class="tx">“It is a bad habit,” Aviendha admitted, slipping her knife back into her boot. “My nails were growing long, but I should not have done it in your tent, Elayne. I am sorry. I hope I did not offend.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m not talking about your flaming nails, Aviendha,” Elayne said. “How … when did you arrive? Why didn’t the guards announce you?”</p>
<p class="tx">“They didn’t see me,” Aviendha said. “I didn’t wish to make a fuss, and wetlanders can be touchy. I thought they might turn me away, now that you are Queen.” She smiled as she said the last part. Elayne had much honor; the way of becoming a leader among the wetlanders was different from proper ways—things could be so backward over here—but Elayne had handled herself well and obtained her throne. Aviendha couldn’t have been more proud of a spear-sister who had taken a clan chief <span class="epub-i1">gai’shain</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">“They didn’t…” Elayne said. Suddenly, she was smiling. “You crept through the <span class="epub-i1">entire camp</span>, to my tent at the center, and then slipped inside and sat down not five feet from me. And nobody saw.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I didn’t wish to make a fuss.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You have a strange way of not making a fuss.”</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne’s companions did not react with such calm. One of the three, young Lord Perival, gazed around him with worried eyes, as if searching for other intruders.</p>
<p class="tx">“My Queen,” Lir said. “We must punish this breach in security! I will find the men who were lax in their duty and see that they—”</p>
<p class="tx">“Peace,” Elayne said. “I will speak to my guards and suggest they keep their eyes a little more open. Still, guarding the front of a tent is a silly precaution—and always has been—as someone can just cut their way into the back.”</p>
<p class="tx">“And ruin a good tent?” Aviendha said, lips turning down. “Only if we had blood feud, Elayne.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Lord Lir, you may go inspect the city—from a good distance—if you wish,” Elayne said, standing. “If any of the rest of you wish to accompany him, you may. Dyelin, I will see you in the morning.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Very well,” the lords said in turn, then walked from the tent. Both kept distrustful eyes on Aviendha as they left. Dyelin just shook her head before following them, and Elayne sent her battle commanders out to coordinate scouting of the city. That left Elayne and Aviendha alone in the tent.</p>
<p class="tx">“Light, Aviendha,” Elayne said, embracing her, “if the people who want me dead had half of your skill…”</p>
<p class="tx">“Did I do something wrong?” Aviendha said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Other than sneaking into my tent like an assassin?”</p>
<p class="tx">“But you are my first-sister…” Aviendha said. “Should I have asked? But we are not under a roof. Or … among wetlanders, is a tent considered a roof, as in a hold? I’m sorry, Elayne. Do I have <span class="epub-i1">toh</span>? You are such an unpredictable people, it’s hard to know what will offend you and what will not.”</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne just laughed. “Aviendha, you’re a gem. A complete and total <span class="epub-i1">gem</span>. Light, but it’s good to see your face. I needed a friendly one tonight.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Caemlyn has fallen?” Aviendha asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“Near enough,” Elayne said, face growing colder. “It was that bloody Waygate. I thought it was safe—I had that thing all but bricked up, with fifty guards at the door and the <span class="epub-i1">Avendesora</span> leaves taken and both put on the outside.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Someone inside Caemlyn let them in, then.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Darkfriends,” Elayne said. “A dozen members of the Guard—we were lucky enough that one man survived their betrayal and found his way out. Light, I don’t know why I should be surprised. If they’re in the White Tower, they’re in Andor. But these were men who had rejected Gaebril, and who seemed loyal. They waited all this time only to betray us now.”</p>
<p class="tx">Aviendha grimaced, but took one of the chairs to join Elayne at the table, rather than staying on the floor. Her first-sister preferred sitting that way. Her stomach had swelled with the children she bore.</p>
<p class="tx">“I sent Birgitte with the soldiers to the city to see what can be done,” Elayne said. “But we’ve done what we can for the night, the city watched, the refugees seen to. Light, I wish I could do more. The worst thing about being Queen is not the things you must do, but the things that you cannot.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We will bring the battle to them soon enough,” Aviendha said.</p>
<p class="tx">“We will,” Elayne said, eyes smoldering. “I will bring them fire and fury, repayment in kind for the flames they brought to my people.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I heard you speak to those men of not attacking the city.”</p>
<p class="tx">“No,” Elayne said. “I will not give them the satisfaction of holding my own walls against me. I have given Birgitte an order—the Trollocs will eventually abandon Caemlyn, of this we are sure. Birgitte will find a way to hasten that, so we can fight them outside of the city.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Do not let the enemy choose your battleground,” Aviendha said with a nod. “A good strategy. And … Rand’s meeting?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I will attend,” Elayne said. “I must, so it will be done. He had better not give us theatrics and stalling. My people die, my city burns, the world is two steps from the edge of a cliff. I will stay through the afternoon only; after that, I go back to Andor.” She hesitated. “Will you come with me?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Elayne…” Aviendha said. “I cannot leave my people. I am a Wise One now.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You went to Rhuidean?” Elayne asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes,” Aviendha said. Though it pained her to keep secrets, she said nothing of her visions there.</p>
<p class="tx">“Excellent. I—” Elayne began, but was cut off.</p>
<p class="tx">“My Queen?” the tent guard called from outside. “Messenger for you.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Let them in.”</p>
<p class="tx">The guard opened the flaps for a young Guardswoman with a messenger’s ribbon on her coat. She performed an ornate bow, one hand removing her hat as the other held out a letter.</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne took the letter but didn’t open it. The messenger retreated.</p>
<p class="tx">“Perhaps we can still fight together, Aviendha,” Elayne said. “If I have my way, I will have Aiel at my side as I reclaim Andor. The Trollocs in Caemlyn present a serious threat to all of us; even if I draw their main force out, the Shadow can continue to pour Shadowspawn through that Waygate.</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m thinking that while my armies fight the main body of Trollocs outside of Caemlyn—I will have to make the city inhospitable to the Shadowspawn somehow—I will send a smaller force through a gateway to seize the Waygate. If I could gain the aid of Aiel for that…”</p>
<p class="tx">As she spoke, she embraced the Source—Aviendha could see the glow—and absently sliced the letter open, breaking the seal with a ribbon of Air.</p>
<p class="tx">Aviendha raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="tx">“Sorry,” Elayne said, “I’ve reached the point in my pregnancy where I can channel again reliably, and I keep finding excuses…”</p>
<p class="tx">“Do not endanger the babes,” Aviendha said.</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m not going to endanger them,” Elayne said. “You’re as bad as Birgitte. At least no one has any goat’s milk here. Min says…” She trailed off, eyes flickering back and forth as she read the letter. Elayne’s expression darkened, and Aviendha prepared herself for a shock.</p>
<p class="tx">“Oh, that man…” Elayne said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Rand?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I think I may strangle him one of these days.”</p>
<p class="tx">Aviendha set her jaw. “If he’s offended—”</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne turned the letter around. “He <span class="epub-i1">insists</span> that I return to Caemlyn to see to my people. He gives a dozen reasons why, going so far as to ‘release me from my obligation’ to meet with him tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="tx">“He should not be insisting on anything with you.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Particularly not so forcefully,” Elayne said. “Light, this is clever. He’s obviously trying to bully me into <span class="epub-i1">staying</span>. There’s a touch of <span class="epub-i1">Daes</span> <span class="epub-i1">Dae’mar</span> in this.”</p>
<p class="tx">Aviendha hesitated. “You seem proud. Yet I gather this letter is only one step away from being insulting!”</p>
<p class="tx">“I am proud,” Elayne said. “And angry at him. But proud because he knew to make me angry like that. Light! We’ll make a king out of you yet, Rand. Why does he want me at the meeting so badly? Does he think I’ll support his side just because of my affection for him?”</p>
<p class="tx">“You don’t know what his plan is, then?”</p>
<p class="tx">“No. It obviously involves all of the rulers. But I will attend, even though I’m likely to do so without having had any sleep tonight. I am meeting with Birgitte and my other commanders in an hour to go over plans for drawing out, then destroying, the Trollocs.” A fire still burned behind those eyes of hers. Elayne was a warrior, as true a one as Aviendha had ever known.</p>
<p class="tx">“I must go to him,” Aviendha said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Tonight?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Tonight. The Last Battle will soon begin.”</p>
<p class="tx">“As far as I’m concerned, it started the moment those bloody Trollocs set foot in Caemlyn,” Elayne said. “May the Light favor us. It is here.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Then the day of dying will come,” Aviendha said. “Many of us will soon wake from this dream. There may not be another night for Rand and myself. I came to you, in part, to ask you about this.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You have my blessing,” Elayne said softly. “You are my first-sister. Have you spent time with Min?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Not enough, and under other circumstances I would remedy that lack immediately. There is no time.”</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne nodded.</p>
<p class="tx">“I do think she feels better about me,” Aviendha said. “She did me a great honor in helping me understand the last step to becoming a Wise One. It may be appropriate to bend some of the customs. We have done well, under the circumstances. I would speak to her together with you, if there is time.”</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne nodded. “I can spare a moment or two between meetings. I’ll send for her.”</p>
