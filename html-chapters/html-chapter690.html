<p class="chapterOpenerText">The air felt calmer at night, though the thunder still warned Lan that not all was well. In his weeks traveling with Bulen, that storm above seemed to have grown darker.</p>
<p class="para">After riding southward, they continued on to the east; they were somewhere near the border between Kandor and Saldaea, on the Plain of Lances. Towering, weathered hills—steep-sided, like fortresses—rose around them.</p>
<p class="para">Perhaps they’d missed the border. There often was no marker on these back roads, and the mountains cared not which nation tried to claim them.</p>
<p class="para">“Master Andra,” Bulen said from behind. Lan had purchased a horse for him to ride, a dusty white mare. He still led his packhorse, Scouter.</p>
<p class="para">Bulen caught up to him. Lan insisted upon being called “Andra.” One follower was bad enough. If nobody knew who he was, they couldn’t ask to come with him. He had Bulen to thank—inadvertently—for the warning of what Nynaeve had done. For that, he owed the man a debt.</p>
<p class="para">Bulen <span class="italic1">did</span> like to talk, though.</p>
<p class="para">“Master Andra,” Bulen continued. “If I may suggest, we could turn south at the Berndt Crossroads, yes? I know a waypoint inn in that direction that serves the <span class="italic1">very</span> best quail. We could turn eastward again on the road to South Mettler. A <span class="italic1">much</span> easier path. My cousin has a farm along that road—cousin on my mother’s side, Master Andra—and we could—”</p>
<p class="para">“We continue this way,” Lan said.</p>
<p class="para">“But South Mettler is a much better roadway!”</p>
<p class="para">“And therefore much better traveled too, Bulen.”</p>
<p class="para">Bulen sighed, but fell silent. The <span class="italic1">hadori</span> looked good around his head, and he had proven surprisingly capable with the sword. As talented a student as Lan had seen in a while.</p>
<p class="para">It was dark—night came early here, because of those mountains. Compared to the areas near the Blight, it also felt chilly. Unfortunately, the land here was fairly well populated. Indeed, about an hour past the crossroads they arrived at an inn, windows still glowing with light.</p>
<p class="para">Bulen looked toward it longingly, but Lan continued on. He had them traveling at night, mostly. The better to keep from being seen.</p>
<p class="para">A trio of men sat in front of the inn, smoking their pipes in the darkness. The pungent smoke wound in the air, past the inn’s windows. Lan didn’t give them much consideration until—as a group—they broke off their smoking. They unhooked horses from the fence at the side of the inn.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Wonderful,</span> Lan thought. Highwaymen, watching the night road for weary travelers. Well, three men shouldn’t prove too dangerous. They rode behind Lan at a trot. They wouldn’t attack until they were farther from the inn. Lan reached to loosen his sword in its sheath.</p>
<p class="para">“My Lord,” Bulen said urgently, looking over his shoulder. “Two of those men are wearing the <span class="italic1">hadori</span>.”</p>
<p class="para">Lan spun around, cloak whipping behind him. The three men approached and did not stop. They split around him and Bulen.</p>
<p class="para">Lan watched them pass. “Andere?” he called. “What do you think you’re doing?”</p>
<p class="para">One of the three—a lean, dangerous-looking man—glanced over his shoulder, his long hair held back with the <span class="italic1">hadori</span>. It had been years since Lan had seen Andere. He looked as if he’d given up his Kandori uniform, finally; he was wearing a deep black cloak and hunting leathers underneath.</p>
<p class="para">“Ah, Lan,” Andere said, the three men pulling up to stop. “I didn’t notice you there.”</p>
<p class="para">“I’m sure you didn’t,” Lan said flatly. “And you, Nazar. You put your <span class="italic1">hadori</span> away when you were a lad. Now you don one?”</p>
<p class="para">“I may do as I wish,” Nazar said. He was getting old—he must be past his seventieth year—but he carried a sword on his saddle. His hair had gone white.</p>
<p class="para">The third man, Rakim, wasn’t Malkieri. He had the tilted eyes of a Saldaean, and he shrugged at Lan, looking a little embarrassed.</p>
<p class="para">Lan raised his fingers to his forehead, closing his eyes as the three rode ahead. What foolish game were they playing? <span class="italic1">No matter,</span> Lan thought, opening his eyes.</p>
<p class="para">Bulen started to say something, but Lan quieted him with a glare. He turned southward off the road, cutting down a small, worn trail.</p>
<p class="para">Before long, he heard muffled hoofbeats from behind. Lan spun as he saw the three men riding behind him. Lan pulled Mandarb to a halt, teeth gritted. “I’m <span class="italic1">not</span> raising the Golden Crane!”</p>
<p class="para">“We didn’t say you were,” Nazar said. The three parted around him again, riding past.</p>
<p class="para">Lan kicked Mandarb forward, riding up to them. “Then stop following me.”</p>
<p class="para">“Last I checked, we were ahead of you,” Andere said.</p>
<p class="para">“You turned this way after me,” Lan accused.</p>
<p class="para">“You don’t own the roads, Lan Mandragoran,” Andere said. He glanced at Lan, face shadowed in the night. “If you haven’t noticed, I’m no longer the boy the Hero of Salmarna berated so long ago. I’ve become a soldier, and soldiers are needed. So I will ride this way if I please.”</p>
<p class="para">“I <span class="italic1">command</span> you to turn and go back,” Lan said. “Find a different path eastward.”</p>
<p class="para">Rakim laughed, his voice still hoarse after all these years. “You’re not my captain any longer, Lan. Why would I obey your orders?” The others chuckled.</p>
<p class="para">“We’d obey a king, of course,” Nazar said.</p>
<p class="para">“Yes,” Andere said. “If <span class="italic1">he</span> gave us commands, perhaps we would. But I don’t see a king here. Unless I’m mistaken.”</p>
<p class="para">“There can be no king of a fallen people,” Lan said. “No king without a kingdom.”</p>
<p class="para">“And yet you ride,” Nazar said, flicking his reins. “Ride to your death in a land you <span class="italic1">claim</span> is no kingdom.”</p>
<p class="para">“It is my destiny.”</p>
<p class="para">The three shrugged, then pulled ahead of him.</p>
<p class="para">“Don’t be fools,” Lan said, voice soft as he pulled Mandarb to a halt. “This path leads to death.”</p>
<p class="para">“Death is lighter than a feather, Lan Mandragoran,” Rakim called over his shoulder. “If we ride only to death, then the trail will be easier than I’d thought!”</p>
<p class="para">Lan gritted his teeth, but what was he to do? Beat all three of them senseless and leave them beside the road? He nudged Mandarb forward.</p>
<p class="para">The two had become five.</p>
<p class="centerImage1"><img src="../images/00561.jpeg" alt="image" class="epubimage12"/></p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Galad continued his morning meal, noting that Child Byar had come to speak with him. The meal was simple fare: porridge with a handful of raisins stirred in. A simple meal for every soldier kept them all from envy. Some Lords Captain Commander had dined far better than their men. That would not do for Galad. Not when so many in the world starved.</p>
<p class="para">Child Byar waited inside the flaps of Galad’s tent, awaiting recognition. The gaunt, sunken-cheeked man wore his white cloak, a tabard over mail underneath.</p>
<p class="para">Galad eventually set aside his spoon and nodded to Byar. The soldier strode up to the table and waited, still at attention. There were no elaborate furnishings to Galad’s tent. His sword—Valda’s sword—lay on the plain table behind his wooden bowl, slightly drawn. The herons on the blade peeked out from beneath the scabbard, and the polished steel reflected Byar’s form.</p>
<p class="para">“Speak,” Galad said.</p>
<p class="para">“I have more news about the army, my Lord Captain Commander,” Byar said. “They are near where the captives said they would be, a few days from us.”</p>
<p class="para">Galad nodded. “They fly the flag of Ghealdan?”</p>
<p class="para">“Alongside the flag of Mayene.” That flame of zeal glinted in Byar’s eyes. “And the wolfhead, though reports say they took that down late yesterday. Goldeneyes <span class="italic1">is</span> there. Our scouts are sure of it.”</p>
<p class="para">“Did he really kill Bornhald’s father?”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, my Lord Captain Commander. I have a familiarity with this creature. He and his troops come from a place called the Two Rivers.”</p>
<p class="para">“The Two Rivers?” Galad said. “Curious, how often I seem to hear of that place, these days. Is that not where al’Thor is from?”</p>
<p class="para">“So it is said,” Byar replied.</p>
<p class="para">Galad rubbed his chin. “They grow good tabac there, Child Byar, but I have not heard of them growing armies.”</p>
<p class="para">“It is a dark place, my Lord Captain Commander. Child Bornhald and I spent some time there last year; it is festering with Darkfriends.”</p>
<p class="para">Galad sighed. “You sound like a Questioner.”</p>
<p class="para">“My Lord Captain Commander,” Byar earnestly continued, “my Lord, please believe me. I am <span class="italic1">not</span> simply speculating. This is different.”</p>
<p class="para">Galad frowned. Then he gestured toward the other stool beside his table. Byar took it.</p>
<p class="para">“Explain yourself,” Galad said. “And tell me everything you know of this Perrin Goldeneyes.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Perrin could remember a time when simple breakfasts of bread and cheese had satisfied him. That was no longer the case. Perhaps it was due to his relationship with the wolves, or maybe his tastes had changed over time. These days he craved meat, especially in the morning. He couldn’t always have it, and that was fine. But generally he didn’t have to ask.</p>
<p class="para">That was the case this day. He’d risen, washed his face, and found a servant entering with a large chop of ham, steaming and succulent. No beans, no vegetables. No gravy. Just the ham, rubbed with salt and seared over the fire, with a pair of boiled eggs. The serving woman set them on his table, then withdrew.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin wiped his hands, crossing the rug of his tent and taking in the ham’s scent. Part of him felt he should turn it away, but he couldn’t. Not when it was right there. He sat down, took up fork and knife and dug in.</p>
<p class="para">“I still don’t see how you can eat that for <span class="italic1">breakfast</span>,” Faile noted, leaving the washing chamber of their tent, wiping her hands on a cloth. Their large tent had several curtained divisions to it. She wore one of her unobtrusive gray dresses. Perfect, because it didn’t distract from her beauty. It was accented by a sturdy black belt—she had sent away all of her golden belts, no matter how fine. He’d suggested finding her one that was more to her liking, and she’d looked sick.</p>
<p class="para">“It’s food,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para">“I can see,” she said with a snort, looking herself over in the mirror. “What did you think I assumed it was? A rock?”</p>
<p class="para">“I meant,” Perrin said between bites, “that food is food. Why should I care what I eat for breakfast and what I eat for a different meal?”</p>
<p class="para">“Because it’s strange,” she said, clasping on a cord holding a small blue stone. She regarded herself in the mirror, then turned, the loose sleeves of her Saldaean-cut dress swishing. She paused beside his plate, grimacing. “I’m having breakfast with Alliandre. Send for me if there is news.”</p>
<p class="para">He nodded, swallowing. Why should a person have meat at midday, but refuse it for breakfast? It didn’t make sense.</p>
<p class="para">He’d decided to remain camped beside the Jehannah Road. What else was he to do, with an army of Whitecloaks directly ahead, between him and Lugard? His scouts needed time to assess the danger. He’d spent much time thinking about the strange visions he’d seen, the wolves chasing sheep toward a beast and Faile walking toward a cliff. He hadn’t been able to make sense of them, but could they have something to do with the Whitecloaks? Their appearance bothered him more than he wanted to admit, but he harbored a tiny hope that they would prove insignificant and not slow him too much.</p>
<p class="para">“Perrin Aybara,” a voice called from outside his tent. “Do you give me leave to enter?”</p>
<p class="para">“Come in, Gaul,” he called. “My shade is yours.”</p>
<p class="para">The tall Aiel strode in. “Thank you, Perrin Aybara,” he said, glancing at the ham. “Quite a feast. Do you celebrate?”</p>
<p class="para">“Nothing besides breakfast.”</p>
<p class="para">“A mighty victory,” Gaul said, laughing.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin shook his head. Aiel humor. He’d stopped trying to make sense of it. Gaul settled himself on the ground and Perrin sighed inwardly before picking up his plate and moving to sit on the rug across from Gaul. Perrin placed the meal in his lap and continued to eat.</p>
<p class="para">“You need not sit on the floor because of me,” Gaul said.</p>
<p class="para">“I’m not doing it because I <span class="italic1">need</span> to, Gaul.”</p>
<p class="para">Gaul nodded.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin cut off another bite. This would be so much easier if he grabbed the whole thing in his fingers and started ripping off chunks. Eating was simpler for wolves. Utensils. What was the point?</p>
<p class="para">Thoughts like that gave him pause. He was <span class="italic1">not</span> a wolf, and didn’t want to think like one. Maybe he should start having fruit for a proper breakfast, as Faile said. He frowned, then turned back to his meat.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">“We fought Trollocs in the Two Rivers,” Byar said, lowering his voice. Galad’s porridge cooled, forgotten on the table. “Several dozen men in our camp can confirm it. I killed several of the beasts with my own sword.”</p>
<p class="para">“Trollocs in the <span class="italic1">Two Rivers</span>?” Galad said. “That’s hundreds of leagues from the Borderlands!”</p>
<p class="para">“They were there nonetheless,” Byar said. “Lord Captain Commander Niall must have suspected it. We were sent to the place on his orders. You know that Pedron Niall would not have simply jumped at nothing.”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes. I agree. But the Two Rivers?”</p>
<p class="para">“It <span class="italic1">is</span> full of Darkfriends,” Byar said. “Bornhald told you of Goldeneyes. In the Two Rivers, this Perrin Aybara was raising the flag of ancient Manetheren and gathering an army from among the farmers. Trained soldiers may scoff at farmers pressed into service, but get enough of them together, and they can be a danger. Some are skilled with the staff or the bow.”</p>
<p class="para">“I am aware,” Galad said flatly, recalling a particularly embarrassing lesson he’d once been given.</p>
<p class="para">“That man, this Perrin Aybara,” Byar continued. “He’s Shadowspawn, as plain as day. They call him Goldeneyes because his eyes <span class="italic1">are</span> golden, no shade that any person has ever known. We were certain that Aybara was bringing the Trollocs in, using them to force the people of the Two Rivers to join his army. He eventually ran us out of the place. Now he’s here, before us.”</p>
<p class="para">A coincidence, or something more?</p>
<p class="para">Byar was obviously thinking along the same lines. “My Lord Captain Commander, perhaps I should have mentioned this earlier, but the Two Rivers wasn’t my first experience with this creature Aybara. He killed two of the Children on a forgotten road in Andor some two years ago. I was traveling with Bornhald’s father. We met Aybara in a campsite off a main road. He was running with wolves like a wildman! He killed two men before we could subdue him, then escaped into the night after we had him captured. My Lord, he was to be hanged.”</p>
<p class="para">“There are others who can confirm this?” Galad asked.</p>
<p class="para">“Child Oratar can. And Child Bornhald can confirm what we saw in the Two Rivers. Goldeneyes <span class="italic1">was</span> at Falme, too. For what he did there alone he should be brought to justice. It is clear. The Light has delivered him to us.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">“You’re certain our people are among the Whitecloaks?” Perrin asked.</p>
<p class="para">“I could not see faces,” Gaul said, “but Elyas Machera’s eyes are very keen. He says he’s certain he saw Basel Gill.”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin nodded. Elyas’ golden eyes would be as good as Perrin’s own.</p>
<p class="para">“Sulin and her scouts have similar reports,” Gaul said, accepting a cup of ale poured from Perrin’s pitcher. “The Whitecloak army has a large number of carts, much like the ones we sent ahead. She discovered this early in the morning, but asked me to pass these words to you once you awoke, as she knows that wetlanders are temperamental when disturbed in the morning.”</p>
<p class="para">Gaul obviously had no idea that he might be giving offense. Perrin was a wetlander. Wetlanders were temperamental, at least in the opinion of the Aiel. So Gaul was stating an accepted fact.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin shook his head, trying one of the eggs. Overcooked, but edible. “Did Sulin spot anyone she recognized?”</p>
<p class="para">“No, though she saw some <span class="italic1">gai’shain</span>,” Gaul said. “However, Sulin is a Maiden, so perhaps we should send someone to confirm what she said—someone who won’t demand the opportunity to wash our smallclothes.”</p>
<p class="para">“Trouble with Bain and Chiad?” Perrin asked.</p>
<p class="para">Gaul grimaced. “I swear, those women will drive the mind from me. What man should be expected to suffer such things? Almost better to have Sightblinder himself as a <span class="italic1">gai’shain</span> than those two.”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin chuckled.</p>
<p class="para">“Regardless, the captives look unharmed and healthy. There is more to the report. One of the Maidens saw a flag flying over the camp that looked distinctive, so she copied it down for your secretary, Sebban Balwer. He says that it means the Lord Captain Commander himself rides with this army.”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin looked down at the last chunk of ham. That was not good news. He’d never met the Lord Captain Commander, but he <span class="italic1">had</span> met one of the Whitecloak Lords Captain once. That had been the night when Hopper had died, a night that had haunted Perrin for two years.</p>
<p class="para">That had been the night when he had killed for the first time.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">“What more do you need?” Byar leaned in close, sunken eyes alight with zeal. “We have witnesses who <span class="italic1">saw</span> this man murder two of our own! Do we let him march by, as if innocent?”</p>
<p class="para">“No,” Galad said. “No, by the Light, if what you say is true then we cannot turn our backs on this man. Our duty is to bring justice to the wronged.”</p>
<p class="para">Byar smiled, looking eager. “The prisoners revealed that the Queen of Ghealdan has sworn fealty to him.”</p>
<p class="para">“That could present a problem.”</p>
<p class="para">“Or an opportunity. Perhaps Ghealdan is precisely what the Children need. A new home, a place to rebuild. You speak of Andor, my Lord Captain Commander, but how long will they suffer us? You speak of the Last Battle, but it could be months away. What if we were to free an entire nation from the grip of a terrible Darkfriend? Surely the Queen—or her successor—would feel indebted to us.”</p>
<p class="para">“Assuming we can defeat this Aybara.”</p>
<p class="para">“We can. Our forces are smaller than his, but many of his soldiers are farmers.”</p>
<p class="para">“Farmers you just pointed out can be dangerous,” Galad said. “They should not be underestimated.”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, but I know we can defeat them. They can be dangerous, yes, but they will break before the might of the Children. This time, finally, Goldeneyes won’t be able to hide behind his little village fortifications or his ragtag allies. No more excuses.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Was this part of being <span class="italic1">ta’veren</span>? Could Perrin not escape that night, years ago? He set his plate aside, feeling sick.</p>
<p class="para">“Are you well, Perrin Aybara?” Gaul said.</p>
<p class="para">“Just thinking.” The Whitecloaks would not leave him alone, and the Pattern—burn it!—was going to keep looping them into his path until he dealt with them.</p>
<p class="para">“How large is their army?” Perrin asked.</p>
<p class="para">“There are twenty thousand soldiers among them,” Gaul replied. “There are several thousand others who have likely never held a spear.”</p>
<p class="para">Servants and camp followers. Gaul kept the amusement from his voice, but Perrin could smell it on him. Among the Aiel, nearly every man—all but blacksmiths—would pick up a spear if they were attacked. The fact that many wetlanders were incapable of defending themselves either befuddled or infuriated the Aiel.</p>
<p class="para">“Their force is large,” Gaul continued, “but ours is larger. And they have no <span class="italic1">algai’d’siswai</span> nor Asha’man, nor channelers of any type, if Sebban Balwer’s word is not in error. He seems to know much of these Whitecloaks.”</p>
<p class="para">“He’s right. Whitecloaks hate Aes Sedai and think anyone who can use the One Power is a Darkfriend.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">“We move against him, then?” Byar asked.</p>
<p class="para">Galad stood. “We have no choice. The Light has delivered him into our hands. But we need more information. Perhaps I should go to this Aybara and let him know that we hold his allies, and then ask his army to meet with us on the field of battle. I’d rather draw him out to make use of my cavalry.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">“What do you want, Perrin Aybara?” Gaul asked.</p>
<p class="para">What did he want? He wished he could answer that.</p>
<p class="para">“Send more scouts,” Perrin said. “Find us a better place to camp. We’ll want to offer parley, but there’s no way under the Light I’m leaving Gill and the others in the hands of the Whitecloaks. We’ll give the Children a chance to return our people. If they don’t…well, then we’ll see.”</p>
