<p class="chapterOpenerText">Perrin ran through the darkness. Trails of watery mist brushed his face and condensed in his beard. His mind was foggy, distant. Where was he going? What was he doing? Why was he running?</p>
<p class="para">He roared and charged, ripping through the veiled darkness and bursting into open air. He took a deep breath and landed on the top of a steep hill covered with short, patchy grass, with a ring of trees at its base. The sky rumbled and churned with clouds, like a boiling pot of tar.</p>
<p class="para">He was in the wolf dream. His body slumbered in the real world, on this hilltop, with Faile. He smiled, breathing deeply. His problems had not diminished. In fact, with the Whitecloak ultimatum, they seemed magnified. But all was well with Faile. That simple fact changed so much. With her at his side, he could do anything.</p>
<p class="para">He leaped down from the hillside and crossed the open area where his army camped. They had been here long enough that signs had appeared in the wolf dream. Tents reflected the waking world, though their flaps were in a different position each time he looked at them. Cook-fire pits in the ground, ruts in the pathways, occasional bits of refuse or discarded tools. These would pop into existence, then vanish.</p>
<p class="para">He moved quickly through the camp, each step taking him ten paces. Once he might have found the lack of people in the camp eerie, but he was accustomed to the wolf dream now. This was natural.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin approached the statue at the side of the camp, then looked up at the age-pocked stone, overgrown with lichen of black, orange and green. The statue must have been posed oddly, if it had fallen in such a way. It almost looked as if it had been created this way—an enormous arm bursting from the loam.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin turned to the southeast, toward where the Whitecloak camp would be found. He had to deal with them. He was increasingly certain—confident, even—that he could not continue until he had confronted these shadows from the past.</p>
<p class="para">There was one way to deal with them for certain. A careful trap using the Asha’man and Wise Ones, and Perrin could hit the Children so hard that they shattered. He could maybe even destroy them permanently as a group.</p>
<p class="para">He had the means, the opportunity, and the motivation. No more fear in the land, no more Whitecloak mock trials. He leaped forward, soaring thirty feet and falling lightly to the ground. Then he took off, running southeast along the road.</p>
<p class="para">He found the Whitecloak camp in a forested hollow, thousands of white tents set up in tight rings. The tents of some ten thousand Children, along with another ten thousand mercenaries and other soldiers. Balwer estimated that this was the bulk of the remaining Children, though he had been unclear on how he’d gotten that knowledge. Hopefully the dusty man’s hatred of the Whitecloaks wasn’t clouding his judgment.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin moved among the tents, looking to see if he could discover anything that Elyas and the Aiel had not. It was unlikely, but he figured it was worth an attempt, while he was here. Besides, he wanted to see the place with his own eyes. He lifted flaps, moved between groupings of tents, inspecting the place and getting a feel for it and its occupants. The camp was arranged in a very orderly manner. The insides were less stable than the tents themselves, but what he saw was also kept orderly.</p>
<p class="para">The Whitecloaks liked things neat, tidy and carefully folded. And they liked to pretend the entire world could be polished up and cleaned the same way, people defined and explained in one or two words.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin shook his head, making his way to the Lord Captain Commander’s tent. The organization of the tents led him to it easily, at the center ring. It wasn’t much larger than the other tents, and Perrin ducked inside, trying to see if he could find anything of use. It was furnished simply, with a bedroll that was in a different position each time Perrin looked at it, along with a table holding objects that vanished and appeared at random.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin stepped up to it, picking up something that appeared there. A signet ring. He didn’t recognize the signet, a winged dagger, but memorized it just before the ring vanished from his fingers, too transient to stay long in the wolf dream. Though he’d met with the Whitecloak leader, and corresponded with the man, he didn’t know much about the man’s past. Perhaps this would help.</p>
<p class="para">He searched through the tent a while longer, finding nothing of use, then went to the large tent where Gaul had explained that many of the captives were being kept. Here, he saw Master Gill’s hat appear for a moment, then vanish.</p>
<p class="para">Satisfied, Perrin walked back out of the tent. As he did so, he found something bothering him. Shouldn’t he have tried something like this when Faile was kidnapped? He’d sent numerous scouts to Malden. Light, he’d had to restrain himself from marching off to find Faile on his own! But he’d never tried visiting the place in the wolf dream.</p>
<p class="para">Perhaps it would have been useless. But he hadn’t considered the possibility, and that troubled him.</p>
<p class="para">He froze, passing a cart parked beside one of the Whitecloak tents. The back was open, and a grizzled silver wolf lay there, watching him.</p>
<p class="para">“I do let my attention grow too narrow, Hopper,” Perrin said. “When I get consumed by a goal, it can make me careless. That can be dangerous. As in battle, when concentrating on the adversary in front of you can expose you to the archer on the side.”</p>
<p class="para">Hopper cracked his mouth open, smiling after the way of wolves. He hopped from the cart. Perrin could sense other wolves nearby—the others of the pack he had run with before. Oak Dancer, Sparks and Boundless.</p>
<p class="para">“All right,” he said to Hopper. “I’m ready to learn.”</p>
<p class="para">Hopper sat down on his haunches, regarding Perrin. <span class="italic1">Follow,</span> the wolf sent.</p>
<p class="para">Then vanished.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin cursed, looking about. Where had the wolf gone? He moved through the camp, searching, but couldn’t sense Hopper anywhere. He reached out with his mind. Nothing.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Young Bull.</span> Suddenly Hopper was behind him. <span class="italic1">Follow.</span> He vanished again.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin growled, then moved about the camp in a flash. When he didn’t find the wolf, he shifted to the field of grain where he’d met Hopper last time. The wolf wasn’t there. Perrin stood among the blowing grain, frustrated.</p>
<p class="para">Hopper found him a few minutes later. The wolf smelled dissatisfied. <span class="italic1">Follow!</span> he sent.</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t know how,” Perrin said. “Hopper, I don’t know where you’re going.”</p>
<p class="para">The wolf sat down. He sent an image of a wolf pup, joining others of the pack. The pup watched his elders and did what they did.</p>
<p class="para">“I’m not a wolf, Hopper,” Perrin said. “I don’t learn the way you do. You must explain to me what you want me to do.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Follow here.</span> The wolf sent an image of, oddly, Emond’s Field. Then he vanished.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin followed, appearing on a familiar green. A group of buildings lined it, which felt wrong. Emond’s Field should have been a little village, not a town with a stone wall and a road running past the mayor’s inn, paved with stones. Much had changed in the short time he had been away.</p>
<p class="para">“Why have we come here?” Perrin asked. Disturbingly, the wolfhead banner still flew on the pole above the green. It could have been a trick of the wolf dream, but he doubted it. He knew all too well how eagerly the people of the Two Rivers flew the standard of “Perrin Goldeneyes.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Men are strange,</span> Hopper sent.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin turned to the old wolf.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Men think strange thoughts,</span> Hopper said. <span class="italic1">We do not try to understand them. Why does the stag flee, the sparrow fly, the tree grow? They do. That is all.</span></p>
<p class="para">“Very well,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">I cannot teach a sparrow to hunt,</span> Hopper continued. <span class="italic1">And a sparrow does not teach a wolf to fly.</span></p>
<p class="para">“But here, you <span class="italic1">can</span> fly,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Yes. And I was not taught. I know.</span> Hopper’s scent was full of emotion and confusion. Wolves all remembered everything that one of their kind knew. Hopper was frustrated because he wanted to teach Perrin, but wasn’t accustomed to doing things in the way of people.</p>
<p class="para">“Please,” Perrin said. “Try to explain to me what you mean. You always tell me I’m here ‘too strongly.’ It’s dangerous, you say. Why?”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">You slumber,</span> Hopper said. <span class="italic1">The other you. You cannot stay here too long. You must always remember that you are unnatural here. This is not your den.</span></p>
<p class="para">Hopper turned toward the houses around them. <span class="italic1">This is your den, the den of your sire. This place. Remember it. It will keep you from being lost. This was how your kind once did it. You understand.</span></p>
<p class="para">It wasn’t a question, though it was something of a plea. Hopper wasn’t certain how to explain further.</p>
<p class="para">“I can try,” Perrin thought, interpreting the sending as best he could. But Hopper was wrong. This place wasn’t his home. Perrin’s home was with Faile. He needed to remember that, somehow, to keep himself from getting drawn into the wolf dream too strongly.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">I have seen your she in your mind, Young Bull,</span> Hopper sent, cocking his head. <span class="italic1">She is like a hive of bees, with sweet honey and sharp stings.</span> Hopper’s image of Faile was that of a very confusing female wolf. One who would playfully nip at his nose one moment, then growl at him the next, refusing to share her meat.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin smiled.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">The memory is part,</span> Hopper sent. <span class="italic1">But the other part is you. You must stay as Young Bull.</span> A wolf’s reflection in the water, shimmering and growing indistinct as ripples crossed it.</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t understand.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">The strength of this place,</span> Hopper sent an image of a wolf carved of stone, <span class="italic1">is the strength of you.</span> The wolf thought for a moment. <span class="italic1">Stand. Remain. Be you.</span></p>
<p class="para">With that, the wolf stood and backed up, as if preparing to run at Perrin.</p>
<p class="para">Confused, Perrin imagined himself as he was, holding that image in his head as strongly as he could.</p>
<p class="para">Hopper ran and jumped at him, slamming his body into Perrin. He’d done this before, somehow <span class="italic1">forcing</span> Perrin out of the wolf dream.</p>
<p class="para">This time, however, Perrin was set and waiting. Instinctively, Perrin pushed back. The wolf dream wavered around him, but then grew firm again. Hopper rebounded off him, though the heavy wolf should have knocked Perrin to the ground.</p>
<p class="para">Hopper shook his head, as if dazed. <span class="italic1">Good,</span> he sent, pleased. <span class="italic1">Good. You learn. Again.</span></p>
<p class="para">Perrin steadied himself just in time to get slammed by Hopper a second time. Perrin growled, but held steady.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Here,</span> Hopper sent, giving an image of the field of grain. Hopper vanished, and Perrin followed. As soon as he appeared, the wolf slammed into him, mind and body.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin fell to the ground this time, everything wavering and shimmering. He felt himself being pushed away, forced out of the wolf dream and into his ordinary dreams.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">No!</span> he thought, holding to an image of himself kneeling among those fields of grain. He <span class="italic1">was</span> there. He imagined it, solid and real. He smelled the oats, the humid air, alive with the scents of dirt and fallen leaves.</p>
<p class="para">The landscape coalesced. He panted, kneeling on the ground, but he was still in the wolf dream.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Good,</span> Hopper sent. <span class="italic1">You learn quickly.</span></p>
<p class="para">“There’s no other option,” Perrin said, climbing to his feet.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">The Last Hunt comes,</span> Hopper agreed, sending an image of the Whitecloak camp.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin followed, bracing himself. No attack came. He looked around for the wolf.</p>
<p class="para">Something slammed into his mind. There was no motion, only the mental attack. It wasn’t as strong as before, but it was unexpected. Perrin barely managed to fight it off.</p>
<p class="para">Hopper fell from the air, landing gracefully on the ground. <span class="italic1">Always be ready,</span> the wolf sent. <span class="italic1">Always, but especially when you move.</span> An image of a careful wolf, testing the air before moving out into an open pasture.</p>
<p class="para">“I understand.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">But do not come too strongly,</span> Hopper chided.</p>
<p class="para">Immediately, Perrin forced himself to remember Faile and the place where he slept. His home. He…faded slightly. His skin didn’t grow translucent, and the wolf dream stayed the same, but he felt more exposed.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Good,</span> Hopper sent. <span class="italic1">Always ready, but never holding on too strong. Like carrying a pup in your jaws.</span></p>
<p class="para">“That’s not going to be an easy balance,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para">Hopper gave a slightly confused scent. Of course it was difficult.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin smiled. “What now?”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Running,</span> Hopper sent. <span class="italic1">Then more practice.</span></p>
<p class="para">The wolf dashed away, zipping in a blur of gray and silver off toward the road. Perrin followed. He sensed determination from Hopper—a scent that was oddly similar to the way Tam smelled when training the refugees to fight. That made Perrin smile.</p>
<p class="para">They ran down the road, and Perrin practiced the balance of not being in the dream too strongly, yet being ready to solidify his sense of <span class="italic1">self</span> at any moment. Occasionally Hopper would attack him, trying to throw him from the wolf dream. They continued until Hopper—suddenly—stopped running.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin took a few extra steps, surging ahead of the wolf, before stopping. There was something <span class="italic1">in front</span> of him. A translucent violet wall that cut directly through the roadway. It extended up into the sky and distantly to both the right and the left.</p>
<p class="para">“Hopper?” Perrin asked. “What is this?”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Wrongness,</span> Hopper sent. <span class="italic1">It should not be here.</span> The wolf smelled angry.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin stepped forward and raised a hand toward the surface, but hesitated. It looked like glass. He’d never seen anything like this in the wolf dream. Might it be like the bubbles of evil? He looked up at the sky.</p>
<p class="para">The wall flashed suddenly and was gone. Perrin blinked, stumbling back. He glanced at Hopper. The wolf sat on his haunches, staring at the place where the wall had been. <span class="italic1">Come, Young Bull,</span> the wolf finally sent, standing. <span class="italic1">We will practice in another place.</span></p>
<p class="para">He loped away. Perrin looked back down the road. Whatever the wall had been, it had left no visible sign of its existence.</p>
<p class="para">Troubled, Perrin followed after Hopper.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">“Burn me, where are those archers!” Rodel Ituralde climbed up to the top of the hillside. “I wanted them formed up on the forward towers an hour ago to relieve the crossbowmen!”</p>
<p class="para">Before him, the battle clanged and screamed and grunted and thumped and roared. A band of Trollocs had surged across the river, crossing on ford rafts or a crude floating bridge fashioned from log rafts. Trollocs <span class="italic1">hated</span> crossing water. It took a lot to get them over.</p>
<p class="para">Which was why this fortification was so useful. The hillside sloped directly down to the only ford of reasonable size in leagues. To the north, Trollocs boiled through a pass out of the Blight and ran right into the River Arinelle. When they could be forced across, they faced the hillside, which had been dug with trenches, piled with bulwarks and set with archer towers at the top. There was no way to reach the city of Maradon from the Blight except by passing over this hill.</p>
<p class="para">It was an ideal position for holding back a much larger force, but even the best fortifications could be overrun, particularly when your men were tired from weeks of fighting. The Trollocs had crossed and fought their way up the slope under a hail of arrows, falling into the trenches, having difficulty surmounting the high bulwarks.</p>
<p class="para">The hillside had a flat area at the top, where Ituralde had his command position, in the upper camp. He called orders as he looked down on the woven mass of trenches, bulwarks and towers. The Trollocs were dying to pikemen behind one of the bulwarks. Ituralde watched until the last Trolloc—an enormous, ram-faced beast—roared and died with three pikes in its gut.</p>
<p class="para">It looked as if another surge was coming, the Myrddraal driving another mass of Trollocs through the pass. Enough bodies had fallen in the river that it was clogged for the moment, running red, the carcasses providing a footing for those running up behind.</p>
<p class="para">“Archers!” Ituralde bellowed. “Where are those bloody—”</p>
<p class="para">A company of archers finally ran past, some of the reserves he’d held back. Most of them had the coppery skin of Domani, though there were a few stray Taraboners mixed in. They carried a wide variety of bows: narrow Domani longbows, serpentine Saldaean shortbows scavenged from guard posts or villages, even a few tall Two Rivers longbows.</p>
<p class="para">“Lidrin,” Ituralde called. The young, hard-eyed officer hurried across the hillside to him. Lidrin’s brown uniform was wrinkled and dirty at the knees, not because he was undisciplined, but because there were times when his men needed him more than his laundry did.</p>
<p class="centerImage1"><img src="../images/00577.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre31"/></p>
<p class="para">“Go with those archers to the towers,” Ituralde said. “Those Trollocs are going to try another push. I do <span class="italic1">not</span> want another fist breaking through to the top, hear me? If they seize our position and use it against us, I’m going to have a rotten morning.”</p>
<p class="para">Lidrin didn’t smile at the comment, as he once might have. He didn’t smile much at all anymore; usually only when he got to kill a Trolloc. He saluted, turning to jog after the archers.</p>
<p class="para">Ituralde turned and looked down the back side of the hill. The lower camp was set up there, in the shadow of the steep hillside. This hill had been a natural formation, once, but the Saldaeans had built it up over the years, with one long slope extending toward the river and a steeper one on the opposite side. In the lower camp, his troops could sleep and eat, and their supplies could be protected, all sheltered from enemy arrows by the steep hillside upon which Ituralde now stood.</p>
<p class="para">Both of his camps, upper and lower, were patchwork things. Some of the tents had been purchased from Saldaean villages, some were of Domani make, and dozens had been brought in by gateway from all over the land. A large number of them were enormous Cairhienin things with striped patterns. They kept the rain off his men, and that was enough.</p>
<p class="para">The Saldaeans certainly knew how to build fortifications. If only Ituralde had been able to persuade them to leave their hiding place in the city of Maradon and come help.</p>
<p class="para">“Now,” Ituralde said, “where in—”</p>
<p class="para">He cut off as something darkened the sky. He barely had time to curse and duck away as a group of large objects rained down, arcing high to fall on the upper camp, eliciting howls of pain and confusion. Those weren’t boulders: they were <span class="italic1">corpses</span>. The hulking bodies of dead Trollocs. The Shadowspawn army had finally set up their trebuchets.</p>
<p class="para">A part of Ituralde was impressed that he’d driven them to it. The siege equipment had undoubtedly been brought to assault Maradon, which was a little to the south. Setting up the trebuchets across the ford to assault Ituralde’s lines instead not only would slow the Shadowspawn, but would expose their trebuchets to his counterfire.</p>
<p class="para">He hadn’t expected them to hurl carcasses. He cursed as the sky darkened again, more bodies falling, knocking down tents, crushing soldiers.</p>
<p class="para">“Healers!” Ituralde bellowed. “Where are those Asha’man?” He’d pushed the Asha’man hard, since this siege had begun. To the brink of exhaustion. Now he held them back, using them only when Trolloc assaults got too close to the upper camp.</p>
<p class="para">“Sir!” A young messenger with dirt under his fingernails scrambled up from the front lines. His Domani face was ashen, and he was still too young to grow a proper mustache. “Captain Finsas reports the Shadowspawn army moving trebuchets into range. There are sixteen by his count.”</p>
<p class="para">“Let Captain Finsas know that his bloody timing could be better,” Ituralde growled.</p>
<p class="para">“I’m sorry, my Lord. They rolled them down through the pass before we figured out what was going on. The initial volley hit our watchpost. Lord Finsas himself was wounded.”</p>
<p class="para">Ituralde nodded; Rajabi was arriving to take command of the upper camp and organize the wounded. Below, a lot of bodies had hit the lower camp, too. The trebuchets could get the height and range to launch over the hill and fall down on his men in their previously sheltered area. He’d have to pull the lower camp back, farther across the plain toward Maradon, which would delay response times. Bloody ashes.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">I never used to swear this much,</span> Ituralde thought. It was that boy, the Dragon Reborn. Rand al’Thor had given Ituralde promises, some spoken, some implied. Promises to protect Arad Doman from the Seanchan. Promises that Ituralde could live, rather than die trapped by the Seanchan. Promises to give him something to do, something important, something vital. Something impossible.</p>
<p class="para">Hold back the Shadow. Fight until help arrived.</p>
<p class="para">The sky darkened again, and Ituralde ducked into the command pavilion, which had a wooden roof as a precaution against siege weapons. He’d feared sprayshot of smaller rocks, not carcasses. The men scattered to help pull the wounded down to the relative safety of the lower camp, and from there across the plain toward Maradon. Rajabi led the effort. The lumbering man had a neck as thick as a ten-year-grown ash and arms nearly as wide. He now hobbled as he walked, his left leg hurt in the fighting and amputated beneath the knee. Aes Sedai had Healed him as best he could, and he walked on a peg. He’d refused to retire through gateways with the badly injured, and Ituralde hadn’t forced him. You didn’t throw away a good officer because of one wound.</p>
<p class="para">A young officer winced as a bloated carcass thumped against the top of the pavilion. The officer—Zhell—didn’t have the coppery skin of a Domani, though he wore a very Domani mustache and a beauty mark on his cheek in the shape of an arrow.</p>
<p class="para">They could not hold against Trollocs here for much longer, not with the numbers they were fielding. Ituralde would have to fall back, point by point, farther into Saldaea, farther toward Arad Doman. Odd, how he was always retreating toward his homeland. First from the south, now from the northeast.</p>
<p class="para">Arad Doman would be crushed between the Seanchan and the Trollocs. <span class="italic1">You’d better keep your word, boy.</span></p>
<p class="para">He couldn’t retreat into Maradon, unfortunately. The Saldaeans there had made it quite clear they considered Ituralde—and the Dragon Reborn—to be invaders. Bloody fools. At least he had a chance to destroy those siege engines.</p>
<p class="para">Another body hit the top of the command pavilion, but the roof held. From the stink—and, in some cases, splash—of those deceased Trollocs, they’d not chosen the newly dead for this assault. Confident that his officers were seeing to their duties—now was not the time to interfere—Ituralde clasped his hands behind him. Seeing him, soldiers both inside and out of the pavilion stood a little straighter. The best of plans lasted only until the first arrow hit, but a determined, unyielding commander could bring order to chaos by the way he held himself.</p>
<p class="para">Overhead, the storm boiled, clouds of silver and black like a blackened pot hanging above a cook fire, bits of steel shining through at the edges of the crusted soot. It was unnatural. Let his men see that he did not fear it, even when it hailed corpses upon them.</p>
<p class="para">Wounded were carried away, and men in the lower camp began to break it down, preparing to move it farther back. He kept his archers and crossbowmen firing, pikemen ready along the bulwarks. He had a sizable cavalry, but couldn’t use them here.</p>
<p class="para">Those trebuchets, if left alone, would wear his men down with boulders and sprayshot—but Ituralde intended to see them burned first, using an Asha’man or a strike force with flaming arrows through a gateway.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">If only I could retreat into Maradon.</span> But the Saldaean lord there wouldn’t let him in; if Ituralde fell back to the city, he’d get smashed against those walls by the Trollocs.</p>
<p class="para">Bloody, bloody fools. What kind of idiots denied men refuge when an army of Shadowspawn was knocking on their gates?</p>
<p class="para">“I want damage assessments,” Ituralde said to Lieutenant Nils. “Prepare the archers for an attack on those siege engines, and bring two of the Asha’man who are on duty. Tell Captain Creedin to watch that Trolloc assault across the ford. They’ll redouble their efforts following this barrage, as they’ll presume us disordered.”</p>
<p class="para">The young man nodded and hastened off as Rajabi limped into the pavilion, rubbing his broad chin. “You guessed right again about those trebuchets. They <span class="italic1">did</span> set them up to attack us.”</p>
<p class="para">“I try to always guess right,” Ituralde said. “When I don’t, we lose.”</p>
<p class="para">Rajabi grunted. Overhead, that storm boiled. In the distance, Ituralde could hear Trollocs calling. War drums beating. Men shouting.</p>
<p class="para">“Something’s wrong,” Ituralde said.</p>
<p class="para">“This whole bloody war is wrong,” Rajabi said. “We shouldn’t be here; it should be the Saldaeans. Their whole army, not only the few horsemen the Lord Dragon gave us.”</p>
<p class="para">“More than that,” Ituralde said, scanning the sky. “Why carcasses, Rajabi?”</p>
<p class="para">“To demoralize us.”</p>
<p class="para">It was a not-unheard-of tactic. But the first volleys? Why not use stones when they’d do the most damage, and then move to bodies once surprise had been expended? The Trollocs hadn’t a mind for tactics, but the Fades…they could be crafty. He’d learned that firsthand.</p>
<p class="para">As Ituralde stared at the sky, another massive volley fell, as if spawned by the dark clouds. Light, where had they gotten that many trebuchets? Enough to throw hundreds of dead bodies.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">There are sixteen by his count,</span> the boy had said. Not nearly enough. Were some of those carcasses falling too evenly?</p>
<p class="para">It hit him like a burst of frozen rain. Those clever bloody monsters!</p>
<p class="para">“Archers!” Ituralde screamed. “Archers, watch the skies! Those aren’t bodies!”</p>
<p class="para">It was too late. As he yelled, the Draghkar unfurled their wings; well over half of the “carcasses” in this volley were living Shadowspawn, hiding among the falling bodies. After the first Draghkar attack on his army a few days back, he’d left archers on permanent rotation watching the skies day and night.</p>
<p class="para">But the archers didn’t have orders to fire on falling bodies. Ituralde continued to bellow as he leaped out of the pavilion and whipped his sword from its scabbard. The upper camp became chaos as Draghkar dropped amid the soldiers. A large number of them fell around the command pavilion, their too-large black eyes shining, drawing men toward them with their sweet songs.</p>
<p class="para">Ituralde screamed as loud as he could, filling his ears with the sound of his own voice. One of the beasts came for him, but his yell prevented him from hearing its croon. It looked surprised—as surprised as something so inhuman could look—as he stumbled toward it, pretending to be drawn, then struck an expert thrust through its neck. Dark blood dribbled down across milky white skin as Ituralde yanked his blade free, still screaming.</p>
<p class="para">He saw Rajabi stumble and fall to the ground as one of the Shadowspawn leaped on him. Ituralde couldn’t go to him—he was confronted by another of the monsters himself. In a blessed moment, he noticed balls of fire striking down Draghkar in the air—the Asha’man.</p>
<p class="para">But at the same time, in the distance, he heard the war drums grow louder. As he’d predicted, the churning force of Trollocs would be striking across the ford with as much strength as they ever had. Light, but sometimes he hated being right.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">You’d better keep your promise to send me help, boy,</span> Ituralde thought as he fought the second Draghkar, his screaming growing hoarse. <span class="italic1">Light, but you’d better!</span></p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Faile strode through Perrin’s camp, the air ringing with chattering voices, grunts of exertion and calls of men giving orders. Perrin had sent one last request to the Whitecloaks for parley, and there had been no reply yet.</p>
<p class="para">Faile felt refreshed. She’d spent the entire night nuzzled against Perrin atop their hill. She’d brought plenty of bedding and blankets. In some ways, the grassy hilltop had been more comfortable than their tent.</p>
<p class="para">The scouts had returned from Cairhien this morning; their report would come soon. For now, Faile had bathed and eaten.</p>
<p class="para">It was time to do something about Berelain.</p>
<p class="para">She crossed the trampled grass toward the Mayener section of camp, feeling her anger rise. Berelain had gone too far. Perrin claimed that the rumors came from Berelain’s maids, not the woman herself, but Faile saw the truth. The First was a master of manipulating and controlling rumor. That was one of the best ways to rule from a position of relative weakness. The First did so in Mayene, and she did the same here in camp, where Faile was the stronger party as Perrin’s wife.</p>
<p class="para">A pair of Winged Guards stood at the entrance to the Mayener section, their breastplates painted crimson, winged helmets shaped like pots and extending down the backs of their necks. They stood up taller as Faile neared, holding lances that were mostly ornamental, pennons flapping with the golden hawk in flight stenciled on their blue lengths.</p>
<p class="para">Faile had to crane to meet their eyes. “Escort me to your lady,” she ordered.</p>
<p class="para">The guards nodded, one holding up a gauntleted hand and waving for two other men from inside the camp to take up the watch. “We were told to expect you,” the guard told Faile in a deep voice.</p>
<p class="para">Faile raised an eyebrow. “Today?”</p>
<p class="para">“No. The First simply said that should you come, you were to be obeyed.”</p>
<p class="para">“Of course I’m to be obeyed. This is my husband’s camp.”</p>
<p class="para">The guards did not argue with her, though they probably disagreed. Berelain had been sent to accompany Perrin, but he had not been given express command over her or her troops.</p>
<p class="para">Faile followed the men. The ground was, by a miracle, actually starting to dry out. Faile had told Perrin that she wasn’t bothered by the rumors, but she <span class="italic1">was</span> frustrated by Berelain’s boldness. <span class="italic1">That woman,</span> Faile thought. <span class="italic1">How dare she—</span></p>
<p class="para">No. No, Faile couldn’t continue down that path. A good shouting match would make her feel better, but it would reinforce the rumors. What else would people surmise if they saw her stalk to the First’s tent, then scream at her? Faile had to be calm. That would be difficult.</p>
<p class="para">The Mayener camp was arranged with lines of men radiating from a central tent like spokes on a wheel. The Winged Guards didn’t have tents—those were with Master Gill—but there was a very orderly arrangement to the groupings. They almost seemed <span class="italic1">too</span> level, the folded blankets, the piles of lances, the horse poles and the periodic firepits. Berelain’s central pavilion was lavender and maroon—salvage from Malden. Faile maintained her composure as the two towering guards led her up to the tent. One knocked on the post outside for permission to enter.</p>
<p class="para">Berelain’s tranquil voice responded, and the guard pushed back the entrance flap for Faile. As she moved to enter, rustling inside made her step back, and Annoura came out. The Aes Sedai nodded to Faile, the overlapping braids around her face swinging. She seemed displeased; she hadn’t regained her mistress’s favor yet.</p>
<p class="para">Faile took a deep breath, then stepped into the pavilion. It was cool inside. The floor was covered with a maroon and green rug of a twisting ivy pattern. Though the pavilion looked empty without Berelain’s usual travel furniture, she did have a pair of sturdy oak chairs and a light table from Malden.</p>
<p class="para">The First rose. “Lady Faile,” she said calmly. Today, she wore the diadem of Mayene. The thin crown had a simple grandeur about it, unornamented save for the golden hawk taking flight as if leaping toward the sunlight streaming in patches through the tent ceiling. Flaps had been removed there to let in the light. The First’s dress was gold and green, a very simple belt at her waist, the neckline plunging.</p>
<p class="para">Faile sat in one of the chairs. This conversation was dangerous; it could lead to disaster. But it had to be done.</p>
<p class="para">“I trust you are well?” Berelain said. “The rains of the last few days have not been overly taxing?”</p>
<p class="para">“The rains have been dreadful, Berelain,” Faile said. “But I’m not here to talk about them.”</p>
<p class="para">Berelain pursed perfect lips. Light, but the woman was beautiful! Faile felt downright dingy by comparison, her nose too large, her bosom too small. Her voice wasn’t nearly as melodic as Berelain’s. Why had the Creator made people as perfect as Berelain? Was it mockery of the rest of them?</p>
<p class="para">But Perrin didn’t love Berelain. He loved Faile. <span class="italic1">Remember that.</span></p>
<p class="para">“Very well,” Berelain said. “I assumed this discussion would come. Let me promise you that the rumors are absolutely false; nothing inappropriate happened between myself and your husband.”</p>
<p class="para">“He has told me that already,” Faile said, “and I trust his word over yours.”</p>
<p class="para">This made Berelain frown. She was a master of political interactions, possessing a skill and subtlety that Faile envied. Despite her youth, Berelain had kept her tiny city-state free from the much larger and powerful Tear. Faile could only guess how much juggling, political double-dealing and sheer cleverness that must have required.</p>
<p class="para">“So why have you come to me?” Berelain asked, sitting down. “If your heart is at ease, then there is no problem.”</p>
<p class="para">“We both know that whether or not you slept with my husband is not an issue here,” Faile said, and Berelain’s eyes widened. “It isn’t what happened, but what is <span class="italic1">presumed</span>, that angers me.”</p>
<p class="para">“Rumors can be found in any place where people are gathered,” Berelain said. “Particularly where men gossip.”</p>
<p class="para">“Such strong, persistent rumors are unlikely to have happened without encouragement,” Faile said. “Now everyone in the camp—including the refugees sworn to me—assumes that you bedded my husband while I was away. This not only makes me look like a fool, but casts a shadow upon Perrin’s honor. He cannot lead if people take him for the type of man who will run to the arms of another woman the moment his wife is away.”</p>
<p class="para">“Other rulers have overcome such rumors,” Berelain said, “and for many of them, the rumors weren’t unfounded. Monarchies survive infidelity.”</p>
<p class="para">“Perhaps in Illian or Tear,” Faile said, “but Saldaea expects better of its monarchs. As do the people of the Two Rivers. Perrin is <span class="italic1">not</span> like other rulers. The way his men look at him rips him apart inside.”</p>
<p class="para">“I think you underestimate him,” Berelain said. “He will overcome and he will learn to use rumor for his gain. That will make him stronger as a man and a ruler.”</p>
<p class="para">Faile studied the woman. “You don’t understand him at all, do you?”</p>
<p class="para">Berelain reacted as if she’d been slapped, pulling back. She obviously didn’t like the bluntness of this conversation. That might give Faile some slight advantage.</p>
<p class="para">“I understand men, Lady Faile,” Berelain said coldly. “And your husband is no exception. Since you have decided to be candid, I will return in kind. You were clever to take Aybara when you did, welding Saldaea to the Dragon Reborn, but do not think that he will remain yours without contest.”</p>
<p class="para">Faile took a deep breath. It was time to make her play. “Perrin’s reputation has been severely damaged by what you have done, my Lady First. For my own dishonor, I might have been able to forgive you. But not for his.”</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t see what can be done.”</p>
<p class="para">“I do,” Faile said. “And I’m pretty certain one of us is going to have to die.”</p>
<p class="para">Berelain remained impassive. “Excuse me?”</p>
<p class="para">“In the Borderlands, if a woman finds that another has been bedding her husband, she is given the option of knife combat.” That was true, though the tradition was an old one, rarely observed any longer. “The only way to clear my name is for you and me to fight.”</p>
<p class="para">“What would that prove?”</p>
<p class="para">“If nothing else, if you were dead, it would stop anyone from thinking that you are still sleeping with my husband behind my back.”</p>
<p class="para">“Are you actually threatening me in my own tent?”</p>
<p class="para">“This is not a threat,” Faile said, remaining firm. Light, she hoped this went the right way. “This is a challenge.”</p>
<p class="para">Berelain studied her, eyes calculating. “I will make a public statement. I will publicly chastise my maids for their rumors, and will tell the camp that nothing happened.”</p>
<p class="para">“Do you really think that would stop the rumors? You didn’t object to them before my return; that is seen as proof. And, of course, now you would be <span class="italic1">expected</span> to act as if nothing happened.”</p>
<p class="para">“You can’t be serious about this…challenge.”</p>
<p class="para">“In regards to my husband’s honor, Berelain, I am <span class="italic1">always</span> serious.” She met the woman’s eyes, and saw concern there. Berelain didn’t want to fight her. And, of course, Faile didn’t want to fight Berelain, and not just because she wasn’t certain if she could win or not. Though she <span class="italic1">had</span> always wanted to get revenge on the First for that time when Berelain had taken her knife from her.</p>
<p class="para">“I will make the challenge formally this evening, before the entire camp,” Faile said, keeping her voice even. “You will have one day to respond or leave.”</p>
<p class="para">“I will not be a party to this foolishness.”</p>
<p class="para">“You already are,” Faile said, rising. “This is what you set in motion the moment you let those rumors begin.”</p>
<p class="para">Faile turned to walk from the tent. She had to work hard to hide her nervousness. Had Berelain seen how her brow prickled with sweat? Faile felt as if she walked on the very edge of a sword. Should word of this challenge get to Perrin, he would be furious. She had to hope that—</p>
<p class="para">“Lady Faile,” Berelain said from behind. The First’s voice was edged with concern. “Surely we can come to another accommodation. Do not force this.”</p>
<p class="para">Faile stopped, heart thumping. She turned back. The First looked genuinely worried. Yes, she believed that Faile was bloodthirsty enough to make this challenge.</p>
<p class="para">“I want you out of Perrin’s life, Berelain,” Faile said. “I will have that, one way or another.”</p>
<p class="para">“You wish me to leave?” Berelain asked. “The tasks the Lord Dragon gave me are finished. I suppose I could take my men and march another direction.”</p>
<p class="para">No, Faile didn’t want her to go. The disappearance of her troops would be a blow, in the face of that looming Whitecloak army. And Perrin would have need of the Winged Guards again, Faile suspected.</p>
<p class="para">“No,” Faile said. “Leaving will do nothing for the rumors, Berelain.”</p>
<p class="para">“It will do as much as killing me would,” the woman said dryly. “If we fight, and you somehow managed to kill me, all that would be said is that you discovered your husband’s infidelity and became enraged. I fail to see how that would help your position. It would only <span class="italic1">encourage</span> the rumors.”</p>
<p class="para">“You see my problem, then,” Faile said, letting her exasperation show through. “There seems to be <span class="italic1">no</span> way to be rid of these rumors.”</p>
<p class="para">Berelain studied her. The woman had once promised she would take Perrin. Had all but vowed it. She seemed to have backed off on that, in part, recently. And her eyes showed hints of worry.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">She realizes that she let this go too far,</span> Faile thought, understanding. Of course. Berelain hadn’t expected Faile to return from Malden. That was why she’d made such a bold move.</p>
<p class="para">Now she realized she’d overextended herself. And she legitimately thought Faile unhinged enough to duel her in public.</p>
<p class="para">“I never wanted this, Berelain,” Faile said, walking back into the tent. “And neither did Perrin. Your attentions are an annoyance to us both.”</p>
<p class="para">“Your husband did little to dissuade me,” Berelain said, arms folded. “During your absence, there were points where he <span class="italic1">directly</span> encouraged me.”</p>
<p class="para">“You understand him so little, Berelain.” It was amazing how the woman could be so blind while being so clever in other ways.</p>
<p class="para">“So you claim,” Berelain said.</p>
<p class="para">“You have two choices right now, Berelain,” Faile said, stepping up to her. “You can fight me, and one of us will die. You’re right, that wouldn’t end the rumors. But it <span class="italic1">would</span> end your chances at Perrin. Either you’d be dead, or you’d be the woman who killed his wife.</p>
<p class="para">“Your other choice,” Faile said, meeting Berelain’s eyes, “is to come up with a way to destroy these rumors once and for all. You caused this mess. You will fix it.”</p>
<p class="para">And there was her gamble. Faile couldn’t think of a way out of the situation, but Berelain was <span class="italic1">much</span> more accomplished in this regard than she was. So Faile came, prepared to manipulate Berelain into thinking she was ready to do something unreasonable. Then let the woman’s impressive political acumen attack the situation.</p>
<p class="para">Would it work?</p>
<p class="para">Faile met Berelain’s eyes, and allowed herself to feel her anger. Her <span class="italic1">outrage</span> at what had happened. She was being beaten, frozen and humiliated by their common enemy. And during that, Berelain had the <span class="italic1">gall</span> to do something like this?</p>
<p class="para">She held the First’s eyes. No, Faile did not have as much political experience as Berelain. But she had something the woman didn’t. She loved Perrin. Deeply, truly. She would do <span class="italic1">anything</span> to keep him from being hurt.</p>
<p class="para">The First studied her. “Very well,” she said. “So be it. Be proud of yourself, Faile. It is…rare that I take myself off a prize I have long desired.”</p>
<p class="para">“You haven’t said how we could get rid of the rumors.”</p>
<p class="para">“There may be a method,” Berelain said. “But it will be distasteful.”</p>
<p class="para">Faile raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="para">“We will need to be seen as friends,” Berelain explained. “Fighting, being at odds, this will fuel the rumors. But if we are seen spending time with one another, it will disarm them. That, mixed with a formal renunciation on my part of the rumors, will likely be enough.”</p>
<p class="para">Faile sat down in the chair she had been using earlier. Friends? She <span class="italic1">detested</span> this woman.</p>
<p class="para">“It would have to be a believable act,” Berelain said, rising and walking over to the serving stand at the corner of the tent. She poured herself some chilled wine. “Only that would work.”</p>
<p class="para">“You’ll find another man, as well,” Faile said. “Someone you can give your attentions to, for a time at least. To prove that you are not interested in Perrin.”</p>
<p class="para">Berelain raised the cup. “Yes,” she said. “I suspect that would help too. Can you put on such an act, Faile ni Bashere t’Aybara?”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">You believed I was ready to kill you over this, didn’t you,</span> Faile thought. “I promise it.”</p>
<p class="para">Berelain paused, winecup halfway to her lips. Then she smiled, and drank. “We shall see, then,” she said, lowering the cup, “what comes of this.”</p>
