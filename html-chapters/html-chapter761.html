<p class="ct"><span class="epub-i">A Shard of a Moment</span></p>
<p class="tni">Birgitte dashed through the forest, accompanied by a group of thirty Aiel, all with bows out. They made sound—they couldn’t help but make sound—but the Aiel made less than they should. They would leap up onto fallen logs and run deftly along them or would find stones to step upon. They would writhe out of the way of hanging branches, ducking, twisting, moving.</p>
<p class="tx">“Here,” she said in a hushed tone, rounding the side of a broken hill. Fortunately, the cave was still there, overgrown with vines, a small creek running past it. The Aiel ducked in, the water removing any scent of their passage.</p>
<p class="tx">Two of the men continued down the game trail, now moving much more loudly, scraping against every branch they passed. Birgitte joined the ones hiding in the cavern. It was dark inside and smelled of mold and earth.</p>
<p class="tx">Had she hidden in this cave, centuries ago when she’d lived in these woods as a bandit? She didn’t know. She rarely remembered any of her past lives, sometimes only fleeting memories of the in-between years during her life in the World of Dreams before being brought into this world unnaturally by Moghedien.</p>
<p class="tx">She considered that with sickness. It was all right to be reborn, fresh and new. But to have her memories—her very sense of self—ripped away? If she lost her memories of her time in the World of Dreams, would she forget Gaidal completely? Would she forget herself?</p>
<p class="tx">She clenched her teeth. <span class="epub-i1">It’s the Last Battle, fool woman,</span> she thought. <span class="epub-i1">Who cares about that?</span></p>
<p class="tx">But she did. A question had begun to haunt her. What if, in being cast out of the World of Dreams, Birgitte had been broken from the Horn? She didn’t know if it was possible. She no longer remembered enough to tell.</p>
<p class="tx">But if she had, she’d lose Gaidal forever.</p>
<p class="tx">Outside, leaves crunched, twigs cracking. The clatter was so loud, she would have sworn that a thousand soldiers were marching past—though she knew the fist of Trollocs was only fifty strong. Still, fifty had her band outnumbered. She didn’t worry. Though she complained to Elayne that she didn’t know much about warfare, this hiding in a forest with a team of well-trained companions … this she’d done before. Dozens of times. Perhaps hundreds, though her memories were so fuzzy, she couldn’t say for certain.</p>
<p class="tx">When the Trollocs were nearly all the way past, she and her Aiel burst from cover. The brutes had started down the false trail made by the two Aielmen earlier, and Birgitte attacked them from behind, downing a number of Trollocs with arrows before the rest were able to react.</p>
<p class="tx">Trollocs did not die easily. They could often take two or three arrows before slowing. Well, that only happened when you missed the eyes or the throat. She never did. Monster after monster dropped to her bow. The Trollocs had begun downslope of the cave, which meant every one she or the Aiel killed was another corpse the others had to try to climb over to reach her.</p>
<p class="tx">Fifty became thirty in mere seconds. As that thirty rushed upward, half of the Aiel pulled out spears and engaged them while Birgitte and the others took a few steps downslope and flanked the Trollocs.</p>
<p class="tx">Twenty became ten, who tried to flee. Despite the wooded landscape, they were easy to pick off—though it meant hitting them in the legs or back of the neck, taking them down so that spears could finish them off.</p>
<p class="tx">Ten of the Aiel saw to the Trollocs, sticking a spear in each one to make certain it was dead. Others gathered arrows. Birgitte pointed to Nichil and Ludin, two of the Aiel, and they joined her to scout the area.</p>
<p class="tx">Her steps felt familiar, these woods felt familiar. Not just because of past lives she could no longer remember. During her centuries spent living in the World of Dreams, she and Gaidal had spent many a year in these forests. She remembered his caress upon her cheek. Her neck.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">I can’t lose this,</span> she thought, fighting down panic. <span class="epub-i1">Light, I can’t. Please</span> … She didn’t know what was happening to her. She could remember something, a faint discussion about … about what? She had lost it. People couldn’t be unbound from the Horn, could they? Hawkwing might know. She’d have to ask him. Unless she had already?</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Burn me!</span></p>
<p class="tx">Movement in the forest stopped her cold. She crouched down next to a rock, bow out in front of her. Underbrush crackled close at hand. Nichil and Ludin had vanished at the first sound. Light, but they were good. It took her a moment to pick them out hiding nearby.</p>
<p class="tx">She raised a finger, pointed at herself, then pointed before her. She would scout; they would cover her.</p>
<p class="tx">Birgitte moved silently. She’d show these Aiel that they weren’t the only ones who knew how to avoid detection. Besides, these were <span class="epub-i1">her</span> woods. She wouldn’t be shown up by a bunch of desert folk.</p>
<p class="tx">She moved stealthily, avoiding thickets of withered thorn bushes. Were there more of those around of late? They seemed to be one of the only plants that hadn’t died off completely. The ground smelled stale in a way that no forest should, though that was overpowered by the stench of death and rot. She passed another group of fallen Trollocs. The blood on them was dry. They were several days dead.</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne ordered her forces to bring back their dead. Thousands upon thousands of Trollocs moved through these woods like crawling beetles. Elayne wanted them to find only their own dead, hoping it would give them reason to fear.</p>
<p class="tx">Birgitte moved toward the sounds. She saw large shadows approaching in the dim light. Trollocs, sniffing at the air.</p>
<p class="tx">The creatures continued to press through the woods. They were forced to avoid the roads where an ambush of dragons could prove deadly. Elayne’s plan called for teams like the one Birgitte led to hack away at the Trollocs, leading groups of them off into the woods, whittling down their numbers.</p>
<p class="tx">This group was far too big for her team to take, unfortunately. Birgitte withdrew, waving for the Aiel to follow, and slipped quietly back toward camp.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">That night, following his failure with Lan’s army, Rand fled to his dreams.</p>
<p class="tx">He sought out his valley of peace, appearing amid a grove of wild cherry trees in full bloom, their perfume lacing the air. With those beautiful pink-throated white blossoms, the trees almost looked aflame.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand wore simple Two Rivers clothing. After months in a king’s garments of brilliant colors and soft textures, the loose wool trousers and linen felt very comfortable. He placed sturdy boots on his feet, like those he’d worn growing up. They fit him in a way that no new boot, no matter how well made, ever could.</p>
<p class="tx">He wasn’t allowed old boots any longer. If his boots showed a hint of wear, one servant or another made them vanish.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand stood up in the dream hills and made himself a walking staff. He then began to walk upward through the mountains. This wasn’t a real place, not any longer. He’d crafted it from memory and desire, somehow mixing both familiarity and a sense of exploration. It smelled fresh, of overturned leaves and sap. Animals moved in the underbrush. A hawk cried somewhere distant.</p>
<p class="tx">Lews Therin had known how to create dreamshards like this. Though he had not been a Dreamer, most Aes Sedai of that era had made use of <span class="epub-i1">Tel’aran’rhiod</span> in one way or another. One thing they learned was how to slice out a dream for themselves, a haven within their own mind, more controlled than regular dreams. They learned how to enter a fragment like this while meditating, somehow giving the body rest as real as sleep.</p>
<p class="tx">Lews Therin had known these things, and more. How to reach into someone’s mind if they entered his dreamshard. How to tell if someone else had invaded his dreams. How to expose his dreams to others. Lews Therin had liked to <span class="epub-i1">know</span> things, like a traveler who wanted to have one of everything useful in his rucksack.</p>
<p class="tx">Lews Therin had rarely used these tools. He’d left them stored on a back shelf in his mind, gathering dust. Would things have gone differently if he’d taken time, each night, to wander a peaceful valley such as this? Rand didn’t know. And, truth be told, this valley was no longer safe. He passed a deep cavern to his left. He had not put it there. Another attempt by Moridin to draw him? Rand passed it by without looking.</p>
<p class="tx">The forest didn’t seem as alive as it had moments ago. Rand kept walking, trying to enforce his will upon the land. He had not practiced that enough, however—so as he walked, the forest grayed, looking washed out.</p>
<p class="tx">The cavern came again. Rand stopped at its mouth. Cold, humid air blew out over him, chilling his skin, smelling of fungus. Rand cast aside his walking staff, then strode into the cavern. As he passed into darkness, he wove a globe of white-blue light and hung it beside his head. The glow reflected from the wet stone, shining on smooth knobs and clefts.</p>
<p class="tx">Panting echoed from deep within the cavern. It was followed by gasps. And … splashes. Rand walked forward, though by now he had guessed what this was. He had begun to wonder if she would try again.</p>
<p class="tx">He came to a small chamber, perhaps ten paces wide, at the end of the tunnel, where the stone sank down into a clear pool of water, perfectly circular. The blue depths seemed to extend downward forever.</p>
<p class="tx">A woman in a white dress struggled to stay afloat in the center of it. The fabric of her dress rippled in the water, forming a circle. Her face and hair were wet. As Rand watched, she gasped and sank, flailing in the crystalline water.</p>
<p class="tx">She came up a moment later, gasping.</p>
<p class="tx">“Hello, Mierin,” Rand said softly. His hand formed into a fist. He would <span class="epub-i1">not</span> jump into that water to rescue her. This was a dreamshard. That pool could actually be water, but more likely it represented something else.</p>
<p class="tx">His arrival seemed to buoy her, and her vigorous thrashings became more effective. “Lews Therin,” she said, wiping her face with one hand, panting.</p>
<p class="tx">Light! Where was his peace? He felt like a child again, a boy who thought Baerlon the grandest city ever built. Yes, her face was different, but faces were no longer of much matter to him. She was still the same person.</p>
<p class="tx">Of all the Forsaken, only Lanfear had chosen her new name. She had always wanted one of those.</p>
<p class="tx">He remembered. He <span class="epub-i1">remembered</span>. Walking into grand parties with her on his arm. Her laughter over the music. Their nights alone. He had not wanted to remember making love to another woman, particularly not to one of the Forsaken, but he could not pick and choose what was in his mind.</p>
<p class="tx">Those memories mixed with his own, when he had desired her as the Lady Selene. A foolish, youthful lust. He no longer felt these things, but the memories of them remained.</p>
<p class="tx">“You can free me, Lews Therin,” Lanfear said. “He has claimed me. Must I beg? He has claimed me!”</p>
<p class="tx">“You pledged yourself to the Shadow, Mierin,” Rand said. “This is your reward. You expect pity from me?”</p>
<p class="tx">A dark something reached up and wrapped around her legs, yanking her down into the abyss again. Despite his words, Rand found himself stepping forward, as if to leap into the pool.</p>
<p class="tx">He held himself back. He finally felt like a whole person again, after a long fight. That gave him strength, but in his peace was a weakness—the weakness he had always feared. The weakness that Moiraine had rightfully spotted in him. The weakness of compassion.</p>
<p class="tx">He needed it. Like a helmet needed a hole through which to see. Both could be exploited. He admitted to himself that it was true.</p>
<p class="tx">Lanfear surfaced, sputtering, looking helpless. “Must I beg?” she said again.</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t think you are capable of it.”</p>
<p class="tx">She lowered her eyes. “… Please?” she whispered.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand’s insides twisted. He had fought through darkness himself in seeking the Light. He had given himself a second chance; should he not give one to another?</p>
<p class="tx">Light! He wavered, remembering what it had felt like in that moment seizing the True Power. That agony and that thrill, that power and that horror. Lanfear had given herself to the Dark One. But in a way, Rand had as well.</p>
<p class="tx">He looked into her eyes, searching them, <span class="epub-i1">knowing</span> them. Finally, Rand shook his head. “You’ve grown better at this kind of deception, Mierin. But not good enough.”</p>
<p class="tx">Her expression darkened. In a moment, the pool was gone, replaced by a stone floor. Lanfear sat there, cross-legged, in her silver-white dress. Wearing her new face, but still the same.</p>
<p class="tx">“So you <span class="epub-i1">are</span> back,” she said, sounding not entirely pleased. “Well, I am no longer forced to deal with a simple farmboy. That is some small blessing.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand snorted, entering the chamber. She <span class="epub-i1">was</span> still imprisoned—he could sense a darkening around her, like a dome of shadow, and he stayed outside of it. The pool, however—the act of drowning—had been mere theatrics. She was prideful, but was not above maintaining a weak front when the situation required it. If he’d been able to embrace Lews Therin’s memories earlier, Rand would never have been fooled so easily by her in the Waste.</p>
<p class="tx">“Then I shall address you not as a damsel in need of a hero,” Lanfear said, eyeing him as he walked around her prison, “but as an equal, seeking asylum.”</p>
<p class="tx">“An equal?” Rand said, laughing. “Since when have you ever considered <span class="epub-i1">anyone</span> your equal, Mierin?”</p>
<p class="tx">“You care nothing for my captivity?”</p>
<p class="tx">“It pains me,” Rand said, “but no more than it pained me when you swore yourself to the Shadow. Did you know I was there, when you revealed it? You did not see me, as I did not want to be seen, but I was watching. Light, Mierin, you swore to <span class="epub-i1">kill</span> me.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Did I mean it?” she asked, turning to look him in the eyes.</p>
<p class="tx">Had she?… No, she had not meant it. Not then. Lanfear did not kill people that she thought would be useful, and she had always considered him useful.</p>
<p class="tx">“We shared something special, once,” she said. “You were my—”</p>
<p class="tx">“I was an ornament to you!” Rand snapped. He breathed deeply, trying to calm himself. Light, but it was hard around her. “The past is done. I care nothing for it, and would gladly give you a second chance at the Light. Unfortunately, I <span class="epub-i1">know</span> you. You’re just doing it again. Playing us all, including the Dark One himself. You care nothing for the Light. You care only for power, Mierin. You honestly want me to believe that you’ve changed?”</p>
<p class="tx">“You do not know me so well as you think that you do,” she said, watching him as he rounded the perimeter of her prison. “You never did.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Then prove it to me,” Rand said, stopping. “Show me your mind, Mierin. Open it to me completely. Give me control over you here, in this place of mastered dreams. If your intentions are pure, I will free you.”</p>
<p class="tx">“What you ask is forbidden.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand laughed. “When has <span class="epub-i1">that</span> ever stopped you?”</p>
<p class="tx">She seemed to consider it; she must actually have been worried about her imprisonment. Once, she would have laughed at a suggestion such as this. Since this was, ostensibly, a place where he had complete control, if she gave him leave, he could strip her down, delve within her mind.</p>
<p class="tx">“I…” Lanfear said.</p>
<p class="tx">He stepped forward, right to the lip of the prison. That tremble in her voice … that felt real. The first genuine emotion from her.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Light,</span> he thought, searching her eyes. <span class="epub-i1">Is she actually going to do it?</span></p>
<p class="tx">“I cannot,” she said. “I cannot.” She said it the second time more softly.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand exhaled. He found his hand shaking. So close. So close to the Light, like a feral cat in the night, stalking back and forth before the fire-lit barn! He found himself angry, angrier than before. Always, she did this! Flirting with what was right, but always choosing her own path.</p>
<p class="tx">“I am done with you, Mierin,” Rand said, turning away and walking from the chamber. “Forever.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You mistake me!” she called out. “You have <span class="epub-i1">always</span> mistaken me! Would <span class="epub-i1">you</span> show yourself to someone in that way? I cannot do it. I have been slapped too many times by those I should have trusted. Betrayed by those who should have loved me.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You blame this on me?” Rand asked, spinning on his heel.</p>
<p class="tx">She did not look away. She sat, imperious, as if her prison were a throne.</p>
<p class="tx">“You really remember it that way, don’t you?” Rand said. “You think I betrayed you for her?”</p>
<p class="tx">“You said that you loved me.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I never said that. <span class="epub-i1">Never</span>. I could not. I did not know what love was. Centuries of life, and I never discovered it until I met her.” He hesitated, then continued, speaking so softly his voice did not echo in the small cavern. “You have never really felt it, have you? But of course. Who could you love? Your heart is claimed already, by the power you so strongly desire. There is no room left.”</p>
<p class="tx">Rand let go.</p>
<p class="tx">He let go as Lews Therin never had been able to. Even after discovering Ilyena, even after realizing how Lanfear had used him, he had held on to hatred and scorn. <span class="epub-i1">You expect me to pity you?</span> Rand had asked her.</p>
<p class="tx">He now felt just that. Pity for a woman who had never known love, a woman who would not let herself know it. Pity for a woman who could not choose a side other than her own.</p>
<p class="tx">“I…” she said softly.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand raised his hand, and then he opened himself to her. His intentions, his mind, his self appeared as a swirl of color, emotions and power around him.</p>
<p class="tx">Her eyes opened wide as the swirl played before her, like pictures on a wall. He could hold nothing back. She saw his motives, his desires, his wishes for mankind. She saw his intentions. To go to Shayol Ghul, to kill the Dark One. To leave a better world than he had the last time.</p>
<p class="tx">He did not fear revealing these things. He had touched the True Power, and so the Dark One knew his heart. There were no surprises here, at least nothing that <span class="epub-i1">should</span> have been a surprise.</p>
<p class="tx">Lanfear was surprised anyway. Her jaw dropped as she saw the truth—the truth that, down deep, it was not Lews Therin who made up Rand’s core. It was the sheepherder, raised by Tam. His lives played out in moments, his memories and feelings exposed.</p>
<p class="tx">Last, he showed her his love for Ilyena—like a glowing crystal, set upon a shelf and admired. Then his love for Min, Aviendha, Elayne. Like a burning bonfire, warming, comforting, passionate.</p>
<p class="tx">There was no love for Lanfear in what he exposed. Not a sliver. He had squelched Lews Therin’s loathing of her as well. And so, to him, she really was nothing.</p>
<p class="tx">She gasped.</p>
<p class="tx">The glow around Rand faded. “I’m sorry,” he said. “I really did mean it. I am finished with you, Mierin. Keep your head down during the storm to come. If I win this fight, you will no longer have reason to fear for your soul. There will be no one left to torment you.”</p>
<p class="tx">He turned from her again, and walked from the cave, leaving her silent.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Evening in the Braem Wood was accompanied by the scent of fires smoldering in their pits and the sounds of men groaning softly as they settled into uneasy sleep, swords ready at hand. An unnatural chill to the summer air.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin walked through the camp, among the men under his command. The fighting had been hard in these woods. His people were hurting the Trollocs, but Light, there always seemed to be more Shadowspawn to replace those that fell.</p>
<p class="tx">After seeing that his people were properly fed, that the watch had been set and the men knew what to do if awakened in the night by an assault of Shadowspawn, he went seeking the Aiel. The Wise Ones in particular. Nearly all of them had gathered to go with Rand when he marched on Shayol Ghul—for now, they waited his order—but a few had remained with Perrin, including Edarra.</p>
<p class="tx">She and the other Wise Ones did not march at his command. And yet, like Gaul, they stayed with him when their fellows went elsewhere. Perrin had not asked them why. He didn’t really care why. Having them with him was useful, and he was grateful.</p>
<p class="tx">The Aiel let him pass their perimeter. He found Edarra sitting beside a fire, well rimmed with stones to prevent the chance of a stray spark escaping. These woods, dry as they were, could go up easier than a barn full of last harvest’s hay.</p>
<p class="tx">She glanced at Perrin as he settled down near her. The Aiel looked young but smelled of patience, inquisitiveness and control. Wisdom. She did not ask why Perrin had come to her. She waited for him to speak.</p>
<p class="tx">“Are you a dreamwalker?” Perrin asked.</p>
<p class="tx">She studied him in the night; he had the distinct impression this was not a question a man—or an outsider—was supposed to ask.</p>
<p class="tx">He was surprised, then, when she answered.</p>
<p class="tx">“No.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Do you know much of it?” Perrin asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“Some.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I need to know of a way to enter the World of Dreams physically. Not just in my dreams, but in my real body. Have you heard of such a thing?”</p>
<p class="tx">She inhaled sharply. “Do not think of that, Perrin Aybara. It is evil.”</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin frowned. Strength in the wolf dream—in <span class="epub-i1">Tel’aran’rhiod</span>—was a delicate thing. The more strongly Perrin put himself into the dream—the more solidly <span class="epub-i1">there</span> he was—the easier he found it to change things there, manipulate that world.</p>
<p class="tx">That came at a risk, however. Going into the dream too strongly, he risked cutting himself off from his sleeping body in the real world.</p>
<p class="tx">That apparently didn’t bother Slayer. Slayer was strong there, so <span class="epub-i1">very</span> strong; the man was in the dream physically. Perrin was increasingly sure of it.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Our contest will not end,</span> Perrin thought, <span class="epub-i1">until you are the prey, Slayer. Hunter of wolves. I</span> will <span class="epub-i1">end you.</span></p>
<p class="tx">“In many ways,” Edarra muttered, looking at him, “you are still a child, for all the honor you have found.” Perrin had grown accustomed to—though not fond of—women who looked not a year or two older than he addressing him so. “None of the dreamwalkers will teach you this thing. It is evil.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Why is it evil?” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="tx">“To enter into the world of dreams in the flesh costs you part of what makes you human. What’s more, if you die while in that place—and you are in the flesh—it can make you die forever. No more rebirth, Perrin Aybara. Your thread in the Pattern could end forever, you yourself destroyed. This is not a thing you should contemplate.”</p>
<p class="tx">“The servants of the Shadow do this, Edarra,” Perrin said. “They take these risks to dominate. We need to take the same risks in order to stop them.”</p>
<p class="tx">Edarra hissed softly, shaking her head. “Do not cut off your foot for fear that a snake will bite it, Perrin Aybara. Do not make a terrible mistake because you fear something that seems worse. This is all I will say on the topic.”</p>
<p class="tx">She stood and left him sitting by the fire.</p>
