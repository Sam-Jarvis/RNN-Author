<p class="ct"><span class="epub-i">Into the Thick of It</span></p>
<p class="tni">Elayne stepped out of the pavilion after the meeting—and entered a grove of a dozen or so trees. And not just any trees: they were towering, healthy, huge-limbed, beautiful trees, hundreds of feet tall with massive trunks. The way she froze and gaped would have been embarrassing if everyone else hadn’t been doing the same. She looked to the side, where Egwene stood, mouth open, as she stared up into the huge trees. The sun still shone above, but the green leaves shaded the area, explaining why the light had dimmed inside the tent.</p>
<p class="tx">“These trees,” Perrin said, stepping forward and resting his hand on the thick, ribbed bark. “I’ve seen Great Trees like this before. Inside a <span class="epub-i1">stedding</span>.”</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne embraced the Source. The glow of <span class="epub-i1">saidar</span> was there, a warmth alongside that of the sun. She breathed in the Power, and was amused to notice that most of the women who could channel had done as she had the moment a <span class="epub-i1">stedding</span> was mentioned.</p>
<p class="tx">“Well, whatever Rand is now,” Egwene said, folding her arms, “he can’t just make <span class="epub-i1">stedding</span> appear.” She seemed to find the thought comforting.</p>
<p class="tx">“Where did he go?” Elayne asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“He strolled out there,” Perrin said, waving toward the trees. “And vanished.”</p>
<p class="tx">People were walking among the massive trunks: soldiers from the various camps, staring upward. She heard a Shienaran talking to Lord Agelmar close by. “We watched them grow, my Lord. They burst from the ground; it took less than five minutes for them to become so tall. I swear it, my Lord, or may I never draw blade again.”</p>
<p class="tx">“All right,” Elayne said, releasing the Source. “Let’s begin. Nations are burning. Maps! We need maps!”</p>
<p class="tx">The other rulers turned toward her. In the meeting, with Rand standing there, few of them had objected to her being chosen to lead them. That was how it could be around him; a person was swept up in the tides of Rand’s will. Things seemed so logical when he spoke of them.</p>
<p class="tx">Many now looked displeased to have her put above them. Best to give them no time to dwell on it. “Where is Master Norry?” she said to Dyelin. “Could he have—”</p>
<p class="tx">“I have maps, Your Majesty,” Gareth Bryne said as he left the pavilion, Siuan at his side.</p>
<p class="tx">He seemed grayer than she remembered him; he wore a stiff white coat and trousers, the breast marked with the Flame of Tar Valon. He bowed in respect, but did not step too close. His uniform made his allegiance plain, as did Siuan’s protective hand on his arm.</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne remembered him standing with that same quiet expression behind her mother. Never presuming, always protecting the Queen. That queen had put him out to pasture. That event hadn’t been Elayne’s fault, but she could read the breached trust in Bryne’s face.</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne could not change what had come and gone. She could look only to the future. “If you have maps of this area and the potential battlefields presented to us, Lord Bryne, we would love to see them. I would like maps for the area between here and Caemlyn, a detailed map of Kandor and your best maps of the other Borderland areas.” To the rulers, she continued, “Gather your commanders and advisors! We must meet immediately with the other great captains to discuss our next course of action.”</p>
<p class="tx">It didn’t take long, though the confusion was pervasive as two dozen different factions set to work. Servants pulled open the sides of the pavilion, and Elayne ordered Sumeko to gather Kinswomen and guards to fetch tables and some chairs through a gateway from her camp. Elayne also sent for specific reports of what was happening at the Gap, where Rand had asked the bulk of the Borderlander armies to go and rescue Lan. The rulers and great captains had remained behind for the planning.</p>
<p class="tx">Shortly, Elayne and Egwene stood surveying Bryne’s detailed maps, which had been spread out across four tables. The rulers stood back and allowed the commanders to deliberate.</p>
<p class="tx">“This is good work, Bryne,” Lord Agelmar said. The Shienaran was one of the four remaining great captains. Bryne was another. The final two great captains—Davram Bashere and Rodel Ituralde—stood side by side at the end of another table, making corrections to a map of the western Borderlands. Ituralde had bags under his eyes, and his hands sometimes shook. From what Elayne had heard, he had suffered quite an ordeal in Maradon, having been rescued only very recently. She was surprised he was here, actually.</p>
<p class="tx">“All right,” Elayne said to the assembly. “We must fight. But how? Where?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Large forces of Shadowspawn have invaded three locations,” Bryne said. “Caemlyn, Kandor and Tarwin’s Gap. The Gap should not be abandoned, assuming our armies are enough to help Lord Mandragoran stabilize there. The likely result of our push there today will be the Shadowspawn pulling back into the pass. Keeping the enemy plugged up there is an unsuitable task for the Malkieri heavy cavalry alone. Perhaps we would best send him some pike companies? If he continues to plug that breach, we can devote the majority of our forces to combat in Andor and Kandor.”</p>
<p class="tx">Agelmar nodded. “Yes. That should be viable if we give Dai Shan the proper support. But we cannot risk letting Shienar become overrun as Kandor was. If they push out of the Gap…”</p>
<p class="tx">“We are prepared for an extended battle,” King Easar said. “Kandor’s resistance and Lan’s fight at the Gap have given us the time we need. Our people are pulling into our fortresses. We can hold, even if we lose the Gap.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Brave words, Your Majesty,” Gareth Bryne said, “but it would be best if we did not have to test the Shienarans in that way. Let us plan to hold the Gap with whatever force it takes to do so.”</p>
<p class="tx">“And Caemlyn?” Elayne asked.</p>
<p class="tx">Ituralde nodded. “An enemy force that deep behind our lines, with a Waygate to use for reinforcements … that is trouble.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Early reports from this morning,” Elayne said, “indicate they’re staying put for the time being. They burned large quarters of the city, but left other sections alone—and now that they have the city, the Trollocs have been set to work smothering the flames.”</p>
<p class="tx">“They will have to leave eventually,” Bryne said. “But it will be better if we can flush them out sooner, rather than later.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Why not consider a siege?” Agelmar asked. “I think the bulk of our armies should go to Kandor. I would not let the Throne of the Clouds and the Three Halls of Trade fall as did the Seven Towers.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Kandor already has fallen,” Prince Antol said softly.</p>
<p class="tx">The great captains looked at the eldest son of the Kandori queen. A tall man, he had a silent way about him. Now he spoke boldly. “My mother fights for our country,” he said, “but it is a fight of vengeance and redemption. Kandor burns, and it rips my heart to know it, but we cannot stop that. Give Andor your greatest attention; it is too tactically important to ignore, and I would not see another land fall as mine has.”</p>
<p class="tx">The others nodded. “Wise advice, Highness,” Bashere said. “Thank you.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Also, do not forget Shayol Ghul,” Rhuarc said from the periphery, where he stood alongside Perrin, some Aes Sedai and several other Aiel chiefs. The great captains turned toward Rhuarc, as if having forgotten he was there.</p>
<p class="tx">“The <span class="epub-i1">Car’a’carn</span> soon will assault Shayol Ghul,” Rhuarc said. “He will need spears at his back when he does so.”</p>
<p class="tx">“He will have them,” Elayne said. “Though that means four battlefronts. Shayol Ghul, Tarwin’s Gap, Kandor and Caemlyn.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Let us focus on Caemlyn first,” Ituralde said. “I don’t like the idea of a siege there. We <span class="epub-i1">need</span> to flush the Trollocs out. If we simply besiege them, it gives them more time to reinforce their numbers through that Waygate. We have to take them out now, on our terms.”</p>
<p class="tx">Agelmar nodded with a grunt, looking at the map of Caemlyn an aide had put on the table. “Can we stanch that flow? Retake the Waygate?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’ve tried,” Elayne said. “This morning, we sent three separate forces through a gateway into the basement with the Waygate, but the Shadow is prepared and entrenched. None of the forces returned. I don’t know if we <span class="epub-i1">can</span> take the Waygate back, or even destroy it.”</p>
<p class="tx">“What if we tried from the other side?” Agelmar asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“The other side?” Elayne asked. “You mean from <span class="epub-i1">inside</span> the Ways?”</p>
<p class="tx">Agelmar nodded.</p>
<p class="tx">“Nobody travels the Ways,” Ituralde said, aghast.</p>
<p class="tx">“The Trollocs do,” Agelmar said.</p>
<p class="tx">“I’ve been through them,” Perrin said, approaching the table. “And I’m sorry, my Lords, but I don’t think that taking the Waygate from the other side would work. From what I understand, we couldn’t destroy it—even with the One Power. And we couldn’t hold it inside, not with the Black Wind in there. Our best choice is to somehow get those Trollocs out of Caemlyn and then hold this side of the Waygate. If it is properly guarded, the Shadow would never be able to use it against us.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Very well,” Elayne said. “We will consider other options. Though, it occurs to me that we should send to the Black Tower for their Asha’man also. How many are there?”</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin cleared his throat. “I think you might want to be careful about that place, Your Majesty. Something’s going on there.”</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne frowned. “‘Something’?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t know,” Perrin said. “I spoke to Rand about it, and he was worried, and said he was going to investigate. Anyway … just be careful.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m always careful,” Elayne said absently. “So how do we get those Trollocs out of Caemlyn?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Perhaps we can hide a large assault force in Braem Wood; it’s here, almost fifty leagues north of Caemlyn.” Bryne pointed at the map. “If a smaller company of soldiers were to go up to the city gates and get the Trollocs to chase them back to the Wood as bait in the trap … I always worried that an invading army would use the Wood for cover as a base for attacking the city. I never thought I’d be considering the same option myself.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Interesting,” Agelmar said, studying a map of the terrain around Caemlyn. “That seems like a solid prospect.”</p>
<p class="tx">“But what of Kandor?” Bashere asked. “The Prince is right that the country is beyond rescue, but we cannot simply let the Trollocs pour out into other lands.”</p>
<p class="tx">Ituralde scratched at his chin. “This entire matter is going to be difficult. Three Trolloc armies, with us forced to divide our attention between them. Yes, more and more, I realize that the right move is to focus on one of them and set delaying forces against the other two.”</p>
<p class="tx">“The Shadow’s army at Caemlyn is likely the smallest,” Agelmar said, “as the size of the Waygate has restricted their entry into the city.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes,” Bashere agreed. “Our chance for a quick victory on one of the battlefronts is best at Caemlyn. We should strike hard there with the largest of our assault forces. If we can win in Andor, it will reduce the number of fronts we have to fight on—and that will be extremely advantageous.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes,” Elayne said. “We reinforce Lan, but tell him that his job will be to hold there as long as he can. We place a second force at the border of Kandor, with the purpose of delaying there as well—perhaps a slow withdrawal, as conditions dictate. While those two fronts are held, we can focus our true attention—and our largest army—at breaking the Trollocs in Caemlyn.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Good,” Agelmar said. “I like it. But what force do we place in Kandor? What army can slow the Trollocs, but won’t require a large commitment of troops?”</p>
<p class="tx">“The White Tower?” Elayne asked. “If we send the Aes Sedai to Kandor, they can slow the Trollocs’ advance across the border. That will let the rest of us concentrate on Caemlyn.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes,” Bryne said. “I like it.”</p>
<p class="tx">“And what of the fourth battlefront?” Ituralde asked. “Shayol Ghul? Does anyone know what the Lord Dragon plans there?”</p>
<p class="tx">Nobody spoke.</p>
<p class="tx">“The Aiel will see to his needs,” Amys said from beside the clan chiefs. “You needn’t worry about us. Make your battle plans, and we will make ours.”</p>
<p class="tx">“No,” Elayne said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Elayne?” Aviendha said. “We—”</p>
<p class="tx">“This is precisely what Rand wished to avoid,” Elayne said forcefully. “The Aiel will work with the rest of us. The battle at Shayol Ghul could be the most important of all. I won’t have one group presuming to keep to themselves and fight alone. You’ll accept our help.”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">And,</span> she added to herself, <span class="epub-i1">our direction.</span> The Aiel were excellent warriors, but there were some things they just wouldn’t admit. The usefulness of cavalry, for one.</p>
<p class="tx">The Aiel obviously did <span class="epub-i1">not</span> like the prospect of wetlander command. They bristled, eyes narrowing.</p>
<p class="tx">“The Aiel are excellent irregulars,” Bryne said, looking to them. “I faced you on the Blood Snow, and I know how deadly you can be. However, if the Lord Dragon attacks Shayol Ghul, we will likely need to seize the valley and then hold it for as long as it takes him to battle with the Dark One. I don’t know how long that will take, but it could take hours. Days. Tell me, have you ever had to entrench and fight a protracted, defensive war?”</p>
<p class="tx">“We will do what needs to be done,” Rhuarc said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Rhuarc,” Elayne said. “You yourselves insisted on signing the Dragon’s Peace. You yourselves insisted that you be part of our coalition. I expect you to live up to your word. You <span class="epub-i1">will</span> do as you are told.”</p>
<p class="tx">Bryne’s and Ituralde’s questions had set them off, but being told directly what to do made them back down. Rhuarc nodded. “Of course,” he said. “I have <span class="epub-i1">toh</span>.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Meet it by listening,” Elayne said, “and offering your opinion. If we’re going to fight on four different fronts at once, we’ll need a lot of coordination.” She looked at the gathered generals. “It occurs to me. We have four battlefronts, and four great captains…”</p>
<p class="tx">Bashere nodded. “No coincidence, that.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Well, it might be one.”</p>
<p class="tx">“There are no coincidences, Highness,” Bashere said. “If I’ve learned one thing traveling with the Lord Dragon, that is it. Four of us, four battlefronts. We each take one, with Queen Elayne coordinating among us and overseeing the war effort as a whole.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I will go to the Malkieri,” Agelmar said. “Most of the Borderlanders fight there now.”</p>
<p class="tx">“What of Kandor?” Elayne said.</p>
<p class="tx">“If the Aes Sedai are to fight there,” Bryne said, “so will I. My place is with the White Tower.”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">He doesn’t want to fight in Andor,</span> Elayne thought. <span class="epub-i1">He doesn’t want to fight alongside me. He wishes the break to be clean.</span> “Who comes to Andor with me, then?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’ll go,” Bashere said.</p>
<p class="tx">“And I to Shayol Ghul, then,” Ituralde said, nodding. “To fight alongside Aiel. A day I never thought I’d see, in truth.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Good,” Elayne said, pulling over a chair. “Then let’s dig into the thick of it and get to details. We need a central location for me to work from, and Caemlyn is lost. For now, I will use Merrilor. It is central, and has plenty of room to move troops and supplies around in. Perrin, do you think you could take charge of the logistics of this camp? Set up a Traveling ground, and organize the channelers to help with communications and supply operations?”</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin nodded.</p>
<p class="tx">“The rest of you,” she said, “let’s get to dividing the forces in detail and fleshing out the plans. We need a firm idea of how we are going to push those Trollocs out of Caemlyn so we can fight them on even ground.”</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Hours later, Elayne stepped from the pavilion, her mind spinning with details of tactics, supply needs and troop placements. When she blinked, she could see maps in her mind’s eye, covered with Gareth Bryne’s cramped notations.</p>
<p class="tx">The others from the meeting began trailing away to their separate camps to begin executing their battle plans. The dimming sky had required lanterns to be set up around the pavilion. She vaguely remembered both lunch and dinner being brought to the meeting. She’d eaten, hadn’t she? There had simply been so much to <span class="epub-i1">do</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">She nodded to those rulers who passed her, giving farewells. Most of the initial planning details had been worked out. On the morrow, Elayne would take her troops to Andor and begin the first leg of the counterattack against the Shadow.</p>
<p class="tx">The ground here was now soft and springy with deep green grass. Rand’s influence lingered, though he had departed. As Elayne inspected those towering trees, Gareth Bryne stepped up beside her.</p>
<p class="tx">She turned, surprised he hadn’t left the pavilion already. The only ones still here now were the servants and Elayne’s guards. “Lord Bryne?” she asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“I just wanted to say that I’m proud,” Bryne told her softly. “You did well in there.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I had hardly anything to add.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You added leadership,” Bryne said. “You aren’t a general, Elayne, and nobody expects you to be one. But when Tenobia complained about Saldaea being left exposed, you were the one who diverted her back to what matters. Tensions are high, but you kept us together, smoothed over bad feelings, prevented us from snapping at one another. Good work, Your Majesty. <span class="epub-i1">Very</span> good work.”</p>
<p class="tx">She grinned. Light, but it was hard not to positively beam at his words. He wasn’t her father, but in many ways, he was as close to one as she had. “Thank you. And Bryne, the crown apologizes for—”</p>
<p class="tx">“Not a word of that,” he said. “The Wheel weaves as it wills. I don’t blame Andor for what happened to me.” He hesitated. “I’m still going to fight together with the White Tower, Elayne.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I understand.”</p>
<p class="tx">He bowed to her and strode off toward Egwene’s section of camp.</p>
<p class="tx">Birgitte stepped up to Elayne. “Back to our camp, then?” the woman asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“I…” Elayne hesitated, hearing something. A faint sound, yet somehow deep and powerful. She frowned, walking toward it, holding up a hand to still Birgitte as she started to ask what was happening.</p>
<p class="tx">The two of them rounded the pavilion, crossing green grass and blossoming morning’s breath, walking toward the sound, which grew stronger and stronger. A song. A beautiful song, unlike any she had ever heard, that made her tremble with its striking sonority.</p>
<p class="tx">It washed over her, enveloped her, vibrated <span class="epub-i1">through</span> her. A joyful song, a song of awe and wonder, though she could not understand the words. She approached a group of towering creatures, like trees themselves, standing with their hands on the gnarled trunks of the trees Rand had grown, their eyes closed.</p>
<p class="tx">Three dozen Ogier of various ages, from those with eyebrows as white as new snow to those as young as Loial. He stood there with them, a smile raising the sides of his mouth as he sang.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin, arms folded, stood nearby with his wife. “Your talk of going to the Asha’man had me thinking—if we need allies, what about the Ogier? I was going to see if I could find Loial, but before I could set out, I found them already here among these trees.”</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne nodded, listening to the Ogier song reach its climax, then fade, the Ogier bowing their heads. For a moment, all was peaceful.</p>
<p class="tx">Finally, an ancient Ogier opened his eyes and turned toward Elayne. His white beard reached low on his chest, below the white mustaches that drooped on either side of his mouth. He stepped forward, other ancients both male and female joining him. With them came Loial.</p>
<p class="tx">“You are the Queen,” the ancient Ogier said, bowing to her. “The one who leads this journey. I am Haman, son of Dal son of Morel. We have come to lend our axes to your fight.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I am pleased,” Elayne said, nodding to him. “Three dozen Ogier will add strength to our battle.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Three dozen, young one?” Haman laughed a rumbling laugh. “The Great Stump did not meet, did not debate this long time, to send you three <span class="epub-i1">dozen</span> of our numbers. The Ogier will fight alongside humans. All of us. Every one of us who can hold an axe or long knife.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Wonderful!” Elayne said. “I will put you to good use.”</p>
<p class="tx">An older Ogier woman shook her head. “So hasty. So quick. Know this, young one. There were some who would have abandoned you, and the world, to the Shadow.”</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne blinked in shock. “You would have actually done it? Just … left us alone? To fight?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Some argued for it,” Haman said.</p>
<p class="tx">“I myself took that position,” the woman said. “I made the argument, though I did not truly believe it was right.”</p>
<p class="tx">“What?” Loial asked, stumbling forward. This seemed news to him. “You didn’t?”</p>
<p class="tx">The woman looked to him. “Trees will not grow if the Dark One claims this world.”</p>
<p class="tx">Loial looked surprised. “But why did you—”</p>
<p class="tx">“An argument must have opposition if it is to prove itself, my son,” she said. “One who argues truly learns the depth of his commitment through adversity. Did you not learn that trees grow roots most strongly when winds blow through them?” She shook her head, though she did seem fond. “That is not to say you should have left the <span class="epub-i1">stedding</span> when you did. Not alone. Fortunately, that has been taken care of.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Taken care of?” Perrin asked.</p>
<p class="tx">Loial blushed. “Well, you see, Perrin, I am married now.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You didn’t mention this earlier!”</p>
<p class="tx">“Everything has come so quickly. I am married to Erith, though, you see. She’s just over there. Did you hear her singing? Isn’t her song beautiful? Being married is not so bad, Perrin. Why didn’t you tell me it was not so bad? I think I am rather fond of it.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I am pleased for you, Loial,” Elayne cut in. Ogier could talk quite long on tangents if one was not careful. “And thankful, to all of you, for joining us.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It is worth the price, perhaps,” Haman said, “just to see these trees. In all my life, men have only <span class="epub-i1">cut</span> Great Trees. To see someone growing them instead … We made the correct decision. Yes, yes, we did. The others will need to see this…”</p>
<p class="tx">Loial waved to Perrin, apparently wanting to catch up. “Allow me to borrow him for a moment, Loial,” Elayne said, steering Perrin toward the center of the grove.</p>
<p class="tx">Faile and Birgitte joined her, and Loial waited behind. He seemed distracted by the mighty trees.</p>
<p class="tx">“I have a duty I want to assign you,” Elayne said softly to Perrin. “Losing Caemlyn threatens to send our armies into a supply crisis. Despite complaints of food prices, we had been keeping everyone fed, as well as accumulating stores for the battle ahead. Those stores are now gone.”</p>
<p class="tx">“What of Cairhien?” Perrin asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“It still has some food,” Elayne said. “As do the White Tower and Tear. Baerlon has good supplies of metals and powder—I need to find what we can draw from the other nations, and discover their food situation. It will be a massive task to coordinate stores and rations for all the armies. I’d like one person in charge of it all.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You were thinking of me?” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m sorry,” Perrin said. “Elayne, Rand needs me.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Rand needs us all.”</p>
<p class="tx">“He needs me more,” Perrin said. “Min saw it, he said. Without me at the Last Battle, he’ll die. Besides, I have a few fights to finish.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’ll do it,” Faile said.</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne turned toward her, frowning.</p>
<p class="tx">“It is my duty to manage the affairs of my husband’s army,” Faile said. “You are his liege lady, Your Majesty, so your needs are his needs. If Andor is to command the Last Battle, then the Two Rivers will see it fed. Give me access to gateways large enough for wagons to drive through, give me troops to protect my movements, and give me access to the quartermaster records of anyone I want. I will see it done.”</p>
<p class="tx">It was logical and rational, but not what Elayne needed. How far did she trust this woman? Faile had proven herself deft at politics. That was useful, but did she really consider herself part of Andor? Elayne studied the woman.</p>
<p class="tx">“There is nobody better you can trust with this task, Elayne,” Perrin said. “Faile <span class="epub-i1">will</span> see it done.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Perrin,” Elayne said. “There is a different matter involved in this. May we speak privately for a moment?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’ll just tell her what it is when we’re done, Your Majesty,” Perrin said. “I don’t keep secrets from my wife.”</p>
<p class="tx">Faile smiled.</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne eyed the two of them, then sighed softly. “Egwene came to me during our battle preparations. There is a certain … item of importance to the Last Battle that she needs to be delivered.”</p>
<p class="tx">“The Horn of Valere,” Perrin said. “You still have it, I hope.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We do. In the Tower, hidden. We moved it from the strongroom none too quickly. Last night, that room was broken into. I know only because of certain wards we set. The Shadow knows we have the Horn, Perrin, and the Dark One’s minions are looking for it. They can’t use it; it’s tied to Mat until he dies. But if the Shadow’s minions can capture it, he can keep Mat from using it. Or, worse—kill him, then blow it themselves.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You want to mask moving it,” Faile said, “using the supply runs to hide where you’re taking it.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We’d <span class="epub-i1">rather</span> just give it to Mat straight out,” Elayne said. “But he can be … difficult, sometimes. I had hoped he would be here at this meeting.”</p>
<p class="tx">“He’s in Ebou Dar,” Perrin said. “Doing something with the Seanchan.”</p>
<p class="tx">“He told you?” Elayne asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“Not exactly,” Perrin said, looking uncomfortable. “We … have some kind of connection. I sometimes see where he is and what he’s doing.”</p>
<p class="tx">“That man,” Elayne said, “is <span class="epub-i1">never</span> where he needs to be.”</p>
<p class="tx">“And yet,” Perrin said, “he always arrives there eventually.”</p>
<p class="tx">“The Seanchan are the enemy,” Elayne said. “Mat doesn’t seem to understand that, considering what he’s done. Light, I hope that man isn’t putting himself in trouble somehow…”</p>
<p class="tx">“I will do this,” Faile said. “I’ll care for the Horn of Valere. I’ll see it gets to Mat, guard it.”</p>
<p class="tx">“No offense to either of you,” Elayne said, “but I am hesitant to trust this to someone I don’t know well. That is why I came to you, Perrin.”</p>
<p class="tx">“That’s going to be a problem, Elayne,” Perrin said. “If they really are watching for the Horn, then they’ll <span class="epub-i1">expect</span> you and Egwene to give it to someone you know well. Choose Faile. There is nobody I trust more than her, but she won’t be suspected, as she has no direct relationship with the White Tower.”</p>
<p class="tx">Elayne nodded slowly. “Very well. I’ll send word to you on how it will be delivered. For now, begin running supplies to establish precedent. Too many people know about the Horn. After we give it to you, I will send five suspect envoys from the White Tower and seed the right rumors. We hope that the Shadow will assume the Horn is being carried by one of those envoys. I want it to be where nobody expects, at least until we can put it into Matrim’s hands.”</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">“Four battlefronts, Lord Mandragoran,” Bulen repeated. “That’s what the messengers are saying. Caemlyn, Shayol Ghul, Kandor, and here. They want to try to bottle up the Trollocs here and in Kandor while trying hard to defeat those in Andor first.”</p>
<p class="tx">Lan grunted, guiding Mandarb around the reeking heap of dead Trollocs. The carcasses served as a bulwark now that his five Asha’man had pushed them up into mounds like dark, bloody hills before the Blight, where the Shadowspawn gathered.</p>
<p class="tx">The stench was horrible, of course. Many of the guards he passed in his rounds had thrown sprigleaf onto their fires to cover up the smell.</p>
<p class="tx">Evening approached, bringing its most dangerous hours. Fortunately, those black clouds above made nights so dark that Trollocs had trouble seeing anything. Dusk, however, was a time of strength to them—a time when the eyes of humans were hampered but the eyes of Shadowspawn were not.</p>
<p class="tx">The power of the united Borderlander attack had pushed the Trollocs back toward the mouth of the Gap. Lan was getting reinforced by the hour with pikemen and other foot to help him hold position. All in all, it looked far better here now than it had just a day before.</p>
<p class="tx">Still grim, though. If what Bulen said was right, his army would be stationed here as a stalling force. That meant fewer troops for him than he would have liked. He could not fault the tactics presented, however.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan passed into the area where the Shienaran lancers cared for their horses. A figure emerged from them and rode up beside Lan. King Easar was a compact man with a white topknot, recently arrived from the Field of Merrilor following a long day making battle plans. Lan began a horseback bow, but stopped as King Easar bowed to <span class="epub-i1">him</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">“Your Majesty?” Lan asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“Agelmar has brought his plans for this battlefront, Dai Shan,” King Easar said, falling in beside him. “He would like to go over them with us. It is important that you are there; we fight beneath the banner of Malkier. We all agreed to it.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Tenobia?” Lan asked, genuinely surprised.</p>
<p class="tx">“In her case, a little encouragement was required. She came around. I also have word that Queen Ethenielle will leave Kandor and come here. The Borderlands fight together in this battle, and we do it with you at our head.”</p>
<p class="tx">They rode on in the fading light, row upon row of lancers saluting Easar. The Shienarans were the finest heavy cavalry in the world, and they had fought—and died—upon these rocks countless times, defending the lush lands to the south.</p>
<p class="tx">“I will come,” Lan agreed. “The weight of what you have given me feels like three mountains.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I know,” Easar said. “But we shall follow you, Dai Shan. Until the sky is rent asunder, until the rocks split underfoot, and until the Wheel itself stops turning. Or, Light send its blessing, until every sword is favored with peace.”</p>
<p class="tx">“What of Kandor? If the Queen comes here, who will lead that battle?”</p>
<p class="tx">“The White Tower rides to fight the Shadowspawn there,” Easar said. “You raised the Golden Crane. We were sworn to come to your aid, so we have.” He hesitated, and then his voice grew grim. “Kandor is beyond recovery now, Dai Shan. The Queen admits it. The White Tower’s job is not to recover it, but to stop the Shadowspawn from taking more territory.”</p>
<p class="tx">They turned and rode through the ranks of lancers. The men were required to spend dusk within a few paces of their mounts, and they made themselves busy, caring for armor, weapons and horses. Each man wore a longsword, sometimes two, strapped to his back, and all had maces and daggers at their belts. The Shienarans did not rely solely upon their lances; an enemy who thought to pin them without room to charge soon discovered that they could be very dangerous in close quarters.</p>
<p class="tx">Most of the men wore yellow surcoats over their plate-and-mail, bearing the black hawk. They gave their salutes with stiff backs and serious faces. Indeed, the Shienarans were a serious people. Living in the Borderlands did that.</p>
<p class="tx">Lan hesitated, then spoke in a loud voice. “Why do we mourn?”</p>
<p class="tx">The soldiers nearby turned toward him.</p>
<p class="tx">“Is this not what we have trained for?” Lan shouted. “Is this not our purpose, our very <span class="epub-i1">lives</span>? This war is not a thing to mourn. Other men may have been lax, but we have not been. We are prepared, and so this is a time of glory.</p>
<p class="tx">“Let there be laughter! Let there be joy! Let us cheer the fallen and drink to our forefathers, who taught us well. If you die on the morrow, awaiting your rebirth, be proud. The Last Battle is upon us, and <span class="epub-i1">we are ready</span>!”</p>
<p class="tx">Lan wasn’t sure, exactly, what had made him say it. His words inspired a round of “Dai Shan! Dai Shan! Forward the Golden Crane!” He saw that some of the men were writing the speech down, to pass among the other men.</p>
<p class="tx">“You do have the soul of a leader, Dai Shan,” Easar said as they rode on.</p>
<p class="tx">“It is not that,” Lan said, eyes forward. “I cannot stand self-pity. Too many of the men looked as if they were preparing their own shrouds.”</p>
<p class="tx">“A drum with no head,” Easar said softly, flicking his horse’s reins. “A pump with no grip. A song with no voice. Still it is mine. Still it is mine.”</p>
<p class="tx">Lan turned, frowning, but the King gave no explanation for the poem. If his people were a serious people, their king was more so. Easar had wounds deep within that he chose not to share. Lan did not fault him in this; Lan himself had done the same.</p>
<p class="tx">Tonight, however, he caught Easar smiling as he considered whatever it was that had brought the poem to his lips.</p>
<p class="tx">“Was that Anasai of Ryddingwood?” Lan asked.</p>
<p class="tx">Easar looked surprised. “You have read Anasai’s work?”</p>
<p class="tx">“She was a favorite of Moiraine Sedai. It sounded as though it might be hers.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Each of her poems was written as an elegy,” Easar said. “This was for her father. She left instructions; it can be read, but should not be spoken out loud, except when it was right to do so. She did not explain when it would be right to do so.”</p>
<p class="tx">They reached the war tents and dismounted. No sooner had they done so, however, than the horns of alarm began to sound. Both men reacted, and Lan unconsciously touched the sword on his hip.</p>
<p class="tx">“Let us go to Lord Agelmar,” Lan shouted as men began to yell and equipment to rattle. “If you fight beneath my banner, then I will accept the role of leader gladly.”</p>
<p class="tx">“No hesitation at all?” Easar said.</p>
<p class="tx">“What am I?” Lan asked, swinging into the saddle. “Some sheepherder from a forgotten village? I will do my duty. If men are foolish enough to put me in charge of them, I’ll send them about theirs as well.”</p>
<p class="tx">Easar nodded, then saluted, the corners of his mouth rising in another smile. Lan returned the salute, then galloped Mandarb through the center of the camp. The men at the outskirts were lighting bonfires; Asha’man had created gateways to one of the many dying forests in the south for soldiers to gather wood. If Lan had his way, those five channelers would never waste their strength killing Trollocs. They were far too useful otherwise.</p>
<p class="tx">Narishma saluted Lan as he passed. Lan could not be certain that the great captains had chosen Borderlander Asha’man for him on purpose, but it seemed not to be a coincidence. He had at least one from each Borderlander nation—even one born to Malkieri parents.</p>
