<p class="para1"><strong class="calibre14">A Note on Dates in This Glossary.</strong> The Toman Calendar (devised by Toma dur Ahmid) was adopted approximately two centuries after the death of the last male Aes Sedai, recording years After the Breaking of the World (AB). So many records were destroyed in the Trolloc Wars that at their end there was argument about the exact year under the old system. A new calendar, proposed by Tiam of Gazar, celebrated freedom from the Trolloc threat and recorded each year as a Free Year (FY). The Gazaran Calendar gained wide acceptance within twenty years after the Wars’ end. Artur Hawkwing attempted to establish a new calendar based on the founding of his empire (FF, From the Founding), but only historians now refer to it. After the death and destruction of the War of the Hundred Years, a third calendar was devised by Uren din Jubai Soaring Gull, a scholar of the Sea Folk, and promulgated by the Panarch Farede of Tarabon. The Farede <a id="page_1073" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>Calendar, dating from the arbitrarily decided end of the War of the Hundred Years and recording years of the New Era (NE), is currently in use.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Aelfinn:</strong> A race of beings, largely human in appearance but with snakelike characteristics, who will give true answers to three questions. Whatever the question, their answers are always correct, if frequently given in forms that are not clear, but questions concerning the Shadow can be extremely dangerous. Their true location is unknown, but they can be visited by passing through a <em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em>, once a possession of Mayene but in recent years held in the Stone of Tear. There are reports that they can also be reached by entering the Tower of Ghenjei. They speak the Old Tongue, mention treaties and agreements and ask if those entering carry iron, instruments of music or devices that can make fire. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Eelfinn.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Arad Doman:</strong> A nation on the Aryth Ocean, currently racked by civil war and by wars against those who have declared for the Dragon Reborn. Its capital is Bandar Eban, where many of its people have come for refuge. Food is scarce. In Arad Doman, those who are descended from the nobility at the time of the founding of the nation, as opposed to those raised later, are known as the bloodborn. The ruler (king or queen) is elected by a council of the heads of merchant guilds (the Council of Merchants), who are almost always women. He or she must be from the noble class, not the merchant, and is elected for life. Legally the king or queen has absolute authority, except that he or she can be deposed by a three-quarter vote of the Council. The current ruler is <a id="page_1074" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>King Alsalam Saeed Almadar, Lord of Almadar, High Seat of House Almadar. His present whereabouts are much shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Area, units of:</strong> (1) Land: 1 ribbon = 20 paces × 10 paces (200 square paces); 1 cord = 20 paces × 50 paces (1000 square paces); 1 hide = 100 paces × 100 paces (10,000 square paces); 1 rope = 100 paces × 1000 paces (100,000 square paces); 1 march = 1000 paces × 1000 paces (1/4 square mile). (2) Cloth: 1 pace = 1 pace plus 1 hand × 1 pace plus 1 hand.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Asha’man:</strong> (1) In the Old Tongue, “Guardian” or “Guardians,” but always a guardian of justice and truth. (2) The name given, both collectively and as a rank, to the men who have come to the Black Tower, near Caemlyn in Andor, in order to learn to channel. Their training largely concentrates on the ways in which the One Power can be used as a weapon, and in another departure from the usages of the White Tower, once they learn to seize <em class="calibre4">saidin</em>, the male half of the Power, they are required to perform all chores and labors with the Power. When newly enrolled, a man is termed a Soldier; he wears a plain black coat with a high collar, in the Andoran fashion. Being raised to Dedicated brings the right to wear a silver pin, called the Sword, on the collar of his coat. Promotion to Asha’man brings the right to wear a Dragon pin, in gold and red enamel, on the collar opposite the Sword. Although many women, including wives, flee when they learn that their men actually can channel, a fair number of men at the Black Tower are married, and they use a version of the Warder bond to create a link with their wives. This same bond, altered to compel <a id="page_1075" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>obedience, has recently been used to bond captured Aes Sedai as well. Some Asha’man have been bonded by Aes Sedai, although the traditional Warder bond is used. The Asha’man are led by Mazrim Taim, who has styled himself the M’Hael, Old Tongue for “leader.”</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Band of the Red Hand:</strong> <em class="calibre4">see Shen an Calhar.</em></p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Blood, the:</strong> Term used by the Seanchan to designate the nobility. There are four degrees of nobility, two of the High Blood and two of the low, or lesser, Blood. The High Blood let their fingernails grow to a length of one inch and shave the sides of their heads, leaving a crest down the center, narrower for men than for women. The length of this crest varies according to fashion. The low Blood also grow their fingernails long, but they shave the sides and back of the head, leaving what appears to be a bowl of hair, with a wide tail at the back allowed to grow longer, often to the shoulder for men or to the waist for women. Those of the highest level of the High Blood are called High Lady or High Lord and lacquer the first two fingernails on each hand. Those of the next level of the High Blood are called simply Lord or Lady and lacquer only the nails of the forefingers. Those of the low Blood also are called simply Lady or Lord, but those of the higher rank lacquer the nails of the last two fingers on each hand, while those on the lowest level lacquer only the nails of the little fingers. The Empress and immediate members of the Imperial family shave their heads entirely and lacquer all of their fingernails One can be raised to the Blood as well as born to it, and this is frequently a reward for outstanding accomplishment or service to the Empire.</p>
<p class="para4"><a id="page_1076" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14">Brown Ajah Council:</strong> The Brown Ajah is headed by a council instead of an individual Aes Sedai. The current head of the council is Jesse Bilal in the White Tower; the other members in the White Tower and all of those in the rebel camp are unknown.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">calendar:</strong> There are 10 days to the week, 28 days to the month and 13 months to the year. Several feast days are not part of any month; these include Sunday (the longest day of the year), the Feast of Thanksgiving (once every four years at the spring equinox) and the Feast of All Souls Salvation, also called All Souls Day (once every ten years at the autumn equinox). While the months have names (Taisham, Jumara, Saban, Aine, Adar, Saven, Amadaine, Tammaz, Maigdhal, Choren, Shaldine, Nesan and Danu), these are seldom used except in official documents and by officials. For most people, using the seasons is good enough.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Captain-General:</strong> The title given to the head of the Green Ajah. This position is currently held by Adelorna Bastine in the White Tower, and Myrelle Berengari among the rebel faction.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Children of the Light:</strong> Society of strict ascetic beliefs, owing allegiance to no nation and dedicated to the defeat of the Dark One and the destruction of all Darkfriends. Founded during the War of the Hundred Years by Lothair Mantelar to proselytize against an increase in Darkfriends, they evolved during the war into a completely military society. They are extremely rigid in their beliefs, and certain that only they know the truth and the right. They consider Aes Sedai and any <a id="page_1077" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>who support them to be Darkfriends. Known disparagingly as Whitecloaks, a name they themselves despise, they were formerly headquartered in Amador, Amadicia, but were forced out when the Seanchan conquered the city. Galad Damodred became Lord Captain Commander after he killed Eamon Valda in a duel for assaulting his stepmother, Morgase. Valda’s death produced a schism in the organization, with Galad leading one faction, and Rhadam Asunawa, High Inquisitor of the Hand of the Light, leading the other. Their sign is a golden sunburst on a field of white. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Questioners.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">Commentary on the Dragon</em>:</strong> A book by Sajius of which little is known.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">Comprehensive Discussion of Pre-Breaking Relics, A</em>:</strong> A book of which little is known (other than its title).</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">Corenne</em>:</strong> In the Old Tongue, “the Return.” The name given by the Seanchan both to the fleet of thousands of ships and to the hundreds of thousands of soldiers, craftsmen and others carried by those ships, who came behind the Forerunners to reclaim the lands stolen from Artur Hawkwing’s descendants. The <em class="calibre4">Corenne</em> is led by Captain-General Lunal Galgan. <em class="calibre4">See also Hailene</em>, <em class="calibre4">Rhyagelle</em>.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">cuendillar</em>:</strong> A supposedly indestructible substance created during the Age of Legends. Any known force used in an attempt to break it, including the One Power, is absorbed, making <em class="calibre4">cuendillar</em> stronger. Although the making of <em class="calibre4">cuendillar</em> was thought lost forever, new <a id="page_1078" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>objects made from it have surfaced. It is also known as heartstone.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">currency:</strong> After many centuries of trade, the standard terms for coins are the same in every land: crowns (the largest coin in size), marks and pennies. Crowns and marks can be minted of gold or silver, while pennies can be silver or copper, the last often called simply a copper. In different lands, however, these coins are of different sizes and weights. Even in one nation, coins of different sizes and weights have been minted by different rulers. Because of trade, the coins of many nations can be found almost anywhere, and for that reason, bankers, moneylenders and merchants all use scales to determine the value of any given coin. Even large numbers of coins are weighed.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The heaviest coins come from Andor and Tar Valon, and in those two places the relative values are: 10 copper pennies = 1 silver penny; 100 silver pennies = 1 silver mark; 10 silver marks = 1 silver crown; 10 silver crowns = 1 gold mark; 10 gold marks = 1 gold crown. By contrast, in Altara, where the larger coins contain less gold or silver, the relative values are: 10 copper pennies = 1 silver penny; 21 silver pennies = 1 silver mark; 20 silver marks = 1 silver crown; 20 silver crowns = 1 gold mark; 20 gold marks = 1 gold crown.</p>
<p class="indent-para">The only paper currency is “letters-of-rights,” which are issued by bankers, guaranteeing to present a certain amount of gold or silver when the letter-of-rights is presented. Because of the long distances between cities, the length of time needed to travel from one to another and the difficulties of transactions at long <a id="page_1079" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>distance, a letter-of-rights may be accepted at full value in a city near to the bank which issued it, but it may only be accepted at a lower value in a city farther away. Generally, someone intending to be traveling for a long time will carry one or more letters-of-rights to exchange for coin when needed. Letters-of-rights are usually accepted only by bankers or merchants, and would never be used in shops.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">da’covale</em>:</strong> (1) In the Old Tongue, “one who is owned,” or “person who is property.” (2) Among the Seanchan, the term often used, along with “property,” for slaves. Slavery has a long and unusual history among the Seanchan, with slaves having the ability to rise to positions of great power and open authority, including authority over those who are free. It is also possible for those in positions of great power to be reduced to <em class="calibre4">da’covale</em>. <em class="calibre4">See also so’jhin</em>.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Deathwatch Guards, the:</strong> The elite military formation of the Seanchan Empire, including both humans and Ogier. The human members of the Deathwatch Guard are all <em class="calibre4">da’covale</em>, born as property and chosen while young to serve the Empress, whose personal property they are. Fanatically loyal and fiercely proud, they often display the ravens tattooed on their shoulders, the mark of a <em class="calibre4">da’covale</em> of the Empress. The Ogier members are known as Gardeners, and they are not <em class="calibre4">da’covale</em>. The Gardeners are as fiercely loyal as the human Deathwatch Guards, though, and are even more feared. Human or Ogier, the Deathwatch Guards not only are ready to die for the Empress and the Imperial family, <a id="page_1080" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>but believe that their lives are the property of the Empress, to be disposed of as she wishes. Their helmets and armor are lacquered in dark green (so dark that it is often mistakenly called black) and blood-red, their shields are lacquered black and their swords, spears, axes and halberds carry black tassels. <em class="calibre4">See also da’covale</em>.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Delving:</strong> (1) Using the One Power to diagnose physical condition and illness. (2) Finding deposits of metal ores with the One Power. That this has long been a lost ability among Aes Sedai may account for the name becoming attached to another ability.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Depository:</strong> A division of the Tower Library. There are twelve publicly known Depositories, each having books and records pertaining to a particular subject, or to related subjects. A Thirteenth Depository, known only to some Aes Sedai, contains secret documents, records and histories which may be accessed only by the Amyrlin Seat, the Keeper of the Chronicles, and the Sitters in the Hall of the Tower. And, of course, by that handful of librarians who maintain the depository.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">der’morat-:</em></strong> (1) In the Old Tongue, “master handler.” (2) Among the Seanchan, the prefix applied to indicate a senior and highly skilled handler of one of the exotics, one who trains others, as in <em class="calibre4">der’morat’raken</em>. <em class="calibre4">Der’morat</em> can have a fairly high social status, the highest of all held by <em class="calibre4">der’sul’dam</em>, the trainers of <em class="calibre4">sul’dam,</em> who rank with fairly high military officers. <em class="calibre4">See also morat</em>-.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">Echoes of His Dynasty:</em></strong> A book of which little is known.</p>
<p class="para4"><a id="page_1081" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14">Eelfinn:</strong> A race of beings, largely human in appearance but with foxlike characteristics, who will grant three wishes, although they ask for a price in return. If the person asking does not negotiate a price, the Eelfinn choose it. The most common price in such circumstances is death, but they still fulfill their part of the bargain, although the manner in which they fulfill it is seldom the manner the one asking expects. Their true location is unknown, but it was possible to visit them by means of a <em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em> that was located in Rhuidean. That <em class="calibre4">ter’angreal</em> was taken by Moiraine Damodred to Cairhien, where it was destroyed. It is also reported that they may be reached by entering the Tower of Ghenjei. They ask the same questions as the Aelfinn regarding fire, iron and musical instruments. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Aelfinn.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">Falling Shale</em>:</strong> A history of which little is known.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Fel, Herid:</strong> The author of <em class="calibre4">Reason and Unreason</em> and other books. Fel was a student (and teacher) of history and philosophy at the Academy of Cairhien. He was discovered in his study torn limb from limb.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">First Reasoner:</strong> The title given to the head of the White Ajah. This position is currently held by Ferane Neheran, an Aes Sedai in the White Tower. Ferane Sedai is one of only two Ajah heads to sit in the Hall of the Tower at present.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">First Selector:</strong> The title given to the head of the Blue Ajah. The First Selector is currently unknown, although it is suspected that Lelaine Akashi fills this position.</p>
<p class="para4"><a id="page_1082" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14">First Weaver:</strong> The title given to the head of the Yellow Ajah. This position is currently held by Suana Dragand in the White Tower. Suana Sedai is one of only two Ajah heads to sit in the Hall of the Tower at present. Among the rebel Aes Sedai, Romanda Cassin holds this position.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Forcing; forced:</strong> When someone with the ability to channel handles as much of the One Power as they can over long periods of time and channels continually, they learn faster and gain strength more rapidly. This is called forcing, or being forced, by Aes Sedai, who abjure the practice with novices and Accepted because of the danger of death or being burned out.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Forerunners, the:</strong> <em class="calibre4">See Hailene</em>.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Forsaken, the:</strong> The name given to thirteen powerful Aes Sedai, men and women both, who went over to the Shadow during the Age of Legends and were trapped in the sealing of the Bore into the Dark One’s prison. While it has long been believed that they alone abandoned the Light during the War of the Shadow, in fact others did as well; these thirteen were only the highest-ranking among them. The Forsaken (who call themselves the Chosen) are somewhat reduced in number since their awakening in the present day. Some of those killed have been reincarnated in new bodies.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">Hailene</em>:</strong> In the Old Tongue, “Forerunners,” or “Those Who Come Before.” The term applied by the Seanchan to the massive expeditionary force sent across the Aryth <a id="page_1083" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>Ocean to scout out the lands where Artur Hawkwing once ruled. Originally under the command of the High Lady Suroth, it has now been subsumed into the <em class="calibre4">Corenne</em>. <em class="calibre4">See Corenne</em>, <em class="calibre4">Rhyagelle</em>.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Hand:</strong> In Seanchan, Hand refers to a primary assistant or one of a hierarchy of Imperial functionaries. A Hand of the Empress is of the First Rank, and Lesser Hands will be found at lower ranks. Some Hands operate in secret, such as those who guide the Seekers and Listeners; others are known and display their rank by wearing the appropriate number of golden hands embroidered on their clothing.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Hanlon, Daved:</strong> A Darkfriend, also known as Doilin Mellar, who was captured with Lady Shiaine, Chesmal Emry, Eldrith Jhondar, Temaile Kinderode, Falion Bhoda and Marillin Gemalphin. They are currently being held prisoner in the Royal Palace of Andor.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Head Clerk:</strong> The title given to the head of the Gray Ajah. This position is currently held by Serancha Colvine in the White Tower.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Head of the Great Council of Thirteen:</strong> The title given to the head of the Black Ajah. This position is currently held by Alviarin Freidhen.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">heart:</strong> The basic unit of organization in the Black Ajah. In effect, a cell. A heart consists of three sisters who know each other, with each member of the heart knowing one additional sister of the Black who is unknown to the other two of her heart.</p>
<p class="para4"><a id="page_1084" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14">Highest:</strong> The title given to the head of the Red Ajah. This position is currently held by Tsutama Rath.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Illuminators, Guild of:</strong> A society that held the secret of making fireworks. It guarded this secret very closely, even to the extent of doing murder to protect it. The Guild gained its name from the grand displays, called Illuminations, that it provided for rulers and sometimes for greater lords. Lesser fireworks were sold for use by others, but with dire warnings of the disaster that could result from attempting to learn what was inside them. The Guild once had chapter houses in Cairhien and Tanchico, but both are now destroyed. In addition, the members of the Guild in Tanchico resisted the invasion by the Seanchan and were made <em class="calibre4">da’covale</em>, and the Guild as such no longer exists. However, individual Illuminators still exist outside of Seanchan rule and work to make sure that the Guild will be remembered. <em class="calibre4">See also da’covale</em>.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Ishara:</strong> The first Queen of Andor (circa FY 994–1020). At the death of Artur Hawkwing, Ishara convinced her husband, one of Hawkwing’s foremost generals, to raise the siege of Tar Valon and accompany her to Caemlyn with as many soldiers as he could break away from the army. Where others tried to seize the whole of Hawkwing’s empire and failed, Ishara took a firm hold on a small part and succeeded. Today, nearly every noble House in Andor contains some of Ishara’s blood, and the right to claim the Lion Throne depends both on direct descent from her and on the number of lines of connection to her that can be established.</p>
<p class="para4"><a id="page_1085" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14">Kaensada:</strong> An area of Seanchan that is populated by less-than-civilized hill tribes. These tribes fight a great deal among themselves, as do individual families within the tribes. Each tribe has its own customs and taboos, the latter of which often make no sense to anyone outside that tribe. Most of the tribesmen avoid the more civilized residents of Seanchan.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Lance-Captain:</strong> In most lands, noblewomen do not personally lead their armsmen into battle under normal circumstances. Instead, they hire a professional soldier, almost always a commoner, who is responsible both for training and leading their armsmen. Depending on the land, this man can be called a Lance-Captain, Sword-Captain, Master of the Horse or Master of the Lances. Rumors of closer relationships than Lady and servant often spring up, perhaps inevitably. Sometimes they are true.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Legion of the Dragon, the:</strong> A large military formation, all infantry, giving allegiance to the Dragon Reborn, trained by Davram Bashere along lines worked out by himself and Mat Cauthon, lines which depart sharply from the usual employment of foot. While many men simply walk in to volunteer, large numbers of the Legion are scooped up by recruiting parties from the Black Tower, who first gather all of the men in an area who are willing to follow the Dragon Reborn, and only after taking them through gateways near Caemlyn winnow out those who can be taught to channel. The remainder, by far the greater number, are sent to Bashere’s training camps.</p>
<p class="para4"><a id="page_1086" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14">Length, units of:</strong> 10 inches = 1 foot; 3 feet = 1 pace; 2 paces = 1 span; 1000 spans = 1 mile; 4 miles = 1 league.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Listeners:</strong> A Seanchan spy organization. Almost anyone in the household of a Seanchan noble, merchant or banker may be a Listener, including <em class="calibre4">da’covale</em> occasionally, though seldom <em class="calibre4">so’jhin</em>. They take no active role, merely watching, listening and reporting. Their reports are sent to Lesser Hands who control both them and the Seekers and decide what should be passed on to the Seekers for further action. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Seekers, Hand.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">marath’damane</em>:</strong> In the Old Tongue, “those who must be leashed,” and also “one who must be leashed.” The term applied by the Seanchan to any woman capable of channeling who has not been collared as a <em class="calibre4">damane</em>.</p>

<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">Mera’din:</em></strong> In the Old Tongue, “the Brotherless.” The name adopted, as a society, by those Aiel who abandoned clan and sept and went to the Shaido because they could not <a id="page_1087" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>accept Rand al’Thor, a wetlander, as the <em class="calibre4">Car’a’carn</em>, or because they refused to accept his revelations concerning the history and origins of the Aiel. Deserting clan and sept for any reason is anathema among the Aiel; therefore their own warrior societies among the Shaido were unwilling to take them in, and they formed this society, the Brotherless.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Moiraine Damodred:</strong> A Cairhienin Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah. Long presumed dead. Thom Merrilin has, however, revealed the receipt of a letter purporting to be from her. It is reproduced here:</p>
<p class="para1"> </p>
<p class="paraa4">My dearest Thom,</p>
<p class="paraa4">There are many words I would like to write to you, words from my heart, but I have put this off because I knew that I must, and now there is little time. There are many things I cannot tell you lest I bring disaster, but what I can, I will. Heed carefully what I say. In a short while I will go down to the docks, and there I will confront Lanfear. How can I know that? That secret belongs to others. Suffice it that I know, and let that foreknowledge stand as proof for the rest of what I say.</p>
<p class="indent-paraa">When you receive this, you will be told that I am dead. All will believe that. I am not dead, and it may be that I shall live to my appointed years. It also may be that you and Mat Cauthon and another, a man I do not know, will try to rescue me. May, I say because it may be that you will not or cannot, or because Mat may refuse. He does not hold me in the affection you seem to, and he has his reasons which he no doubt thinks are good. If you try, it must be only you and Mat and one other. More will mean death for all. Fewer will mean death for all.</p>
<p class="indent-paraa"><a id="page_1088" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>Even if you come only with Mat and one other, death also may come. I have seen you try and die, one or two or all three. I have seen myself die in the attempt. I have seen all of us live and die as captives.</p>
<p class="indent-paraa">Should you decide to make the attempt anyway, young Mat knows the way to find me, yet you must not show him this letter until he asks about it. That is of the utmost importance. He must know nothing that is in this letter until he asks. Events must play out in certain ways, whatever the costs.</p>
<p class="indent-paraa">If you see Lan again, tell him that all of this is for the best. His destiny follows a different path from mine. I wish him all happiness with Nynaeve.</p>
<p class="indent-paraa">A final point. Remember what you know about the game of Snakes and Foxes. Remember, and heed.</p>
<p class="indent-paraa">It is time, and I must do what must be done.</p>
<p class="indent-paraa">May the Light illumine you and give you joy, my dearest Thom, whether or not we ever see one another again.</p>

<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Prophet, the:</strong> More formally, the Prophet of the Lord Dragon. Once known as Masema Dagar, a Shienaran <a id="page_1089" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>soldier, he underwent a revelation and decided that he had been called to spread the word of the Dragon’s Rebirth. He believed that nothing—nothing!—was more important than acknowledging the Dragon Reborn as the Light made flesh and being ready when the Dragon Reborn called, and he and his followers would use any means to force others to sing the glories of the Dragon Reborn. Those who refused were marked for death, and those who were slow might find their homes and shops burned and themselves flogged. Forsaking any name but “the Prophet,” he brought chaos to much of Ghealdan and Amadicia, large parts of which he controlled, although with him gone, the Seanchan are reestablishing order in Amadicia and the Crown High Council in Ghealdan. He joined with Perrin Aybara, who was sent to bring him to Rand, and, for reasons unknown, stayed with him even though this delayed his going to the Dragon Reborn. He was followed by men and women of the lowest sort; if they were not so when they were pulled in by his charisma, they became so under his influence. He died under mysterious circumstances.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Queen’s Guard, the:</strong> The elite military formation in Andor. In peacetime the Guard is responsible for upholding the Queen’s law and keeping the peace across Andor. The uniform of the Queen’s Guard includes a red undercoat, gleaming mail and plate armor, a brilliant red cloak and a conical helmet with a barred visor. High-ranking officers wear knots of rank on their shoulder and golden lion-head spurs. A recent addition to the Queen’s Guard is the Daughter-Heir’s personal bodyguard, which is composed entirely of women since the arrest of its former captain, Doilin Mellar. These <a id="page_1090" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>Guardswomen wear much more elaborate uniforms than their male counterparts, including broad-brimmed hats with white plumes, red-lacquered breastplates and helmets trimmed in white and lace-edged sashes bearing the White Lion of Andor.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Questioners, the:</strong> An order within the Children of the Light. They refer to themselves as the Hand of the Light—they intensely dislike being called Questioners—and their avowed purposes are to discover the truth in disputations and uncover Darkfriends. In the search for truth and the Light, their normal method of inquiry is torture; their normal manner is that they know the truth already and must only make their victim confess to it. At times they act as if they are entirely separate from the Children and the Council of the Anointed, which commands the Children. The head of the Questioners is the High Inquisitor, at present Rhadam Asunawa, who sits on the Council of the Anointed. After Galad Damodred killed Lord Captain Commander Valda and assumed Valda’s position, there was a schism in the organization, with Galad leading one faction, and Asunawa leading the other. Their sign is a blood-red shepherd’s crook.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Redarms:</strong> Soldiers of the Band of the Red Hand, who have been chosen for temporary police duty to make sure that other soldiers of the Band cause no trouble or damage in a town or village where the Band has stopped. So named because, while on duty, they wear very broad red armbands that reach from cuff to elbow. Usually chosen from among the most experienced and reliable men. Since any damages must be paid for by <a id="page_1091" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>the men serving as Redarms, they work hard to make sure all is quiet and peaceful. A number of former Redarms were chosen to accompany Mat Cauthon to Ebou Dar. <em class="calibre4">See also Shen an Calhar</em>.</p>

<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Seandar:</strong> The Imperial capital of Seanchan, located in the northeast of the Seanchan continent. It is also the largest city in the Empire. After the death of Empress Radhanan, it descended into chaos.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Seekers:</strong> More formally, Seekers for Truth, they are a police/spy organization of the Seanchan Imperial Throne. Although most Seekers are <em class="calibre4">da’covale</em> and the property of the Imperial family, they have wide-ranging powers. Even one of the Blood can be arrested for failure to answer any question put by a Seeker, or for failure to cooperate fully with a Seeker, this last defined by the Seekers themselves, subject only to review by the Empress. Their reports are sent to Lesser Hands, who control both them and the Listeners. Most Seekers feel that the Hands do not pass on as much information as they should. Unlike the Listeners’, the Seekers’ role is active. Those Seekers who are <em class="calibre4">da’covale</em> are marked on either shoulder with a raven and a tower. Unlike the <a id="page_1092" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>Deathwatch Guards, Seekers are seldom eager to show their ravens, in part because it necessitates revealing who and what they are. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Hand, Listeners.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">sei’mosiev</em>:</strong> In the Old Tongue, “lowered eyes,” or “downcast eyes.” Among the Seanchan, to say that one has “become <em class="calibre4">sei’mosiev</em>” means that one has “lost face.” <em class="calibre4">See also sei’taer.</em></p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">sei’taer</em>:</strong> In the Old Tongue, “straight eyes,” or “level eyes.” Among the Seanchan, it refers to honor or face, to the ability to meet someone’s eyes. It is possible to “be” or “have” <em class="calibre4">sei’taer</em>, meaning that one has honor and face, and also to “gain” or “lose” <em class="calibre4">sei’taer</em>. <em class="calibre4">See also sei’mosiev</em>.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Shara:</strong> A mysterious land to the east of the Aiel Waste which is the source of silk and ivory, among other trade goods. The land is protected both by inhospitable natural features and by man-made walls. Little is known about Shara, as the people of that land work to keep their culture secret. The Sharans deny that the Trolloc Wars touched them, despite Aiel statements to the contrary. They deny knowledge of Artur Hawkwing’s attempted invasion, despite the accounts of eyewitnesses from the Sea Folk. The little information that has leaked out reveals that the Sharans are ruled by a single absolute monarch, a Sh’boan if a woman and a Sh’botay if a man. That monarch rules for exactly seven years, then dies. The rule then passes to the mate of that ruler, who rules for seven years and then dies. This pattern has repeated itself since the time of the Breaking of the World. The Sharans believe that the deaths are the “Will of the Pattern.”</p>
<p class="indent-para">There are channelers in Shara, known as the Ayyad, <a id="page_1093" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>who are tattooed on their faces at birth. The women of the Ayyad enforce the Ayyad laws stringently. A sexual relationship between Ayyad and non-Ayyad is punishable by death for the non-Ayyad, and the Ayyad is also executed if force on his or her part can be proven. If a child is born of the union, it is left exposed to the elements, and dies. Male Ayyad are used as breeding stock only. They are not educated in any fashion, not even how to read or write, and when they reach their twenty-first year or begin to channel, whichever comes first, they are killed and the body cremated. Supposedly, the Ayyad channel the One Power only at the command of the Sh’boan or Sh’botay, who is always surrounded by Ayyad women.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Even the name of the land is in doubt. The natives have been known to call it many different names, including Shamara, Co’dansin, Tomaka, Kigali and Shibouya.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">Shen an Calhar</em>:</strong> In the Old Tongue, “the Band of the Red Hand.” (1) A legendary group of heroes who had many exploits, finally dying in the defense of Manetheren when that land was destroyed during the Trolloc Wars. (2) A military formation put together almost by accident by Mat Cauthon and organized along the lines of military forces during what is considered the height of the military arts, the days of Artur Hawkwing and the centuries immediately preceding.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Sisnera, Darlin:</strong> A High Lord in Tear, he was formerly in rebellion against the Dragon Reborn. After serving for a short period as Steward of the Dragon Reborn in Tear, he was chosen to be the first king of Tear.</p>
<p class="para4"><a id="page_1094" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14">Snakes and Foxes:</strong> A game that is much loved by children until they mature enough to realize that it can never be won without breaking the rules. It is played with a board that has a web of lines with arrows indicating direction. There are ten discs inked with triangles to represent the foxes, and ten discs inked with wavy lines to represent the snakes. The game is begun by saying, “Courage to strengthen, fire to blind, music to dazzle, iron to bind,” while describing a triangle with a wavy line through it with one’s hand. Dice are rolled to determine moves for the players and the snakes and foxes. If a snake or fox lands on a player’s piece, he is out of the game, and as long as the rules are followed, this always happens.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="calibre4">so’jhin</em>:</strong> The closest translation from the Old Tongue would be “a height among lowness,” though some translate it as meaning “both sky and valley” among several other possibilities. <em class="calibre4">So’jhin</em> is the term applied by the Seanchan to hereditary upper servants. They are <em class="calibre4">da’covale</em>, property, yet occupy positions of considerable authority and often power. Even the Blood step carefully around <em class="calibre4">so’jhin</em> of the Imperial family, and speak to <em class="calibre4">so’jhin</em> of the Empress herself as to equals. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> Blood, the; <em class="calibre4">da’covale</em>.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Standardbearer:</strong> A Seanchan rank equivalent to Bannerman.</p>
<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Succession:</strong> In general, when one House succeeds another on the throne. In Andor, the term is widely used for the struggle for the throne that arose upon Mordrellen’s death. Tigraine’s disappearance had left Mantear <a id="page_1095" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>without a Daughter-Heir, and two years passed before Morgase, of House Trakand, took the throne. Outside of Andor, this conflict was known as the Third War of Andoran Succession.</p>

<p class="para4"><strong class="calibre14">Tarabon:</strong> A nation on the Aryth Ocean. Once a great trading nation, a source of rugs, dyes and the Guild of Illuminators’ fireworks among other things, Tarabon has fallen on hard times. Racked by anarchy and civil war compounded by simultaneous wars against Arad Doman and the Dragonsworn, it was ripe for the picking when the Seanchan arrived. It is now firmly under Seanchan control, the chapter house of the Guild of Illuminators has been destroyed and the Illuminators themselves have been made <em class="calibre4">da’covale</em>. Most Taraboners appear grateful that the Seanchan have restored order, and since the Seanchan allow them to continue living their lives with minimal interference, they have no desire to bring on more warfare by trying to chase the Seanchan out. There are, however, some lords and soldiers who remain outside the Seanchan sphere of influence and are fighting to reclaim their land.</p>

Officers have wings worked on the sides of their helmets, and rank is denoted by slender plumes.</p>
