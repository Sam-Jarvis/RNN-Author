<p class="chapterOpenerText">Mandarb’s hooves beat a familiar rhythm on broken ground as Lan Mandragoran rode toward his death. The dry air made his throat rough and the earth was sprinkled white with crystals of salt that precipitated from below. Distant red rock formations loomed to the north, where sickness stained them. Blight marks, a creeping dark lichen.</p>
<p class="para">He continued riding east, parallel to the Blight. This was still Saldaea, where his wife had deposited him, only narrowly keeping her promise to take him to the Borderlands. It had stretched before him for a long time, this road. He’d turned away from it twenty years ago, agreeing to follow Moiraine, but he’d always known he would return. This was what it meant to bear the name of his fathers, the sword on his hip, and the <span class="italic1">hadori</span> on his head.</p>
<p class="para">This rocky section of northern Saldaea was known as the Proska Flats. It was a grim place to ride; not a plant grew on it. The wind blew from the north, carrying with it a foul stench. Like that of a deep, sweltering mire bloated with corpses. The sky overhead stormed dark, brooding.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">That woman,</span> Lan thought, shaking his head. How quickly Nynaeve had learned to talk, and think, like an Aes Sedai. Riding to his death didn’t pain him, but knowing she feared for him…that did hurt. Very badly.</p>
<p class="para">He hadn’t seen another person in days. The Saldaeans had fortifications to the south, but the land here was scarred with broken ravines that made it difficult for Trollocs to assault; they preferred attacking near Maradon.</p>
<p class="para">That was no reason to relax, however. One should never relax, this close to the Blight. He noted a hilltop; that would be a good place for a scout’s post. He made certain to watch it for any sign of movement. He rode around a depression in the ground, just in case it held waiting ambushers. He kept his hand on his bow. Once he traveled a little farther eastward, he’d cut down into Saldaea and cross Kandor on its good roadways. Then—</p>
<p class="para">Some gravel rolled down a hillside nearby.</p>
<p class="para">Lan carefully slid an arrow from the quiver tied to Mandarb’s saddle. Where had the sound come from? <span class="italic1">To the right,</span> he decided. Southward. The hillside there; someone was approaching from behind it.</p>
<p class="para">Lan did not stop Mandarb. If the hoofbeats changed, it would give warning. He quietly raised the bow, feeling the sweat of his fingers inside his fawn-hide gloves. He nocked the arrow and pulled carefully, raising it to his cheek, breathing in its scent. Goose feathers, resin.</p>
<p class="para">A figure walked around the southern hillside. The man froze, an old, shaggy-maned packhorse walking around beside him and continuing on ahead. It stopped only when the rope at its neck grew taut.</p>
<p class="para">The man wore a laced tan shirt and dusty breeches. He had a sword at his waist, and his arms were thick and strong, but he didn’t look threatening. In fact, he seemed faintly familiar.</p>
<p class="para">“Lord Mandragoran!” the man said, hastening forward, pulling his horse after. “I’ve found you at last. I assumed you’d be traveling the Kremer Road!”</p>
<p class="para">Lan lowered his bow and stopped Mandarb. “Do I know you?”</p>
<p class="para">“I brought supplies, my Lord!” The man had black hair and tanned skin. Borderlander stock, probably. He continued forward, over eager, yanking on the overloaded packhorse’s rope with a thick-fingered hand. “I figured that you wouldn’t have enough food. Tents—four of them, just in case—some water too. Feed for the horses. And—”</p>
<p class="para">“Who <span class="italic1">are</span> you?” Lan barked. “And how do you know who I am?”</p>
<p class="para">The man drew up sharply. “I’m Bulen, my Lord. From Kandor?”</p>
<p class="para">From Kandor…Lan remembered a gangly young messenger boy. With surprise, he saw the resemblance. “<span class="italic1">Bulen?</span> That was twenty years ago, man!”</p>
<p class="para">“I know, Lord Mandragoran. But when word spread in the palace that the Golden Crane was raised, I knew what I had to do. I’ve learned the sword well, my Lord. I’ve come to ride with you and—”</p>
<p class="para">“The word of my travel has spread to <span class="italic1">Aesdaishar</span>?”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, my Lord. El’Nynaeve, she came to us, you see. Told us what you’d done. Others are gathering, but I left first. Knew you’d need supplies.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Burn that woman,</span> Lan thought. And she’d made him <span class="italic1">swear</span> that he would accept those who wished to ride with him! Well, if she could play games with the truth, then so could he. Lan had said he’d take anyone who wished to <span class="italic1">ride</span> with him. This man was not mounted. Therefore, Lan could refuse him. A petty distinction, but twenty years with Aes Sedai had taught him a few things about how to watch one’s words.</p>
<p class="para">“Go back to Aesdaishar,” Lan said. “Tell them that my wife was wrong, and I have <span class="italic1">not</span> raised the Golden Crane.”</p>
<p class="para">“But—”</p>
<p class="para">“I don’t need you, son. Away with you.” Lan’s heels nudged Mandarb into a walk, and he passed the man standing on the road. For a few moments, Lan thought that his order would be obeyed, though the evasion of his oath pricked at his conscience.</p>
<p class="para">“My father was Malkieri,” Bulen said from behind.</p>
<p class="para">Lan continued on.</p>
<p class="para">“He died when I was five,” Bulen called. “He married a Kandori woman. They both fell to bandits. I don’t remember much of them. Only something my father told me: that someday, we would fight for the Golden Crane. All I have of him is this.”</p>
<p class="para">Lan couldn’t help but look back as Mandarb continued to walk away. Bulen held up a thin strap of leather, the <span class="italic1">hadori</span>, worn on the head of a Malkieri sworn to fight the Shadow.</p>
<p class="para">“I would wear the <span class="italic1">hadori</span> of my father,” Bulen called, voice growing louder. “But I have nobody to ask if I may. That is the tradition, is it not? Someone has to give me the right to don it. Well, I would fight the Shadow all my days.” He looked down at the <span class="italic1">hadori</span>, then back up again and yelled, “I would stand against the darkness, al’Lan Mandragoran! Will you tell me I cannot?”</p>
<p class="para">“Go to the Dragon Reborn,” Lan called to him. “Or to your queen’s army. Either of them will take you.”</p>
<p class="para">“And you? You will ride all the way to the Seven Towers without supplies?”</p>
<p class="para">“I’ll forage.”</p>
<p class="para">“Pardon me, my Lord, but have you <span class="italic1">seen</span> the land these days? The Blight creeps farther and farther south. Nothing grows, even in once-fertile lands. Game is scarce.”</p>
<p class="para">Lan hesitated. He reined Mandarb in.</p>
<p class="para">“All those years ago,” Bulen called, walking forward, his packhorse walking behind him. “I hardly knew who you were, though I know you lost someone dear to you among us. I’ve spent years cursing myself for not serving you better. I swore that I would stand with you someday.” He walked up beside Lan. “I ask you because I have no father. May I wear the <span class="italic1">hadori</span> and fight at your side, al’Lan Mandragoran? My King?”</p>
<p class="para">Lan breathed out slowly, stilling his emotions. <span class="italic1">Nynaeve, when next I see you…</span> But he would not see her again. He tried not to dwell upon that.</p>
<p class="para">He <span class="italic1">had</span> made an oath. Aes Sedai wiggled around their promises, but did that give him the same right? No. A man was his honor. He could not deny Bulen.</p>
<p class="para">“We ride anonymously,” Lan said. “We do <span class="italic1">not</span> raise the Golden Crane. You tell nobody who I am.”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, my Lord,” Bulen said.</p>
<p class="para">“Then wear that <span class="italic1">hadori</span> with pride,” Lan said. “Too few keep to the old ways. And yes, you may join me.”</p>
<p class="para">Lan nudged Mandarb into motion, Bulen following on foot. And the one became two.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Perrin slammed his hammer against the red-hot length of iron. Sparks sprayed into the air like incandescent insects. Sweat beaded on his face.</p>
<p class="para">Some people found the clang of metal against metal grating. Not Perrin. That sound was soothing. He raised the hammer and slammed it down.</p>
<p class="para">Sparks. Flying chips of light that bounced off his leather vest and his apron. With each strike, the walls of the room—sturdy leatherleaf wood—<span class="italic1">fuzzed,</span> responding to the beats of metal on metal. He was dreaming, though he wasn’t in the wolf dream. He knew this, though he didn’t know <span class="italic1">how</span> he knew.</p>
<p class="para">The windows were dark; the only light was that of the deep red fire burning on his right. Two bars of iron simmered in the coals, waiting their turn at the forge. Perrin slammed the hammer down again.</p>
<p class="para">This was peace. This was <span class="italic1">home</span>.</p>
<p class="para">He was making something important. So very important. It was a piece of something larger. The first step to creating something was to figure out its parts. Master Luhhan had taught Perrin that on his first day at the forge. You couldn’t make a spade without understanding how the handle fit to the blade. You couldn’t make a hinge without knowing how the two leaves moved with the pin. You couldn’t even make a nail without knowing its parts: head, shaft, point.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Understand the pieces, Perrin.</span></p>
<p class="para">A wolf lay in the corner of the room. It was large and grizzled, fur the color of a pale gray river stone, and scarred from a lifetime of battles and hunts. The wolf laid its head on its paws, watching Perrin. That was natural. Of <span class="italic1">course</span> there was a wolf in the corner. Why wouldn’t there be? It was Hopper.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin worked, enjoying the deep, burning heat of the forge, the feel of the sweat trailing down his arms, the scent of the fire. He shaped the length of iron, one blow for every second beat of his heart. The metal never grew cool, but instead retained its malleable red-yellow.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">What am I making?</span> Perrin picked up the length of glowing iron with his tongs. The air warped around it.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Pound, pound, pound,</span> Hopper sent, communicating in images and scents. <span class="italic1">Like a pup jumping at butterflies.</span></p>
<p class="para">Hopper didn’t see the point of reshaping metal, and found it amusing that men did such things. To a wolf, a thing was what it was. Why go through so much effort to change it into something else?</p>
<p class="para">Perrin set the length of iron aside. It cooled immediately, fading from yellow, to orange, to crimson, to a dull black. Perrin had pounded it into a misshapen nugget, perhaps the size of two fists. Master Luhhan would be ashamed to see such shoddy work. Perrin needed to discover what he was making soon, before his master returned.</p>
<p class="para">No. That was wrong. The dream shook, and the walls grew misty.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">I’m not an apprentice.</span> Perrin raised a thick-gloved hand to his head. <span class="italic1">I’m not in the Two Rivers any longer. I’m a man, a married man.</span></p>
<p class="para">Perrin grabbed the lump of unshaped iron with his tongs, thrusting it down on the anvil. It flared to life with heat. <span class="italic1">Everything is still wrong.</span> Perrin smashed his hammer down. <span class="italic1">It should all be better now! But it isn’t. It seems worse somehow.</span></p>
<p class="para">He continued pounding. He hated those rumors that the men in camp whispered about him. Perrin had been sick and Berelain had cared for him. That was the end of it. But still those whispers continued.</p>
<p class="para">He slammed his hammer down over and over. Sparks flew in the air like splashes of water, far too many to come from one length of iron. He gave one final strike, then breathed in and out.</p>
<p class="para">The lump hadn’t changed. Perrin growled and grabbed the tongs, setting the lump aside and taking a fresh bar from the coals. He <span class="italic1">had</span> to finish this piece. It was so important. But what was he making?</p>
<p class="para">He started pounding. <span class="italic1">I need to spend time with Faile, to figure things out, remove the awkwardness between us. But there’s no time!</span> Those Light-blinded fools around him couldn’t take care of themselves. Nobody in the Two Rivers ever needed a lord before.</p>
<p class="para">He worked for a time, then held up the second chunk of iron. It cooled, turning into a misshapen, flattened length about as long as his forearm. Another shoddy piece. He set it aside.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">If you are unhappy,</span> Hopper sent, <span class="italic1">take your she and leave. If you do not wish to lead the pack, another will.</span> The wolf’s sending came as images of running across open fields, stalks of grain brushing along his snout. An open sky, a cool breeze, a thrill and lust for adventure. The scents of new rain, of wild pastures.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin reached his tongs into the coals for the final bar of iron. It burned a distant, dangerous yellow. “I can’t leave.” He held the bar up toward the wolf. “It would mean giving in to being a wolf. It would mean losing myself. I won’t do that.”</p>
<p class="para">He held the near-molten steel between them, and Hopper watched it, yellow pinpricks of light reflecting in the wolf’s eyes. This dream was so odd. In the past, Perrin’s ordinary dreams and the wolf dream had been separate. What did this blending mean?</p>
<p class="para">Perrin was afraid. He’d come to a precarious truce with the wolf inside of him. Growing too close to the wolves was dangerous, but that hadn’t prevented him turning to them when seeking Faile. Anything for Faile. In doing so, Perrin had nearly gone mad, and had even tried to kill Hopper.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin wasn’t nearly as in control as he’d assumed. The wolf within him could still reign.</p>
<p class="para">Hopper yawned, letting his tongue loll. He smelled of sweet amusement.</p>
<p class="para">“This is not funny.” Perrin set the final bar aside without working on it. It cooled, taking on the shape of a thin rectangle, not unlike the beginnings of a hinge.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Problems are not amusing, Young Bull,</span> Hopper agreed. <span class="italic1">But you are climbing back and forth over the same wall. Come. Let us run.</span></p>
<p class="para">Wolves lived in the moment; though they remembered the past and seemed to have an odd sense for the future, they didn’t worry about either. Not as men did. Wolves ran free, chasing the winds. To join them would be to ignore pain, sorrow and frustration. To be free…</p>
<p class="para">That freedom would cost Perrin too much. He’d lose Faile, would lose his very <span class="italic1">self</span>. He didn’t want to be a wolf. He wanted to be a man. “Is there a way to reverse what has happened to me?”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Reverse?</span> Hopper cocked his head. To go backward was not a way of wolves.</p>
<p class="para">“Can I…” Perrin struggled to explain. “Can I run so far that the wolves cannot hear me?”</p>
<p class="para">Hopper seemed confused. No. “Confused” did not convey the pained sendings that came from Hopper. Nothingness, the scent of rotting meat, wolves howling in agony. Being cut off was not a thing Hopper could conceive.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin’s mind grew fuzzy. Why had he stopped forging? He had to finish. Master Luhhan would be disappointed! Those lumps were terrible. He should hide them. Create something else, show he <span class="italic1">was</span> capable. He <span class="italic1">could</span> forge. Couldn’t he?</p>
<p class="para">A hissing came from beside him. Perrin turned, surprised to see that one of the quenching barrels beside the hearth was boiling. <span class="italic1">Of course,</span> he thought. <span class="italic1">The first pieces I finished. I dropped them in there.</span></p>
<p class="para">Suddenly anxious, Perrin grabbed his tongs and reached into the turbulent water, steam engulfing his face. He found something at the bottom and brought it out with his tongs: a chunk of white-hot metal.</p>
<p class="para">The glow faded. The chunk was actually a small steel figurine in the shape of a tall, thin man with a sword tied to his back. Each line on the figure was detailed, the ruffles of the shirt, the leather bands on the hilt of the tiny sword. But the face was distorted, the mouth open in a twisted scream.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Aram,</span> Perrin thought. <span class="italic1">His name was Aram.</span></p>
<p class="para">Perrin couldn’t show <span class="italic1">this</span> to Master Luhhan! Why had he created such a thing?</p>
<p class="para">The figurine’s mouth opened farther, screaming soundlessly. Perrin cried out, dropping it from the tongs and jumping back. The figurine fell to the wood floor and shattered.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Why do you think so much about that one?</span> Hopper yawned a wide-jawed wolf yawn, tongue curling. <span class="italic1">It is common that a young pup challenges the pack leader. He was foolish, and you defeated him.</span></p>
<p class="para">“No,” Perrin whispered. “It is not common for humans. Not for friends.”</p>
<p class="para">The wall of the forge suddenly melted away, becoming smoke. It felt natural for that to happen. Outside, Perrin saw an open, daylit street. A city with broken-windowed shops.</p>
<p class="para">“Malden,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para">A smoky, translucent image of himself stood outside. The image wore no coat; his bare arms bulged with muscles. He kept his beard short, but it made him look older, more intense. Did Perrin really look <span class="italic1">that</span> imposing? A squat fortress of a man with golden eyes that seemed to glow, carrying a gleaming half-moon axe as large as a man’s head.</p>
<p class="para">There was something wrong about that axe. Perrin stepped out of the smithy, passing through the shadowy version of himself. When he did, he became that image, axe heavy in his hand, work clothes vanishing and battle gear replacing it.</p>
<p class="para">He took off running. Yes, this <span class="italic1">was</span> Malden. There were Aiel in the streets. He’d lived this battle, though he was much calmer this time. Before, he’d been lost in the thrill of fighting and of seeking Faile. He stopped in the street. “This is wrong. I carried my hammer into Malden. I threw the axe away.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">A horn or a hoof, Young Bull, does it matter which one you use to hunt?</span> Hopper was sitting in the sunlit street beside him.</p>
<p class="para">“Yes. It matters. It does to me.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">And yet you use them the same way.</span></p>
<p class="para">A pair of Shaido Aiel appeared around a corner. They were watching something to the left, something Perrin couldn’t see. He ran to attack them.</p>
<p class="para">He sheared through the chin of one, then swung the spike on the axe into the chest of the other. It was a brutal, terrible attack, and all three of them ended on the ground. It took several stabs from the spike to kill the second Shaido.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin stood up. He did remember killing those two Aiel, though he had done it with hammer and knife. He didn’t regret their deaths. Sometimes a man needed to fight, and that was that. Death was terrible, but that didn’t stop it from being necessary. In fact, it had been wonderful to clash with the Aiel. He’d felt like a wolf on the hunt.</p>
<p class="para">When Perrin fought, he came close to becoming someone else. And that was dangerous.</p>
<p class="para">He looked accusingly at Hopper, who lounged on a street corner. “Why are you making me dream this?”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Making you?</span> Hopper asked. <span class="italic1">This is not my dream, Young Bull. Do you see my jaws on your neck, forcing you to think it?</span></p>
<p class="para">Perrin’s axe streamed with blood. He knew what was coming next. He turned. From behind, Aram approached, murder in his eyes. Half of the former Tinker’s face was coated in blood, and it dripped from his chin, staining his red-striped coat.</p>
<p class="para">Aram swung his sword for Perrin’s neck, the steel hissing in the air. Perrin stepped back. He refused to fight the boy again.</p>
<p class="para">The shadowy version of himself split off, leaving the real Perrin in his blacksmith’s clothing. The shadow exchanged blows with Aram. <span class="italic1">The Prophet explained it to me…You’re really Shadowspawn…. I have to rescue the Lady Faile from you….</span></p>
<p class="para">The shadowy Perrin changed, suddenly, into a wolf. It leaped, fur nearly as dark as that of a Shadowbrother, and ripped out Aram’s throat.</p>
<p class="para">“No! It didn’t happen like that!”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">It is a dream,</span> Hopper sent.</p>
<p class="para">“But I didn’t kill him,” Perrin protested. “Some Aiel shot him with arrows right before….”</p>
<p class="para">Right before Aram would have killed Perrin.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">The horn, the hoof, or the tooth,</span> Hopper sent, turning and ambling toward a building. Its wall vanished, revealing Master Luhhan’s smithy inside. <span class="italic1">Does it matter? The dead are dead. Two-legs do not come here, not usually, once they die. I do not know where it is that they go.</span></p>
<p class="para">Perrin looked down at Aram’s body. “I should have taken that fool sword from him the moment he picked it up. I should have sent him back to his family.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Does not a cub deserve his fangs?</span> Hopper asked, genuinely confused. <span class="italic1">Why would you pull them?</span></p>
<p class="para">“It is a thing of men,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Things of two-legs, of men. Always, it is a thing of men to you. What of things of wolves?</span></p>
<p class="para">“I am not a wolf.”</p>
<p class="para">Hopper entered the forge, and Perrin reluctantly followed. The barrel was still boiling. The wall returned, and Perrin was once again wearing his leather vest and apron, holding his tongs.</p>
<p class="para">He stepped over and pulled out another figurine. This one was in the shape of Tod al’Caar. As it cooled, Perrin found that the face wasn’t distorted like Aram’s, though the lower half of the figurine was unformed, still a block of metal. The figurine continued to glow, faintly reddish, after Perrin set it down on the floor. He thrust his tongs back into the water and pulled free a figure of Jori Congar, then one of Azi al’Thone.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin went to the bubbling barrel time and time again, pulling out figurine after figurine. After the way of dreams, fetching them all took both a brief second and what seemed like hours. When he finished, hundreds of figurines stood on the floor facing him. Watching. Each steel figure was lit with a tiny fire inside, as if waiting to feel the forger’s hammer.</p>
<p class="para">But figurines like this wouldn’t be forged; they’d be cast. “What does it mean?” Perrin sat down on a stool.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Mean?</span> Hopper opened his mouth in a wolf laugh. <span class="italic1">It means there are many little men on the floor, none of which you can eat. Your kind is too fond of rocks and what is inside of them.</span></p>
<p class="para">The figurines seemed accusing. Around them lay the broken shards of Aram. Those pieces seemed to be growing larger. The shattered hands began working, clawing on the ground. The shards all became little hands, climbing toward Perrin, reaching for him.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin gasped, leaping to his feet. He heard laughter in the distance, ringing closer, shaking the building. Hopper jumped, slamming into him. And then…</p>
<p class="para">Perrin started awake. He was back in his tent, in the field where they’d been camped for a few days now. They’d run across a bubble of evil the week before that had caused angry red, oily serpents to wiggle from the ground all through camp. Several hundred were sick from their bites; Aes Sedai Healing had been enough to keep most of them alive, but not restore them completely.</p>
<p class="para">Faile slept beside Perrin, peaceful. Outside, one of his men tapped a post to count off the hour. Three taps. Still hours until dawn.</p>
<p class="para">Perrin’s heart pounded softly, and he raised a hand to his bare chest. He half-expected an army of tiny metal hands to crawl out from beneath his bedroll.</p>
<p class="para">Eventually, he forced his eyes closed and tried to relax. This time, sleep was very elusive.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Graendal sipped at her wine, which glistened in a goblet trimmed with a web of silver around the sides. The goblet had been crafted with drops of blood caught in a ring pattern within the crystal. Frozen forever, tiny bubbles of brilliant red.</p>
<p class="para">“We should be <span class="italic1">doing</span> something,” Aran’gar said, lounging on the chaise and eyeing one of Graendal’s pets with a predatory hunger as he passed. “I don’t know how you stand it, staying so far from important events, like some scholar holed up in a dusty corner.”</p>
<p class="para">Graendal arched an eyebrow. A scholar? In some dusty <span class="italic1">corner</span>? Natrin’s Barrow was modest compared to some palaces she had known, during the previous Age, but it was hardly a hovel. The furnishings were fine, the walls bearing an arching pattern of thick, dark hardwoods, the marble of the floor sparkling with inlaid chips of mother-of-pearl and gold.</p>
<p class="para">Aran’gar was just trying to provoke her. Graendal put the irritation out of her mind. The fire burned low in the hearth, but the pair of doors—leading out onto a fortified walkway three stories in the air—was open, letting in a crisp mountain breeze. She rarely left a window or door open to the outside, but today she liked the contrast: warmth from one side, a cool breeze from the other.</p>
<p class="para">Life was about <span class="italic1">feeling</span>. Touches on your skin, both passionate and icy. Anything other than the normal, the average, the lukewarm.</p>
<p class="para">“Are you listening to me?” Aran’gar asked.</p>
<p class="para">“I always listen,” Graendal said, setting aside her goblet as she sat on her own chaise. She wore a golden, enveloping dress, sheer but buttoned to the neck. What marvelous fashions these Domani had, ideal for teasing while revealing.</p>
<p class="para">“I <span class="italic1">loathe</span> being so removed from things,” Aran’gar continued. “This Age is exciting. Primitive people can be so interesting.” The voluptuous, ivory-skinned woman arched her back, stretching arms toward the wall. “We’re missing all of the excitement.”</p>
<p class="para">“Excitement is best viewed from a distance,” Graendal said. “I would think you’d understand that.”</p>
<p class="para">Aran’gar fell silent. The Great Lord had not been pleased with her for losing control of Egwene al’Vere.</p>
<p class="para">“Well,” Aran’gar said, standing. “If that is your thought on it, I will seek more interesting evening sport.”</p>
<p class="para">Her voice was cool; perhaps their alliance was wearing thin. In that case, it was time for reinforcement. Graendal opened herself and accepted the Great Lord’s dominance of her, feeling the thrilling ecstasy of his power, his passion, his very <span class="italic1">substance</span>. It was so much more intoxicating than the One Power, this raging torrent of fire.</p>
<p class="para">It threatened to overwhelm and consume her, and despite being filled with the True Power, she could channel only a thin trickle of it. A gift to her from Moridin. No, from the Great Lord. Best not to begin associating those two in her mind. For now, Moridin was Nae’blis. For now only.</p>
<p class="para">Graendal wove a ribbon of Air. Working with the True Power was similar, yet not identical, to working with the One Power. A weave of the True Power would often function in a slightly different way, or have an unanticipated side effect. And there were some weaves that could <span class="italic1">only</span> be crafted by the True Power.</p>
<p class="para">The Great Lord’s essence forced the Pattern, straining it and leaving it scarred. Even something the Creator had designed to be eternal could be unraveled using the Great Lord’s energies. It bespoke an eternal truth—something as close to being sacred as Graendal was willing to accept. Whatever the Creator could build, the Great Lord could destroy.</p>
<p class="para">She snaked her ribbon of Air through the room toward Aran’gar. The other Chosen had stepped out onto the balcony; Graendal forbade the creation of gateways inside, lest they damage her pets or her furnishings. Graendal lifted the ribbon of Air up to Aran’gar’s cheek and caressed it delicately.</p>
<p class="para">Aran’gar froze. She turned, suspicious, but it took only a moment for her eyes to open wide. She wouldn’t have felt the goose bumps on her arms to indicate Graendal was channeling. The True Power gave no hint, no sign. Male or female, no one could see or sense the weaves—not unless he or she had been granted the privilege of channeling the True Power.</p>
<p class="para">“What?” the woman asked. “How? Moridin is—”</p>
<p class="para">“Nae’blis,” Graendal said. “Yes. But once the Great Lord’s favor in this regard was not confined to the Nae’blis.” She continued to caress Aran’gar’s cheek, and the woman flushed.</p>
<p class="para">Aran’gar, like the other Chosen, lusted for the True Power while fearing it at the same time—dangerous, pleasurable, seductive. When Graendal withdrew her line of Air, Aran’gar stepped back into the room and returned to her chaise, then sent one of Graendal’s pets to fetch her toy Aes Sedai. Lust still burned Aran’gar’s cheeks; likely she would use Delana to distract herself. Aran’gar seemed to find it amusing to force the homely Aes Sedai into subservience.</p>
<p class="para">Delana arrived moments later; she always remained nearby. The Shienaran woman was pale-haired and stout, with thick limbs. Graendal’s lips turned down. Such an unpretty thing. Not like Aran’gar herself. She’d have made an ideal pet. Maybe someday Graendal would have the chance to make her into one.</p>
<p class="para">Aran’gar and Delana began to exchange affections on the chaise. Aran’gar was insatiable, a fact Graendal had exploited on numerous occasions, the lure of the True Power being only the latest. Of course, Graendal enjoyed pleasures herself, but she made certain that people thought she was far more self-indulgent than she was. If you knew what people expected you to be, you could use those expectations. It—</p>
<p class="para">Graendal froze as an alarm went off in her ears, the sound of crashing waves beating against one another. Aran’gar continued her pleasures; she couldn’t hear the sound. The weave was very specific, placed where her servants could trip it to give her warning.</p>
<p class="para">Graendal climbed to her feet, strolling around the side of the room, giving no indication of urgency. At the door, she sent a few of her pets in to help distract Aran’gar. Best to discover the scope of the problem before involving her.</p>
<p class="para">Graendal walked down a hallway hung with golden chandeliers and ornamented with mirrors. She was halfway down a stairwell when Garumand—the captain of her palace guard—came bustling up. He was Saldaean, a distant cousin of the Queen, and wore a thick mustache on his lean, handsome face. Compulsion had made him utterly loyal, of course.</p>
<p class="para">“Great Lady,” he said, panting. “A man has been captured approaching the palace. My men recognize him as a minor lord from Bandar Eban, a member of House Ramshalan.”</p>
<p class="para">Graendal frowned, then waved for Garumand to follow as she made her way to one of her audience chambers—a small, windowless room decorated in crimson. She wove a ward against eavesdropping, then sent Garumand to bring the intruder.</p>
<p class="para">Soon, he returned with some guards and a Domani man dressed in bright greens and blues, a beauty mark shaped like a bell on his cheek. His neat, short beard was tied with tiny bells, and they jingled as the guards shoved him forward. He brushed off his arms, glaring at the soldiers, and straightened his ruffled shirt. “Am I to understand that I have been delivered to—”</p>
<p class="para">He cut off with a choking sound as Graendal wrapped him in weaves of Air and dug into his mind. He stuttered, eyes growing unfocused.</p>
<p class="para">“I am Piqor Ramshalan,” he said in a monotone. “I have been sent by the Dragon Reborn to seek an alliance with the merchant family residing in this fortification. As I am smarter and more clever than al’Thor, he needs me to build alliances for him. He is particularly afraid of those living in this palace, which I find ridiculous, since it is distant and unimportant.</p>
<p class="para">“Obviously, the Dragon Reborn is a weak man. I believe that by gaining his confidence, I can be chosen as the next King of Arad Doman. I wish for you to make an alliance with me, not with him, and will promise you favors once I am king. I d—”</p>
<p class="para">Graendal waved a hand and he cut off in midword. She folded her arms, hairs bristling as she shivered.</p>
<p class="para">The Dragon Reborn had found her.</p>
<p class="para">He had sent a distraction for her.</p>
<p class="para">He thought he could manipulate her.</p>
<p class="para">She instantly wove a gateway to one of her most secure hiding places. Cool air wafted in from an area of the world where it was morning, not early evening. Best to be careful. Best to flee. And yet…</p>
<p class="para">She hesitated. <span class="italic1">He must know pain…he must know frustration…he must know anguish. Bring these to him. You will be rewarded.</span></p>
<p class="para">Aran’gar had fled from her place among Aes Sedai, foolishly allowing herself to be sensed channeling <span class="italic1">saidin</span>. She still bore punishment for her failure. If Graendal left now—discarding a chance to twist al’Thor about himself—would she be similarly punished?</p>
<p class="para">“What is this?” Aran’gar’s voice asked outside. “Let me through, you fools. Graendal? What are you doing?”</p>
<p class="para">Graendal hissed softly, then closed the gateway and composed herself. She nodded for Aran’gar to be allowed into the room. The lithe woman stepped up to the doorway, eyeing—and assessing—Ramshalan. Graendal shouldn’t have sent the pets to her; the move had likely made her suspicious.</p>
<p class="para">“Al’Thor has found me,” Graendal said curtly. “He sent this one to make an ‘alliance’ with me, but did not tell him who I was. Al’Thor likely wants me to think that this man stumbled upon me accidentally.”</p>
<p class="para">Aran’gar pursed her lips. “So you’ll flee? Run from the center of excitement again?”</p>
<p class="para">“This, from you?”</p>
<p class="para">“I was surrounded by enemies. Flight was my only option.” It sounded like a practiced line.</p>
<p class="para">Words like those were a challenge. Aran’gar would serve <span class="italic1">her</span>. Perhaps…“Does that Aes Sedai of yours know Compulsion?”</p>
<p class="para">Aran’gar shrugged. “She’s been trained in it. She’s passably skilled.”</p>
<p class="para">“Fetch her.”</p>
<p class="para">Aran’gar raised an eyebrow, but nodded in deference, disappearing to run the errand herself—probably to gain time to think. Graendal sent a servant for one of her dove cages. They arrived with the bird before Aran’gar was back, and Graendal carefully wove the True Power—once again thrilling in the rush of holding it—and crafted a complex weave of Spirit. Could she remember how to do this? It had been so long.</p>
<p class="para">She overlaid the weave on the bird’s mind. Her vision seemed to <span class="italic1">snap</span>. In a moment, she could see two images in front of her—the world as she saw it and a shadowed version of what the bird saw. If she focused, she could turn her attention to one or the other.</p>
<p class="para">It made her mind hurt. The vision of a bird was entirely different from that of a human being: She could see a much larger field, and the colors were so vivid as to be nearly blinding, but the view was blurry, and she had trouble judging distance.</p>
<p class="para">She tucked the bird’s sight into the back of her head. A dove would be unobtrusive, but using one was more difficult than a raven or a rat, the Great Lord’s own favored eyes. The weave worked better on those than it did other animals. Though, most vermin that watched for the Great Lord had to report back before he knew what they’d seen. Why that was, she was not certain—the intricacies of the True Power’s special weaves never had made much sense to her. Not as much as they had to Aginor, at least.</p>
<p class="para">Aran’gar returned with her Aes Sedai, who was looking increasingly timid these days. She curtsied low to Graendal, then remained in a subservient posture. Graendal carefully removed her Compulsion from Ramshalan, leaving him dazed and disoriented.</p>
<p class="para">“What is it you wish me to do, Great One?” Delana asked, glancing at Aran’gar and then back at Graendal.</p>
<p class="para">“Compulsion,” Graendal said. “As intricate and as complex as you can make it.”</p>
<p class="para">“What do you wish it to do, Great Lady?”</p>
<p class="para">“Leave him able to act like himself,” Graendal said. “But remove all memory of events here. Replace them with a memory of talking to a merchant family and securing their alliance. Add a few other random requirements on him, whatever occurs to you.”</p>
<p class="para">Delana frowned, but she had learned not to question the Chosen. Graendal folded her arms and tapped one finger as she watched the Aes Sedai work. She felt increasingly nervous. Al’Thor knew where she was. Would he attack? No, he wouldn’t harm women. That particular failing was an important one. It meant she had time to respond. Didn’t she?</p>
<p class="para">How had he managed to trace her to this palace? She had covered herself <span class="italic1">perfectly</span>. The only minions she’d let out of her sight were under Compulsion so heavy that it would kill them to remove it. Could it be that the Aes Sedai he kept with him—Nynaeve, the woman gifted in Healing—had been able to undermine and read Graendal’s weaves?</p>
<p class="para">Graendal needed time, and she needed to discover what al’Thor knew. If Nynaeve al’Meara had the skill needed to read Compulsions, that was dangerous. Graendal needed to lay him a false trail, delay him—hence her requirement that Delana create a thick Compulsion with strange provisions in it.</p>
<p class="para">Bring him agony. Graendal could do that.</p>
<p class="para">“You next,” she said to Aran’gar once Delana had finished. “Something convoluted. I want al’Thor and his Aes Sedai to find the touch of a man on the mind.” That would confuse them further.</p>
<p class="para">Aran’gar shrugged, but focused as if laying down a thick and complex Compulsion on the unfortunate Ramshalan’s mind. He was <span class="italic1">somewhat</span> pretty. Did al’Thor assume she’d want him for one of her pets? Did he even remember enough of being Lews Therin to know that about her? Her reports on how much of his old life he remembered were contradictory, but he seemed to be recalling more and more. That was what worried her. Lews Therin could have tracked her to this palace, perhaps. She’d never expected that al’Thor would be able to do the same.</p>
<p class="para">Aran’gar finished.</p>
<p class="para">“Now,” Graendal said, releasing her weaves of Air and speaking to Ramshalan, “return and tell the Dragon Reborn of your success here.”</p>
<p class="para">Ramshalan blinked, shaking his head. “I…Yes, my Lady. Yes, I believe the ties we made today will be extremely beneficial to both of us.” He smiled. Weak-minded fool. “Perhaps we should dine and drink to our success, Lady Basene? It has been a wearying trip to see you, and I—”</p>
<p class="para">“Go,” Graendal said coldly.</p>
<p class="para">“Very well. You will be rewarded when I am king!”</p>
<p class="para">Her guards led him away, and he began whistling with a self-satisfied air. Graendal sat down and closed her eyes; several of her soldiers stepped over to guard her, their boots soft on the thick rug.</p>
<p class="para">She looked through the dove’s eyes, accustoming herself to its strange way of seeing. At her order, a servant picked it up and carried it to a window in the hallway outside the room. The bird hopped onto the windowsill. Graendal gave it a soft nudge to go forward; she wasn’t practiced enough to take control completely. Flying was far more difficult than it looked.</p>
<p class="para">The dove flapped out of the window. The sun was lowering behind the mountains, outlining them in angry red and orange, and the lake below fell into a deep, shadowy blue-black. The view was thrilling but nauseating as the dove soared up into the air and landed on one of the towers.</p>
<p class="para">Ramshalan eventually walked out of the gates below. Graendal nudged the dove and it leaped off the tower, plunging toward the ground. Graendal gritted her teeth at the stomach-churning descent, the palace stoneworks becoming a blur. The dove leveled out and flapped after Ramshalan. He seemed to be grumbling to himself, though she could make out only rudimentary sounds through the dove’s unfamiliar earholes.</p>
<p class="para">She followed him for some time through the darkening woods. An owl would have been better, but she didn’t have one captive. She chided herself for that. The dove flew from branch to branch. The forest floor was a messy tangle of underbrush and fallen pine needles. She found that distinctly unpleasant.</p>
<p class="para">There was light up ahead. It was faint, but the dove’s eyes could easily pick out light and shadow, motion and stillness. She nudged it to investigate, leaving Ramshalan.</p>
<p class="para">The light was coming from a gateway in the middle of a clear patch, spilling forth a warm glow. There were figures standing before it. One of them was al’Thor.</p>
<p class="para">Graendal felt instant panic. He <span class="italic1">was</span> here. Looking down over the ridge, toward her. Darkness within! She hadn’t known for certain if he’d be here in person, or if Ramshalan would travel through a gateway to give his report. What game was al’Thor playing? She landed her dove on a branch. Aran’gar was complaining and asking Graendal what she was seeing. She’d seen the dove, and would know what Graendal was up to.</p>
<p class="para">Graendal concentrated harder. The Dragon Reborn, the man who had once been Lews Therin Telamon. He <span class="italic1">knew</span> where she was. He had once hated her deeply; how much <span class="italic1">did</span> he remember? Did he recall her murder of Yanet?</p>
<p class="para">Al’Thor’s tame Aiel brought Ramshalan forward, and Nynaeve inspected him. Yes, that Nynaeve did seem to be able to read Compulsion. She knew what to look for, at least. She would have to die; al’Thor relied upon her; her death would bring him pain. And after her, al’Thor’s dark-haired lover.</p>
<p class="para">Graendal nudged the dove down onto a lower branch. What would al’Thor do? Graendal’s instincts said he wouldn’t dare move, not until he unraveled her plot. He acted the same now as he had during her Age; he liked to plan, to spend time building to a crescendo of an assault.</p>
<p class="para">She frowned. What was he saying? She strained, trying to make sense of the sounds. Cursed bird’s earholes—the voices sounded like croaks. <span class="italic1">Callandor?</span> Why was he talking about <span class="italic1">Callandor</span>? And a box…</p>
<p class="para">Something burst alight in his hand. The access key. Graendal gasped. He’d brought <span class="italic1">that</span> with him? It was nearly as bad as balefire.</p>
<p class="para">Suddenly she understood. She’d been played.</p>
<p class="para">Cold, terrified, she released the dove and snapped her eyes open. She was still sitting in the small, windowless room, Aran’gar leaning beside the doorway with arms folded.</p>
<p class="para">Al’Thor had sent Ramshalan in, <span class="italic1">expecting</span> him to be captured, expecting him to have Compulsion placed on him. Ramshalan’s only purpose was to give al’Thor confirmation that Graendal was in the tower.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Light! How clever he’s become.</span></p>
<p class="para">She released the True Power and embraced less-wonderful <span class="italic1">saidar</span>. Quickly! She was so unsettled that her embrace nearly failed. She was sweating.</p>
<p class="para">Go. She had to go.</p>
<p class="para">She opened a new gateway. Aran’gar turned, staring through the walls in the direction of al’Thor. “So much power! What is he doing?”</p>
<p class="para">Aran’gar. She and Delana had made the weaves of Compulsion.</p>
<p class="para">Al’Thor must think Graendal dead. If he destroyed the place and those Compulsions remained, al’Thor would know that he’d missed and that Graendal lived.</p>
<p class="para">Graendal formed two shields and slammed them into place, one for Aran’gar, one for Delana. The women gasped. Graendal tied off the weaves and bound the two in Air.</p>
<p class="para">“Graendal?” Aran’gar said, voice panicked. “What are you—”</p>
<p class="para">It was coming. Graendal leaped for the gateway, rolling through it, tumbling and ripping her dress on a branch. A blinding light rose behind her. She struggled to dismiss the gateway, and caught one glimpse of the horrified Aran’gar before everything behind was consumed in beautiful, pure whiteness.</p>
<p class="para">The gateway vanished, leaving Graendal in darkness.</p>
<p class="para">She lay, heart beating at a terrible speed, nearly blinded by the glare. She’d made the quickest gateway she could, one that led only a short distance away. She lay in the dirty underbrush atop a ridge behind the palace.</p>
<p class="para">A wave of <span class="italic1">wrongness</span> washed over her, a warping in the air, the Pattern itself rippling. A balescream, it was called—a moment when creation itself howled in pain.</p>
<p class="para">She breathed in and out, trembling. But she had to see. She had to know. She rose to her feet, left ankle twisted. She hobbled to the treeline and looked down.</p>
<p class="para">Natrin’s Barrow—the entire palace—was gone. Burned out of the Pattern. She couldn’t see al’Thor on his distant ridge, but she knew where he was.</p>
<p class="para">“You,” she growled. “You have become <span class="italic1">far</span> more dangerous than I assumed.”</p>
<p class="para">Hundreds of beautiful men and women, the finest she’d gathered, gone. Her stronghold, dozens of items of Power, her greatest ally among the Chosen. Gone. This was a disaster.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">No,</span> she thought. <span class="italic1">I live.</span> She’d anticipated him, if only by a few moments. Now he would think she was dead.</p>
<p class="para">She was suddenly the safest she’d been since escaping the Great Lord’s prison. Except, of course, that she’d just caused the death of one of the Chosen. The Great Lord would not be pleased.</p>
<p class="para">She limped away from the ridge, already planning her next move. This would have to be handled very, very carefully.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Galad Damodred, Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light, yanked his booted foot free of the ankle-deep mud with a slurping sound.</p>
<p class="para">Bitemes buzzed in the muggy air. The stench of mud and stagnant water threatened to gag him with each breath as he led his horse to drier ground on the path. Behind him trudged a long, twisting column four men wide, each one as muddied, sweaty and weary as he was.</p>
<p class="para">They were on the border of Ghealdan and Altara, in a swampy wetland where the oaks and spicewoods had given way to laurels and spidery cypress, their gnarled roots spread like spindly fingers. The stinking air was hot—despite the shade and cloud cover—and thick. It was like breathing in a foul soup. Galad steamed beneath his breastplate and mail, his conical helmet hanging from his saddle, his skin itching from the grime and salty sweat.</p>
<p class="para">Miserable though it was, this route was the best way. Asunawa would not anticipate it. Galad wiped his brow with the back of his hand and tried to walk with head high for the benefit of those who followed him. Seven thousand men, Children who had chosen him rather than the Seanchan invaders.</p>
<p class="para">Dull green moss hung from the branches, drooping like shreds of flesh from rotting corpses. Here and there the sickly grays and greens were relieved by a bright burst of tiny pink or violet flowers clustering around trickling streams. Their sudden color was unexpected, as if someone had sprinkled drops of paint on the ground.</p>
<p class="para">It was strange to find beauty in this place. Could he find the Light in his own situation as well? He feared it would not be so easy.</p>
<p class="para">He tugged Stout forward. He could hear worried conversations from behind, punctuated by the occasional curse. This place, with its stench and biting insects, would try the best of men. Those who followed Galad were unnerved by the place the world was becoming. A world where the sky was constantly clouded black, where good men died to strange twistings of the Pattern, and where Valda—the Lord Captain Commander before Galad—had turned out to be a murderer and a rapist.</p>
<p class="para">Galad shook his head. The Last Battle would soon come.</p>
<p class="para">A clinking of chain mail announced someone moving up the line. Galad glanced over his shoulder as Dain Bornhald arrived, saluted, and fell into place beside him. “Damodred,” Dain said softly, their boots squishing in mud, “perhaps we should turn back.”</p>
<p class="para">“Backward leads only to the past,” Galad said, scanning the pathway ahead. “I have thought about this much, Child Bornhald. This sky, the wasting of the land, the way the dead walk…There is no longer time to find allies and fight against the Seanchan. We must march to the Last Battle.”</p>
<p class="para">“But this swamp,” Bornhald said, glancing to the side as a large serpent slid through the underbrush. “Our maps say we should have been out of it by now.”</p>
<p class="para">“Then surely we are near the edge.”</p>
<p class="para">“Perhaps,” Dain said, a trail of sweat running from his brow down the side of his lean face, which twitched. Fortunately, he’d run out of brandy a few days back. “Unless the map is in error.”</p>
<p class="para">Galad didn’t respond. Once-good maps were proving faulty these days. Open fields would turn to broken hills, villages would vanish, pastures would be arable one day, then suddenly overgrown with vines and fungus. The swamp could indeed have spread.</p>
<p class="para">“The men are exhausted,” Bornhald said. “They’re good men—you know they are. But they are starting to complain.” He winced, as if anticipating a reprimand from Galad.</p>
<p class="para">Perhaps once he would have given one. The Children should bear their afflictions with pride. However, memories of lessons Morgase had taught—lessons he hadn’t understood in his youth—were nagging at him. Lead by example. Require strength, but first show it.</p>
<p class="para">Galad nodded. They were nearing a dry clearing. “Gather the men. I will speak to those at the front. Have my words recorded, then passed to those behind.”</p>
<p class="para">Bornhald looked perplexed, but did as commanded. Galad stepped off to the side, climbing up a small hill. He placed his hand on the hilt of his sword, inspecting his men as the companies at the front gathered around. They stood with slouched postures, legs muddied. Hands flailed at bitemes or scratched at collars.</p>
<p class="para">“We are Children of the Light,” Galad announced, once they were gathered. “These are the darkest days of men. Days when hope is weak, days when death reigns. But it is on the deepest nights when light is most glorious. During the day, a brilliant beacon can appear weak. But when all other lights fail, it will guide!</p>
<p class="para">“<span class="italic1">We</span> are that beacon. This mire is an affliction. But we are the Children of the Light, and our afflictions are our strength. We are hunted by those who should love us, and other pathways lead to our graves. And so we will go forward. For those we must protect, for the Last Battle, for the Light!</p>
<p class="para">“Where is the victory of this swamp? I refuse to feel its bite, for I am <span class="italic1">proud</span>. Proud to live in these days, proud to be part of what is to come. All the lives that came before us in this Age looked forward to our day, the day when men will be tested. Let others bemoan their fate. Let others cry and wail. We will not, for we will face this test with heads held high. And we will let it <span class="italic1">prove</span> us strong!”</p>
<p class="para">Not a long speech; he did not wish to extend their time in the swamp overly much. Still, it seemed to do its duty. The men’s backs straightened, and they nodded. Men who had been chosen to do so wrote down the words, and moved back to read them to those who had not been able to hear.</p>
<p class="para">When the troop continued forward, the men’s footsteps no longer dragged, their postures were no longer slumped. Galad remained on his hillside, taking a few reports, letting the men see him as they passed.</p>
<p class="para">When the last of the seven thousand had gone by, Galad noted a small group waiting at the base of the hill. Child Jaret Byar stood with them, looking up at Galad, sunken eyes alight with zeal. He was gaunt, with a narrow face.</p>
<p class="para">“Child Byar,” Galad said, walking down from the hillside.</p>
<p class="para">“It was a good speech, my Lord Captain Commander,” Byar said fervently. “The Last Battle. Yes, it <span class="italic1">is</span> time to go to it.”</p>
<p class="para">“It is our burden,” Galad said. “And our duty.”</p>
<p class="para">“We will ride northward,” Byar said. “Men will come to us, and we will grow. An enormous force of the Children, tens of thousands. <span class="italic1">Hundreds</span> of thousands. We will wash over the land. Maybe we will have enough men to cast down the White Tower and the witches, rather than needing to ally with them.”</p>
<p class="para">Galad shook his head. “We will need the Aes Sedai, Child Byar. The Shadow will have Dreadlords, Myrddraal, <span class="italic1">Forsaken</span>.”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, I suppose.” Byar seemed reluctant. Well, he’d seemed reluctant about the idea before, but he <span class="italic1">had</span> agreed to it.</p>
<p class="para">“Our road is difficult, Child Byar, but the Children of the Light will be leaders at the Last Battle.”</p>
<p class="para">Valda’s misdeeds had tarnished the entire order. More than that, Galad was increasingly convinced that Asunawa had played a large role in the mistreatment and death of his stepmother. That meant the High Inquisitor himself was corrupt.</p>
<p class="para">Doing what was right was the most important thing in life. It required any sacrifice. At this time, the right thing to do was flee. Galad could not face Asunawa; the High Inquisitor was backed by the Seanchan. Besides, the Last Battle was more important.</p>
<p class="para">Galad stepped swiftly, walking through the muck back toward the front of the line of Children. They traveled light, with few pack animals, and his men wore their armor—their mounts were laden with food and supplies.</p>
<p class="para">At the front, Galad found Trom speaking with a few men who wore leathers and brown cloaks, not white tabards and steel caps. Their scouts. Trom nodded to him in respect; the Lord Captain was one of Galad’s most trusted men. “Scouts say there’s a small issue ahead, my Lord Captain Commander,” Trom said.</p>
<p class="para">“What issue?”</p>
<p class="para">“It would be best to show it to you directly, sir,” said Child Barlett, the leader of the scouts.</p>
<p class="para">Galad nodded him forward. Ahead, the swampy forest seemed to be thinning. Thank the Light—did that mean they were nearly free?</p>
<p class="para">No. As Galad arrived, he found several other scouts looking out at a dead forest. Most trees in the swamp bore leaves, though sickly ones, but those ahead were skeletal and ashen, as if burned. There was some kind of sickly white lichen or moss growing over everything. The tree trunks looked emaciated.</p>
<p class="para">Water flooded this area, a wide but shallow river with a very slow current. It had swallowed the bases of many of the trees, and fallen tree limbs broke the dirty brown water like arms reaching toward the sky.</p>
<p class="para">“There are corpses, my Lord Captain Commander,” one of the scouts said, gesturing upriver. “Floating down. Looks like the remnants of a distant battle.”</p>
<p class="para">“Is this river on our maps?” Galad asked.</p>
<p class="para">One by one, the scouts shook their heads.</p>
<p class="para">Galad set his jaw. “Can this be forded?”</p>
<p class="para">“It’s shallow, my Lord Captain Commander,” Child Barlett said. “But we’ll have to watch for hidden depths.”</p>
<p class="para">Galad reached out to a tree beside him and broke free a long branch, the wood snapping loudly. “I will go first. Have the men remove their armor and cloaks.”</p>
<p class="para">The orders went down the line, and Galad took off his armor and wrapped it in his cloak, then tied it to his back. He hiked up his trousers as far as he could, then stepped down the gentle bank and plowed forward into the murky water. The sharply cold spring runoff made him tense. His boots sank inches into the sandy bottom, filling with water, stirring up swirls of mud. Stout made a louder splash as he stepped into the water behind.</p>
<p class="para">It wasn’t too difficult to walk in; the water only came up to his knees. He used his stick to find the best footing. Those skeletal, dying trees were unnerving. They didn’t seem to be rotting, and now that he was closer, he could better see the ash-gray fuzz among the lichen that coated their trunks and branches.</p>
<p class="para">The Children behind splashed loudly as more and more of them entered the wide stream. Nearby, bulbous forms floated down the river to catch upon rocks. Some were the corpses of men, but many were larger. <span class="italic1">Mules,</span> he realized, catching a better look at a snout. <span class="italic1">Dozens of them.</span> They’d been dead for some time, judging by the bloat.</p>
<p class="para">Likely a village upstream had been attacked for its food. This wasn’t the first group of dead they’d found.</p>
<p class="para">He reached the other side of the river, then climbed out. As he unrolled his trouser legs and donned his armor and cloak, he felt his shoulder aching from the blows Valda had given him. His thigh still stung, too.</p>
<p class="para">He turned and continued down the game trail northward, leading the way as other Children reached the bank. He longed to ride Stout, but he dared not. Though they were out of the river, the ground was still damp, uneven, and pocked with hidden sinkholes. If he rode, he could easily cost Stout a broken leg and himself a broken crown.</p>
<p class="para">So he and his men walked, surrounded by those gray trees, sweating in the miserable heat. He longed for a good bath.</p>
<p class="para">Eventually, Trom jogged up the line to him. “All men are across safely.” He checked the sky. “Burn those clouds. I can never tell what time it is.”</p>
<p class="para">“Four hours past midday,” Galad said.</p>
<p class="para">“You’re certain?”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="para">“Weren’t we to stop at midday to discuss our next step?” That meeting was to have taken place once they got through the swamp.</p>
<p class="para">“For now, we have few choices,” Galad said. “I will lead the men northward to Andor.”</p>
<p class="para">“The Children have met…hostility there.”</p>
<p class="para">“I have some secluded land up in the northwest. I will not be turned away there, regardless of who controls the throne.”</p>
<p class="para">Light send that Elayne held the Lion Throne. Light send that she had escaped the tangles of the Aes Sedai, though he feared the worst. There were many who would use her as a pawn, al’Thor not the least of them. She was headstrong, and that could make her easy to manipulate.</p>
<p class="para">“We’ll need supplies,” Trom said. “Forage is difficult, and more and more villages are empty.”</p>
<p class="para">Galad nodded. A legitimate concern.</p>
<p class="para">“It’s a good plan, though,” Trom said, then lowered his voice. “I’ll admit, Damodred, I worried that you’d refuse leadership.”</p>
<p class="para">“I could not. To abandon the Children now, after killing their leader, would be wrong.”</p>
<p class="para">Trom smiled. “It’s as simple as that to you, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="para">“It should be as simple as that to anyone.” Galad <span class="italic1">had</span> to rise to the station he had been given. He had no other option. “The Last Battle comes and the Children of the Light will fight. Even if we have to make alliances with the Dragon Reborn himself, we <span class="italic1">will</span> fight.”</p>
<p class="para">For some time, Galad hadn’t been certain about al’Thor. Certainly the Dragon Reborn would have to fight at the Last Battle. But was that man al’Thor, or was he a puppet of the Tower, and not the true Dragon Reborn? That sky was too dark, the land too broken. Al’Thor <span class="italic1">must</span> be the Dragon Reborn. That didn’t mean, of course, that he wasn’t also a puppet of the Aes Sedai.</p>
<p class="para">Soon they passed beyond the skeletal gray trees, reaching ones that were more ordinary. These still had yellowed leaves, too many dead branches. But that was better than the fuzz.</p>
<p class="para">About an hour later, Galad noted Child Barlett returning. The scout was a lean man, scarred on one cheek. Galad held up a hand as the man approached. “What word?”</p>
<p class="para">Barlett saluted with arm to chest. “The swamp dries out and the trees thin in about one mile, my Lord Captain Commander. The field beyond is open and empty, the way clear to the north.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Light be thanked!</span> Galad thought. He nodded to Barlett, and the man hurried back through the trees.</p>
<p class="para">Galad glanced back at the line of men. They were muddied, sweaty, and fatigued. But still, they were a grand sight, their armor replaced, their faces determined. They had followed him through this pit of a swamp. They were good men.</p>
<p class="para">“Pass the word to the other Lords Captain, Trom,” Galad said. “Have them send word to their legions. We’ll be out of this in under an hour.”</p>
<p class="para">The older man smiled, looking as relieved as Galad felt. Galad continued onward, jaw set against the pain of his leg. The cut was well bound, and there was little danger of further damage. It was painful, but pain could be dealt with.</p>
<p class="para">Finally free of this bog! He would need to plot their next course carefully, staying away from any towns, major roads, or estates held by influential lords. He ran through the maps in his head—maps memorized before his tenth nameday.</p>
<p class="para">He was thus engaged when the yellow canopy thinned, clouded sunlight peeking between branches. Soon he caught sight of Barlett waiting at the edge of the line of trees. The forest ended abruptly, almost as neat as a line on a map.</p>
<p class="para">Galad sighed in relief, relishing the thought of being out in the open again. He stepped from the trees. Only then did an enormous force of troops begin to appear, climbing over a rise directly to his right.</p>
<p class="para">Armor clanged, horses whinnying, as thousands of soldiers lined up atop the rise. Some were Children in their plate and mail, with conical helms shined to perfection. Their pristine tabards and cloaks shone, sunbursts glittering at the breasts, lances raised in ranks. The larger number were foot soldiers, not wearing the white of the Children, but instead simple brown leathers. Amadicians, likely provided by the Seanchan. Many had bows.</p>
<p class="para">Galad stumbled back, hand going to his sword. But he knew, immediately, that he had been trapped. Not a few of the Children wore clothing adorned with the crook of the Hand of the Light—the Questioners. If ordinary Children were a flame to burn away evil, the Questioners were a raging bonfire.</p>
<p class="para">Galad did a quick count. Three to four thousand Children and at least another six to eight thousand foot, half of those with bows. Ten thousand fresh troops. His heart sank.</p>
<p class="para">Trom, Bornhald and Byar hastened out of the forest behind Galad along with a group of other Children. Trom cursed softly.</p>
<p class="para">“So,” Galad said, turning to the scout, Barlett, “you are a traitor?”</p>
<p class="para">“You are the traitor, Child Damodred,” the scout replied, face hard.</p>
<p class="para">“Yes,” Galad said, “I suppose it could be perceived that way.” This march through the swamp had been suggested by his scouts. Galad could see now; it had been a delaying tactic, a way for Asunawa to get ahead of Galad. The march had also left Galad’s men tired while Asunawa’s force was fresh and ready for battle.</p>
<p class="para">A sword scraped in its sheath.</p>
<p class="para">Galad immediately raised a hand without turning. “Peace, Child Byar.” Byar would have been the one to reach for his weapon, probably to strike down Barlett.</p>
<p class="para">Perhaps something of this could be salvaged. Galad made his decision swiftly. “Child Byar and Child Bornhald, you are with me. Trom, you and the other Lords Captain bring our men out in ranks onto the field.”</p>
<p class="para">A large cluster of men near the front of Asunawa’s force was riding forward, down the hillside. Many wore the crook of the Questioners. They could have sprung their ambush and killed Galad’s group quickly. Instead, they sent down a group to parley. That was a good sign.</p>
<p class="para">Galad mounted, suppressing a wince for his wounded leg. Byar and Bornhald mounted as well, and they followed him onto the field, hoofbeats muffled by the thick, yellowed grass. Asunawa himself was among the group approaching. He had thick, graying eyebrows and was so thin as to appear a doll made of sticks, with fabric stretched across them to imitate skin.</p>
<p class="para">Asunawa was not smiling. He rarely did.</p>
<p class="para">Galad pulled his horse up before the High Inquisitor. Asunawa was surrounded by a small guard of his Questioners, but was also accompanied by five Lords Captain, each of whom Galad had met with—or served under—during his short time in the Children.</p>
<p class="para">Asunawa leaned forward in his saddle, sunken eyes narrowing. “Your rebels form ranks. Tell them to stand down or my archers will loose.”</p>
<p class="para">“Surely you would not ignore the rules of formal engagement?” Galad said. “You would draw arrows upon men as they form ranks? Where is your honor?”</p>
<p class="para">“Darkfriends deserve no honor,” Asunawa snapped. “Nor do they deserve pity.”</p>
<p class="para">“You name us Darkfriends then?” Galad asked, turning his mount slightly. “All seven thousand Children who were under Valda’s command? Men your soldiers have served with, eaten with, known and fought beside? Men you yourself watched over not two months ago?”</p>
<p class="para">Asunawa hesitated. Naming seven thousand of the Children as Darkfriends would be ridiculous—it would mean that two out of three remaining Children had gone to the Shadow.</p>
<p class="para">“No,” Asunawa said. “Perhaps they are simply…misguided. Even a good man can stray down shadowed paths if his leaders are Darkfriends.”</p>
<p class="para">“I am no Darkfriend.” Galad met Asunawa’s eyes.</p>
<p class="para">“Submit to my questioning and prove it.”</p>
<p class="para">“The Lord Captain Commander submits himself to no one,” Galad said. “Under the Light, I order <span class="italic1">you</span> to stand down.”</p>
<p class="para">Asunawa laughed. “Child, we hold a knife to your throat! This is <span class="italic1">your</span> chance to surrender!”</p>
<p class="para">“Golever,” Galad said, looking at the Lord Captain at Asunawa’s left. Golever was a lanky, bearded man, as hard as they came—but he was also fair. “Tell me, do the Children of the Light surrender?”</p>
<p class="para">Golever shook his head. “We do not. The Light will prove us victorious.”</p>
<p class="para">“And if we face superior odds?” Galad asked.</p>
<p class="para">“We fight on.”</p>
<p class="para">“If we are tired and sore?”</p>
<p class="para">“The Light will protect us,” Golever said. “And if it is our time to die, then so be it. Let us take as many enemies with us as we may.”</p>
<p class="para">Galad turned back to Asunawa. “You see that I am in a predicament. To fight is to let you name us Darkfriends, but to surrender is to deny our oaths. By my honor as the Lord Captain Commander, I can accept neither option.”</p>
<p class="para">Asunawa’s expression darkened. “You are <span class="italic1">not</span> the Lord Captain Commander. He is dead.”</p>
<p class="para">“By my hand,” Galad said, unsheathing his weapon, holding it forward so that the herons gleamed in the light. “And I hold his sword. Do you deny that you yourself watched me face Valda in fair combat, as prescribed by law?”</p>
<p class="para">“As by the law, perhaps,” Asunawa said. “But I would not call that fight fair. You drew on the powers of Shadow; I saw you standing in darkness despite the daylight, and I saw the Dragon’s Fang sprout on your forehead. Valda never had a chance.”</p>
<p class="para">“Harnesh,” Galad said, turning to the Lord Captain to the right of Asunawa. He was a short man, bald, missing one ear from fighting Dragonsworn. “Tell me. Is the Shadow stronger than the Light?”</p>
<p class="para">“Of course not,” the man said, spitting to the side.</p>
<p class="para">“If the Lord Captain Commander’s cause had been honorable, would he have fallen to me in a battle under the Light? If I were a Darkfriend, could I have slain the Lord Captain Commander himself?”</p>
<p class="para">Harnesh didn’t answer, but Galad could almost see the thoughts in his head. The Shadow might display strength at times, but the Light always revealed and destroyed it. It was possible for the Lord Captain Commander to fall to a Darkfriend—it was possible for any man to fall. But in a duel before the other Children? A duel for honor, under the Light?</p>
<p class="para">“Sometimes the Shadow displays cunning and strength,” Asunawa cut in before Galad could continue to question. “At times, good men die.”</p>
<p class="para">“You all know what Valda did,” Galad said. “My mother is dead. Is there an argument against my right to challenge him?”</p>
<p class="para">“You have no rights as a Darkfriend! I will parley no more with you, murderer.” Asunawa waved a hand, and several of his Questioners drew swords. Immediately, Galad’s companions did the same. Behind, he could hear his weary forces hastily closing their ranks.</p>
<p class="para">“What will happen to us, Asunawa, if Child fights Child?” Galad asked softly. “I will not surrender, and I would not attack you, but perhaps we can reunite. Not as enemies, but as brothers separated for a time.”</p>
<p class="para">“I will never associate with Darkfriends,” Asunawa said, though he sounded hesitant. He watched Galad’s men. Asunawa would win a battle, but if Galad’s men stood their ground, it would be a costly victory. Both sides would lose thousands.</p>
<p class="para">“I will submit to you,” Galad said. “On certain terms.”</p>
<p class="para">“No!” Bornhald said from behind, but Galad raised a hand, silencing him.</p>
<p class="para">“What terms would those be?” Asunawa asked.</p>
<p class="para">“You swear—before the Light and the Lords Captain here with you—that you will not harm, question, or otherwise condemn the men who followed me. They were only doing what they thought was right.”</p>
<p class="para">Asunawa’s eyes narrowed, his lips forming a straight line.</p>
<p class="para">“That includes my companions here,” Galad said, nodding to Byar and Bornhald. “Every man, Asunawa. They must <span class="italic1">never</span> know questioning.”</p>
<p class="para">“You cannot hinder the Hand of the Light in such a way! This would give them free rein to seek the Shadow!”</p>
<p class="para">“And is it only fear of Questioning that keeps us in the Light, Asunawa?” Galad asked. “Are not the Children valiant and true?”</p>
<p class="para">Asunawa fell silent. Galad closed his eyes, feeling the weight of leadership. Each moment he stalled increased the bargaining position for his men. He opened his eyes. “The Last Battle comes, Asunawa. We haven’t time for squabbling. The Dragon Reborn walks the land.”</p>
<p class="para">“Heresy!” Asunawa said.</p>
<p class="para">“Yes,” Galad said. “And truth as well.”</p>
<p class="para">Asunawa ground his teeth, but seemed to be considering the offer.</p>
<p class="para">“Galad,” Bornhald said softly. “Don’t do this. We can fight. The Light will protect us!”</p>
<p class="para">“If we fight, we will kill good men, Child Bornhald,” Galad said, without turning. “Each stroke of our swords will be a blow for the Dark One. The Children are the only true foundation that this world has left. We are needed. If my life is what is demanded to bring unity, then so be it. You would do the same, I believe.” He met Asunawa’s eyes.</p>
<p class="para">“Take him,” Asunawa snapped, looking dissatisfied. “And tell the legions to stand down. Inform them that I have taken the false Lord Captain Commander into custody, and will Question him to determine the extent of his crimes.” He hesitated. “But also pass the word that those who followed him are not to be punished or Questioned.” Asunawa spun his horse and rode away.</p>
<p class="para">Galad turned his sword and handed it out to Bornhald. “Return to our men; tell them what happened here, and do <span class="italic1">not</span> let them fight or try to rescue me. That is an order.”</p>
<p class="para">Bornhald met his eyes, then slowly took the sword. At last, he saluted. “Yes, my Lord Captain Commander.”</p>
<p class="para">As soon as they turned to ride away, rough hands grabbed Galad and pulled him from Stout’s saddle. He hit the ground with a grunt, his bad shoulder throwing a spike of agony across his chest. He tried to climb to his feet, but several Questioners dismounted and knocked him down again.</p>
<p class="para">One forced Galad to the ground, a boot on his back, and Galad heard the metallic rasp of a knife being unsheathed. They cut his armor and clothing free.</p>
<p class="para">“You will not wear the uniform of a Child of the Light, Darkfriend,” a Questioner said in his ear.</p>
<p class="para">“I am <span class="italic1">not</span> a Darkfriend,” Galad said, face pressed to the grassy earth. “I will never speak that lie. I walk in the Light.”</p>
<p class="para">That earned him a kick to the side, then another, and another. He curled up, grunting. But the blows continued to fall.</p>
<p class="para">Finally, the darkness took him.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">The creature that had once been Padan Fain walked down the side of a hill. The brown weeds grew in broken patches, like the scrub on the chin of a beggar.</p>
<p class="para">The sky was black. A tempest. He liked that, though he hated the one who caused it.</p>
<p class="para">Hatred. It was the proof that he still lived, the one emotion left. The only emotion. It was all that there could be.</p>
<p class="para">Consuming. Thrilling. Beautiful. Warming. Violent. Hatred. Wonderful. It was the storm that gave him strength, the purpose that drove him. Al’Thor would die. By his hand. And perhaps after that, the Dark One. Wonderful…</p>
<p class="para">The creature that had been Padan Fain fingered his beautiful dagger, feeling the ridges of the designs in the fine golden wire that wrapped its hilt. A large ruby capped the end of its hilt, and he carried the weapon unsheathed in his right hand so that the blade extended between his first two fingers. The sides of those fingers had been cut a dozen times over.</p>
<p class="para">Blood dripped from the tip of the dagger down onto the weeds. Crimson spots to cheer him. Red below, black above. Perfect. Did his hatred cause that storm? It must be so. Yes.</p>
<p class="para">The drops of blood fell alongside spots of darkness that appeared on dead leaves and stems as he moved farther north into the Blight.</p>
<p class="para">He was mad. That was good. When you accepted madness into yourself—embraced it and drank it in as if it were sunlight or water or the air itself—it became another part of you. Like a hand or an eye. You could see by madness. You could hold things with madness. It was wonderful. Liberating.</p>
<p class="para">He was finally free.</p>
<p class="para">The creature that had been Mordeth reached the bottom of the hill and did not look back at the large, purplish mass that he’d left atop it. Worms were very messy to kill the right way, but some things needed to be done the right way. It was the principle of the thing.</p>
<p class="para">Mist had begun to trail him, creeping up from the ground. Was that mist his madness, or was it his hatred? It was so familiar. It twisted around his ankles and licked at his heels.</p>
<p class="para">Something peeked around a hillside nearby, then ducked back. Worms died loudly. Worms did <span class="italic1">everything</span> loudly. A pack of Worms could destroy an entire legion. When you heard them, you went the other way, quickly. But then, it could be advantageous to send scouts to go judge the direction of the pack, lest you continue on and run across it again elsewhere.</p>
<p class="para">So the creature that had been Padan Fain was not surprised when he rounded the hillside and found a nervous group of Trollocs there, a Myrddraal guiding them.</p>
<p class="para">He smiled. <span class="italic1">My friends.</span> It had been too long.</p>
<p class="para">It took a moment for their brutish brains to come to the obvious—but false—conclusion: If a man was wandering around, then Worms <span class="italic1">couldn’t</span> be near. Those would have smelled his blood and come for him. Worms preferred humans over Trollocs. That made sense. The creature that had been Mordeth had tasted both, and Trolloc flesh had little to recommend it.</p>
<p class="para">The Trollocs tore forward in a mismatched pack, feathers, beaks, claws, teeth, tusks. The creature that had been Fain stood still, mist licking his unshod feet. How wonderful! At the very back of the group, the Myrddraal hesitated, its eyeless gaze fixed on him. Perhaps it sensed that something was terribly, terribly wrong. And right, of course. You couldn’t be one without the other. That wouldn’t make sense.</p>
<p class="para">The creature that had been Mordeth—he would need a new name soon—smiled deeply.</p>
<p class="para">The Myrddraal turned to run away.</p>
<p class="para">The mist struck.</p>
<p class="para">It rolled over the Trollocs, moving quickly, like the tentacles of a leviathan in the Aryth Ocean. Lengths of it snapped forward through Trolloc chests. One long rope whipped above their heads, then shot forward in a blur, taking the Fade in the neck.</p>
<p class="para">The Trollocs screamed, dropping, spasming. Their hair fell out in patches, and their skin began to <span class="italic1">boil</span>. Blisters and cysts. When those popped, they left craterlike pocks in the Shadowspawn skin, like bubbles on the surface of metal that cooled too quickly.</p>
<p class="para">The creature that had been Padan Fain opened his mouth in glee, closing his eyes to the tumultuous black sky and raising his face, lips parted, enjoying his feast. After it passed, he sighed, holding his dagger tighter—cutting his flesh.</p>
<p class="para">Red below, black above. Red and black, red and black, so much red and black. Wonderful.</p>
<p class="para">He walked on through the Blight.</p>
<p class="para">The corrupted Trollocs climbed to their feet behind him, lurching into motion, spittle dropping from their lips. Their eyes had grown sluggish and dull, but when he desired it, they would respond with a frenzied battle lust that would surpass what they had known in life.</p>
<p class="para">He left the Myrddraal. It would not rise, as rumors said they did. His touch now brought instant death to one of its kind. Pity. He had a few nails he might have otherwise put to good use.</p>
<p class="para">Perhaps he should get some gloves. But if he did, he couldn’t cut his hand. What a problem.</p>
<p class="para">No matter. Onward. The time had come to kill al’Thor.</p>
<p class="para">It saddened him that the hunt must end. But there was no longer a reason for a hunt. You didn’t hunt something when you knew <span class="italic1">exactly</span> where it was going to be. You merely showed up to meet it.</p>
<p class="para">Like an old friend. A dear, beloved old friend that you were going to stab through the eye, open up at the gut and consume by handfuls while drinking his blood. That was the proper way to treat friends.</p>
<p class="para">It was an honor.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Malenarin Rai shuffled through supply reports. That blasted shutter on the window behind his desk snapped and blew open again, letting in the damp heat of the Blight.</p>
<p class="para">Despite ten years serving as commander of Heeth Tower, he hadn’t grown accustomed to the heat in the highlands. Damp. Muggy, the air often full of rotting scents.</p>
<p class="para">The whistling wind rattled the wooden shutter. He rose, walking over to pull it shut, then twisted a bit of twine around its handle to keep it closed.</p>
<p class="para">He walked back to his desk, looking over the roster of newly arrived soldiers. Each name had a specialty beside it—up here, every soldier had to fill two or more duties. Skill at binding wounds. Swift feet for running messages. A keen eye with a bow. The ability to make the same old mush taste like new mush. Malenarin always asked specifically for men in the last group. Any cook who could make soldiers eager to come to mess was worth his weight in gold.</p>
<p class="para">Malenarin set aside his current report, weighing it down with the lead-filled Trolloc horn he kept for the purpose. The next sheet in his stack was a letter from a man named Barriga, a merchant who was bringing his caravan to the tower to trade. Malenarin smiled; he was a soldier first, but he wore the three silver chains across his chest that marked him as a master merchant. While his tower received many of its supplies directly from the Queen, no Kandori commander was denied the opportunity to barter with merchants.</p>
<p class="para">If he was lucky, he’d be able to get this outlander merchant drunk at the bargaining table. Malenarin had forced more than one merchant into a year of military service as penance for entering bargains he could not keep. A year of training with the Queen’s forces often did plump foreign merchants a great deal of good.</p>
<p class="para">He set that sheet beneath the Trolloc horn, then hesitated as he saw the last item for his attention at the bottom of the stack. It was a reminder from his steward. Keemlin, his eldest son, was approaching his fourteenth nameday. As if Malenarin could forget about that! He needed no reminder.</p>
<p class="para">He smiled, setting the Trolloc horn on the note, in case that shutter broke open again. He’d slain the Trolloc who had borne that horn himself. Then he walked over to the side of his office and opened his battered oak trunk. Among the other effects inside was a cloth-wrapped sword, the brown scabbard kept well oiled and maintained, but faded with time. His father’s sword.</p>
<p class="para">In three days, he would give it to Keemlin. A boy became a man on his fourteenth nameday, the day he was given his first sword and became responsible for himself. Keemlin had worked hard to learn his forms under the harshest trainers Malenarin could provide. Soon his son would become a man. How quickly the years passed.</p>
<p class="para">Taking a proud breath, Malenarin closed the trunk, then rose and left his office for his daily rounds. The tower housed two hundred and fifty soldiers, a bastion of defense that watched the Blight.</p>
<p class="para">To have a duty was to have pride—just as to bear a burden was to gain strength. Watching the Blight was his duty and his strength, and it was particularly important these days, with the strange storm to the north, and with the Queen and much of the Kandori army having marched to seek the Dragon Reborn. He pulled the door to his office closed, then threw the hidden latch that barred it on the other side. It was one of several such doors in the hallway; an enemy storming the tower wouldn’t know which one opened onto the stairwell upward. In this way, a small office could function as part of the tower defense.</p>
<p class="para">He walked to the stairwell. These top levels were not accessible from the ground level—the entire bottom forty feet of the tower was a trap. An enemy who entered at the ground floor and climbed up three flights of garrison quarters would discover no way up to the fourth floor. The only way to go to the fourth level was to climb a narrow, collapsible ramp on the outside of the tower that led from the second level up to the fourth. Running on it left attackers fully exposed to arrows from above. Then, once some of them were up but others not, the Kandori would collapse the ramp, dividing the enemy force and leaving those above to be killed as they tried to find the interior stairwells.</p>
<p class="para">Malenarin climbed at a brisk pace. Periodic slits to the sides of the steps looked down on the stairs beneath, and would allow archers to fire on invaders. When he was about halfway to the top, he heard hasty footfalls coming down. A second later, Jargen—sergeant of the watch—rounded the bend. Like most Kandori, Jargen wore a forked beard; his black hair was dusted with gray.</p>
<p class="para">Jargen had joined the Blightwatch the day after his fourteenth nameday. He wore a cord looped around the shoulder of his brown uniform; it bore a knot for each Trolloc he’d killed. There had to be approaching fifty knots in the thing by now.</p>
<p class="para">Jargen saluted with arm to breast, then lowered his hand to rest on his sword, a sign of respect for his commander. In many countries, holding the weapon like that would be an insult, but Southerners were known to be peevish and ill-tempered. Couldn’t they see that it was an honor to hold your sword and imply you found your commander a worthy threat?</p>
<p class="para">“My Lord,” Jargen said, voice gruff. “A flash from Rena Tower.”</p>
<p class="para">“What?” Malenarin asked. The two fell into step, trotting up the stairwell.</p>
<p class="para">“It was distinct, sir,” Jargen said. “Saw it myself, I did. Only a flash, but it <span class="italic1">was</span> there.”</p>
<p class="para">“Did they send a correction?”</p>
<p class="para">“They may have by now. I ran to fetch you first.”</p>
<p class="para">If there had been more news, Jargen would have shared it, so Malenarin did not waste breath pressing him. Shortly, they stepped up onto the top of the tower, which held an enormous mechanism of mirrors and lamps. With the apparatus, the tower could send messages to the east or west—where other towers lined the Blight—or southward, along a line of towers that ran to the Aesdaishar Palace in Chachin.</p>
<p class="para">The vast, undulating Kandori highlands spread out from his tower. Some of the southern hills were still lightly laced with morning fog. That land to the south, free of this unnatural heat, would soon grow green, and Kandori herdsmen would climb to the high pastures to graze their sheep.</p>
<p class="para">Northward lay the Blight. Malenarin had read of days when the Blight had barely been visible from this tower. Now it ran nearly to the base of the stonework. Rena Tower was northwest as well. Its commander—Lord Niach of House Okatomo—was a distant cousin and a good friend. He would not have sent a flash without reason, and would send a retraction if it had been an accident.</p>
<p class="para">“Any further word?” Malenarin asked.</p>
<p class="para">The soldiers on watch shook their heads. Jargen tapped his foot, and Malenarin folded his arms to wait for a correction.</p>
<p class="para">Nothing came. Rena Tower stood within the Blight these days, as it was farther north than Heeth Tower. Its position within the Blight was normally not an issue. Even the most fearsome creatures of the Blight knew not to attack a Kandori tower.</p>
<p class="para">No correction came. Not a glimmer. “Send a message to Rena,” Malenarin said. “Ask if their flash was a mistake. Then ask Farmay Tower if they have noticed anything strange.”</p>
<p class="para">Jargen set the men to work, but gave Malenarin a flat glance, as if to ask, “You think I haven’t done that already?”</p>
<p class="para">That meant messages had been sent, but there was no word back. Wind blew across the tower top, creaking the steel of the mirror apparatus as his men sent another series of flashes. That wind was humid. Far too hot. Malenarin glanced upward, toward where that same black storm boiled and rolled. It seemed to have settled down.</p>
<p class="para">That struck him as very discomforting.</p>
<p class="para">“Flash a message backward,” Malenarin said, “toward the inland towers. Tell them what we saw; tell them to be ready in case of trouble.”</p>
<p class="para">The men set to work.</p>
<p class="para">“Sergeant,” Malenarin said, “who is next on the messenger roster?”</p>
<p class="para">The tower force included a small group of boys who were excellent riders. Lightweight, they could go on fast horses should a commander decide to bypass the mirrors. Mirror light was fast, but it could be seen by one’s enemies. Besides, if the line of towers was broken—or if the apparatus was damaged—they would need a means to get word to the capital.</p>
<p class="para">“Next on the roster…” Jargen said, checking a list nailed to the inside of the door onto the rooftop. “It would be Keemlin, my Lord.”</p>
<p class="para">Keemlin. His Keemlin.</p>
<p class="para">Malenarin glanced to the northwest, toward the silent tower that had flashed so ominously. “Bring me word if there is a <span class="italic1">hint</span> of response from the other towers,” Malenarin said to the soldiers. “Jargen, come with me.”</p>
<p class="para">The two of them hurried down the stairs. “We need to send a messenger southward,” Malenarin said, then hesitated. “No. No, we need to send several messengers. Double up. Just in case the towers fall.” He began moving again.</p>
<p class="para">The two of them left the stairwell and entered Malenarin’s office. He grabbed his best quill off the rack on his wall. That blasted shutter was blowing and rattling again; the papers on his desk rustled as he pulled out a fresh sheet of paper.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Rena and Farmay not responding to flash messages. Possibly overrun or severely hampered. Be advised. Heeth will stand.</span></p>
<p class="para">He folded the paper, holding it up to Jargen. The man took it with a leathery hand, read it over, then grunted. “Two copies, then?”</p>
<p class="para">“Three,” Malenarin said. “Mobilize the archers and send them to the roof. Tell them danger may come from above.”</p>
<p class="para">If he wasn’t merely jumping at shadows—if the towers to either side of Heeth had fallen so quickly—then so could those to the south. And if <span class="italic1">he’d</span> been the one making an assault, he’d have done anything he could to sneak around and take out one of the southern towers first. That was the best way to make sure no messages got back to the capital.</p>
<p class="para">Jargen saluted, fist to chest, then withdrew. The message would be sent immediately: three times on legs of horseflesh, once on legs of light. Malenarin let himself feel a hint of relief that his son was one of those riding to safety. There was no dishonor in that; the messages needed to be delivered, and Keemlin was next on the roster.</p>
<p class="para">Malenarin glanced out his window. It faced north, toward the Blight. Every commander’s office did that. The bubbling storm, with its silvery clouds. Sometimes they looked like straight geometric shapes. He had listened well to passing merchants. Troubled times were coming. The Queen would not have gone south to seek a false Dragon, no matter how cunning or influential he might be. She believed.</p>
<p class="para">It was time for Tarmon Gai’don. And looking out into that storm, Malenarin thought he could see to the very edge of time itself. An edge that was not far distant. In fact, it seemed to be growing darker. And there was a darkness beneath it, on the ground northward.</p>
<p class="para">That darkness was advancing.</p>
<p class="para">Malenarin dashed out of the room, racing up the steps to the roof, where the wind swept against men pushing and moving mirrors.</p>
<p class="para">“Was the message sent to the south?” he demanded.</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, sir,” Lieutenant Landalin said. He’d been roused to take command of the tower’s top. “No reply yet.”</p>
<p class="para">Malenarin glanced down, and picked out three riders breaking away from the tower at full speed. The messengers were off. They would stop at Barklan if it wasn’t being attacked. The captain there would send them on southward, just in case. And if Barklan didn’t stand, the boys would continue on, all the way to the capital if needed.</p>
<p class="para">Malenarin turned back to the storm. That advancing darkness had him on edge. It was coming.</p>
<p class="para">“Raise the hoardings,” he ordered Landalin. “Bring up the store hitchings and empty the cellars. Have the loaders gather all of the arrows and set up stations for resupplying the archers, and put archers at every choke point, kill slit and window. Start the firepots and have men ready to drop the outer ramps. Prepare for a siege.”</p>
<p class="para">As Landalin barked orders, men rushed away. Malenarin heard boots scrape stone behind him, and he glanced over his shoulder. Was that Jargen back again?</p>
<p class="para">No. It was a youth of nearly fourteen summers, too young for a beard, his dark hair disheveled, his face streaming with sweat caused—presumably—by a run up seven levels of the tower.</p>
<p class="para">Keemlin. Malenarin felt a stab of fear, instantly replaced with anger. “Soldier! You were to ride with a message!”</p>
<p class="para">Keemlin bit his lip. “Well, sir,” he said. “Tian, four places down from me. He is five, maybe ten pounds lighter than I. It makes a big difference, sir. He rides a lot faster, and I figured this would be an important message. So I asked for him to be sent in my place.”</p>
<p class="para">Malenarin frowned. Soldiers moved around them, rushing down the stairs or gathering with bows at the rim of the tower. The wind howled outside and thunder began to sound softly—yet insistently.</p>
<p class="para">Keemlin met his eyes. “Tian’s mother, Lady Yabeth, has lost four sons to the Blight,” he said, softly enough that only Malenarin could hear. “Tian’s the only one she has left. If one of us has a shot at getting out, sir, I figured it should be him.”</p>
<p class="para">Malenarin held his son’s eyes. The boy understood what was coming. Light help him, but he understood. And he’d sent another away in his place.</p>
<p class="para">“Kralle,” Malenarin barked, glancing toward one of the soldiers passing by.</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, my Lord Commander?”</p>
<p class="para">“Run down to my office,” Malenarin said. “There is a sword in my oaken trunk. Fetch it for me.”</p>
<p class="para">The man saluted, obeying.</p>
<p class="para">“Father?” Keemlin said. “My nameday isn’t for three days.”</p>
<p class="para">Malenarin waited with arms behind his back. His most important task at the moment was to be seen in command, to reassure his troops. Kralle returned with the sword; its worn scabbard bore the image of the oak set aflame. The symbol of House Rai.</p>
<p class="para">“Father….” Keemlin repeated. “I—”</p>
<p class="para">“This weapon is offered to a boy when he becomes a man,” Malenarin said. “It seems it is too late in coming, son. For I see a man standing before me.” He held the weapon forward in his right hand. Around the tower top, soldiers turned toward him: the archers with bows ready, the soldiers who operated the mirrors, the duty watchmen. As Borderlanders, each and every one of them would have been given his sword on his fourteenth nameday. Each one had felt the catch in the chest, the wonderful feeling of coming of age. It had happened to each of them, but that did not make this occasion any less special.</p>
<p class="para">Keemlin went down on one knee.</p>
<p class="para">“Why do you draw your sword?” Malenarin asked, voice loud so that every man atop the tower would hear.</p>
<p class="para">“In defense of my honor, my family, or my homeland,” Keemlin replied.</p>
<p class="para">“How long do you fight?”</p>
<p class="para">“Until my last breath joins the northern winds.”</p>
<p class="para">“When do you stop watching?”</p>
<p class="para">“Never,” Keemlin whispered.</p>
<p class="para">“Speak it louder!”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">“Never!”</span></p>
<p class="para">“Once this sword is drawn, you become a warrior, always with it near you in preparation to fight the Shadow. Will you draw this blade and join us, as a man?”</p>
<p class="para">Keemlin looked up, then took the hilt in a firm grip and pulled the weapon free.</p>
<p class="para">“Rise as a man, my son!” Malenarin declared.</p>
<p class="para">Keemlin stood, holding the weapon aloft, the bright blade reflecting the diffuse sunlight. The men atop the tower cheered.</p>
<p class="para">It was no shame to find tears in one’s eyes at such a moment. Malenarin blinked them free, then knelt down, buckling the sword belt at his son’s waist. The men continued to cheer and yell, and he knew it was not only for his son. They yelled in defiance of the Shadow. For a moment, their voices rang louder than the thunder.</p>
<p class="para">Malenarin stood, laying a hand on his son’s shoulder as the boy slid his sword into its sheath. Together they turned to face the oncoming Shadow.</p>
<p class="para">“There!” one of the archers said, pointing upward. “There’s something in the clouds!”</p>
<p class="para">“Draghkar!” another one said.</p>
<p class="para">The unnatural clouds were close now, and the shade they cast could no longer hide the undulating horde of Trollocs beneath. Something flew out from the sky, but a dozen of his archers let loose. The creature screamed and fell, dark wings flapping awkwardly.</p>
<p class="para">Jargen pushed his way through to Malenarin. “My Lord,” Jargen said, shooting a glance at Keemlin, “the boy should be below.”</p>
<p class="para">“Not a boy any longer,” Malenarin said with pride. “A man. What is your report?”</p>
<p class="para">“All is prepared.” Jargen glanced over the wall, eyeing the oncoming Trollocs as evenly as if he were inspecting a stable of horses. “They will not find this tree an easy one to fell.”</p>
<p class="para">Malenarin nodded. Keemlin’s shoulder was tense. That sea of Trollocs seemed endless. Against this foe, the tower would eventually fall. The Trollocs would keep coming, wave after wave.</p>
<p class="para">But every man atop that tower knew his duty. They’d kill Shadowspawn as long as they could, hoping to buy enough time for the messages to do some good.</p>
<p class="para">Malenarin was a man of the Borderlands, same as his father, same as his son beside him. They knew their task. You held until you were relieved.</p>
<p class="para">That’s all there was to it.</p>
