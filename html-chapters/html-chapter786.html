<p class="ct"><span class="epub-i">Unchangeable Things</span></p>
<p class="tni">Something was wrong with Rand.</p>
<p class="tx">Nynaeve clutched the stalagmite deep within the Pit of Doom, holding herself from being pulled by the winds into that nothingness in front of her. Moiraine had called it the Dark One’s essence, but wouldn’t that make it the True Power? Worse, if his essence was in the world, wouldn’t that mean that he had broken free? Whatever it was, its nature was pure evil, and it filled Nynaeve with a terror like none she had ever felt before in her life.</p>
<p class="tx">It pulled with a powerful force, drawing all that was nearby into it. She feared that if she let go, she would be yanked in. Already, it had stolen her shawl, making it vanish. If that nothingness pulled her in, her life would end. Perhaps her soul as well.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Rand!</span> Nynaeve thought. Could she do something to help him? He stood before Moridin, the two of them locked together, sword against sword. Frozen as if in a moment. Sweat trickled down Rand’s face. He did not speak. He didn’t so much as blink.</p>
<p class="tx">His foot had touched the darkness. At that moment, he had frozen, and so had Moridin. They were like statues. The air howled around them, but did not seem to affect them as it did Nynaeve. They’d been standing like that, frozen, for a good fifteen minutes.</p>
<p class="tx">All in all, it had been less than an hour since the group of them had entered the pit to face the Dark One.</p>
<p class="tx">Nynaeve watched rocks slide across the ground, then be sucked into that blackness. Her clothing rippled and flapped as if in a strong wind, as did Moiraine’s, who huddled nearby holding to her own tooth of stone. Mercifully, the stench of sulfur that had filled the cavern was drawn away here into the blackness.</p>
<p class="tx">She couldn’t use the One Power. Rand drew every bit of it she could hold, though he didn’t seem to be doing anything with it. Could she reach Moridin? He didn’t seem to be able to move. What if she took a rock to his head? It would be better than waiting.</p>
<p class="tx">Nynaeve tested her weight against the pull of the nothingness ahead, relaxing her grip on the stalagmite. She immediately started to slip, and pulled herself back.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">I am</span> not <span class="epub-i1">spending the Last Battle clinging to a rock!</span> she thought. <span class="epub-i1">Not the same one the whole time, at the very least.</span> She had to risk moving. Going directly forward seemed too dangerous, but if she moved sideways … yes, there was another stalagmite nearby to her right. She managed to let go of her hold and half-slip, half-scuttle to the next stalagmite. From there, she picked out another one, carefully eased off her hold and grabbed it instead.</p>
<p class="tx">The process was very slow. <span class="epub-i1">Rand, you wool-headed fool,</span> she thought. If he’d let her or Moiraine lead the circle, then maybe they could have done something while he was fighting!</p>
<p class="tx">She reached another stalagmite, then stopped as she saw something to her right. She almost screamed. A <span class="epub-i1">woman</span> huddled there, hidden against the wall, sheltered from the wind by the rocks. She appeared to be crying.</p>
<p class="tx">Nynaeve glanced at Rand, who was still locked in stasis with Moridin, then approached the woman. The greater number of stalagmites here meant that Nynaeve could crawl more safely, the stones blocking the pull of the nothingness.</p>
<p class="tx">Nynaeve reached the woman. She was chained to the wall. “Alanna?” Nynaeve shouted over the wind. “Light, what are you doing here?”</p>
<p class="tx">The Aes Sedai blinked reddened eyes at Nynaeve. Her eyes stared dully, as if she had no mind. As Nynaeve examined the woman, she noticed that the entire left side of Alanna’s body was bloodied from a knife wound to the gut. Light! Nynaeve should have known that from the paleness of the woman’s face.</p>
<p class="tx">Why stab her and leave her here? <span class="epub-i1">She bonded Rand,</span> Nynaeve realized. <span class="epub-i1">Oh, Light.</span> It was a trap. Moridin had left Alanna bleeding, then confronted Rand. When Alanna died, Rand—as her Warder—would be driven mad with rage, making him easy for Moridin to destroy.</p>
<p class="tx">Why hadn’t he noticed? Nynaeve fished at her pouches for herbs, then stopped short. Could herbs do anything at this point? She needed to use the One Power to Heal such a wound. Nynaeve ripped the woman’s clothing, making a bandage, then tried to draw <span class="epub-i1">saidar</span> for Healing.</p>
<p class="tx">Rand had it, and he wouldn’t let go. Frantic, she tried to batter him away, but Rand held tight. Tighter, as she tried to push against him. He <span class="epub-i1">did</span> seem to be channeling it, somehow, but she couldn’t see the weaves. She could feel something, but with the howling wind and the strange nature of the pit, it was like a tempest swirling around her. The Power was wrapped up in that somehow.</p>
<p class="tx">Blast it! She needed <span class="epub-i1">saidar</span>! It wasn’t Rand’s fault. He could not give her any power while leading the circle.</p>
<p class="tx">Nynaeve pressed her hand against Alanna’s wound, feeling helpless. Dared she call for Rand to release her from the circle? If she did, Moridin would undoubtedly turn on her and attack Alanna.</p>
<p class="tx">What to do? If this woman died, Rand would lose control. That, likely, would be the end of him … and of the Last Battle.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Mat hacked at the wood with his axe to sharpen it to a point. “See,” he said, “it doesn’t need to be fancy. Save your pretty carpentry to impress the mayor’s daughter.”</p>
<p class="tx">The watching men and women nodded with grim determination. They were farmers, villagers and craftsmen, like people he’d known back in the Two Rivers. Mat had thousands of them under his command. He’d never have suspected that there would be so many. The good people of the land had come to fight.</p>
<p class="tx">Mat figured they were insane, to a person. If he had been able to escape, he would be hiding in a basement somewhere. Burn him, but he would have tried.</p>
<p class="tx">Those dice rattled in his head, just as they’d been doing ever since Egwene gave him control of all of the armies of the Light. Being bloody <span class="epub-i1">ta’veren</span> was not worth two beans.</p>
<p class="tx">He kept at it, shaping his stake for the palisade. One fellow watched particularly carefully, an old farmer with skin so leathery that Trolloc swords would likely just bounce off. He looked familiar to Mat for some reason.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Burn these memories,</span> Mat thought. Undoubtedly, this fellow resembled someone from one of those old memories Mat had been given. Yes, that felt right. He could not <span class="epub-i1">quite</span> remember. A … cart? A Fade?</p>
<p class="tx">“Come on, Renald,” the fellow said to one of his companions—another farmer, Borderlander stock from the looks of him. “Let’s go on down the line, and see if we can hurry the other lads up.”</p>
<p class="tx">The two headed off as Mat finished his stake, then wiped his brow. He reached for another length of wood—he had better give these sheepherders another demonstration—when a <span class="epub-i1">cadin’sor</span>-clad figure ran up along the mostly finished palisade wall.</p>
<p class="tx">Urien had bright red hair, kept short save for the tail in the back. He raised a hand to Mat as he passed. “They are agitated, Matrim Cauthon,” Urien said, not stopping. “I believe they are coming in this direction.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Thanks,” Mat called. “I owe you.”</p>
<p class="tx">The Aiel turned as he ran, jogging backward for a second and facing Mat. “Just win this battle! I have bet a skin of <span class="epub-i1">oosquai</span> upon our success.”</p>
<p class="tx">Mat snorted. The only thing more discomforting than a stoic Aiel was a grinning one. Bet? On the outcome of this battle? What kind of bet was that? If they lost, nobody would live long enough to collect … </p>
<p class="tx">Mat frowned. Actually, that was a pretty <span class="epub-i1">good</span> bet to be making. “Who did you find to take that bet?” Mat called. “Urien?” But the man was already too far away to hear.</p>
<p class="tx">Mat grumbled, but handed his axe to one of the people nearby, a slender Tairen woman. “Keep them in line, Cynd.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes, Lord Cauthon.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m no bloody lord,” Mat said by habit as he picked up his <span class="epub-i1">ashandarei</span>. He walked off, then turned to look at the palisade being erected and caught sight of a handful of Deathwatch Guards walking along the rows of working people. Like wolves among the sheep. Mat hurried on.</p>
<p class="tx">His armies did not have much time left to prepare. Using gateways had put them ahead of the Trollocs, but they had not escaped. Light, there <span class="epub-i1">was</span> no escape. Mat had been given his choice of battlefields, though, and this Merrilor place would work best.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Like picking the plot for your own grave,</span> Mat thought. <span class="epub-i1">Sure, I’d rather not have to choose in the first place.</span></p>
<p class="tx">The palisade was rising in front of the woods east of the field. He did not have time to section off or surround the entire area with a palisade, and doing so would not make much sense anyway. With those Sharan channelers, the Shadow could rip through walls like a sword through silk. But some palisades, with catwalks on top, would give his archers height to target Trollocs.</p>
<p class="tx">Mat had two rivers to work with here. The River Mora flowed in a southwest direction, running between the Heights and Dashar Knob. Its southern bank was in Shienar, the northern bank in Arafel. It joined the River Erinin, which ran directly westward at the southern edge of the field.</p>
<p class="tx">Those rivers would serve better than any walls, particularly now that he had the resources to defend them correctly. Well, if you could call them resources. Half his soldiers were as new as spring grass and the other half had fought near to death the week before. The Borderlanders had lost two men out of three—Light, two out of <span class="epub-i1">three</span>. A lesser army would have disbanded.</p>
<p class="tx">Counting everyone he had, Mat would be outnumbered four to one when those Trollocs arrived, at least according to the reports from the Fists of Heaven. It was going to be messy.</p>
<p class="tx">Mat pulled his hat down further, then scratched at the side of the new eyepatch that Tuon had given him. Red leather. He liked it.</p>
<p class="tx">“Here now,” he said, passing some of the new Tower Guard recruits. They were sparring with quarterstaffs—spearheads were still being forged to go on the ends. The men looked more likely to hurt themselves than the enemy.</p>
<p class="tx">Mat handed his <span class="epub-i1">ashandarei</span> to a man, then took a quarterstaff from another as the first hastily saluted. Most of these men were not old enough to need to shave more than once a month. If the boy whose staff he had taken was a day over fifteen, Mat would eat his boots. He would not even boil them first!</p>
<p class="tx">“You can’t cringe every time the staff hits something!” Mat said. “Close your eyes on the battlefield, and you’re dead. Didn’t you lot pay any attention last time?”</p>
<p class="tx">Mat held up the staff, showing them where to grip it, then put them through the blocking practice his father had shown him back when he had been young enough to think fighting might actually be fun. He worked up a sweat, hitting at each of the new recruits in turn, forcing each to block.</p>
<p class="tx">“Burn me, but you <span class="epub-i1">will</span> figure this out,” Mat said loudly to all of them. “I wouldn’t care so much, as you lot seem to have the wits of stumps, but if you get yourselves killed, your mothers will be expecting me to send them word. I won’t do it, mind you. But I might feel a little guilty between games of dice, and I hate feeling guilty, so pay attention!”</p>
<p class="tx">“Lord Cauthon?” said the lad who had given him the staff.</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m not—” He stopped. “Well, yes, what is it?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Can’t we just learn the sword?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Light!” Mat said. “What’s your name?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Sigmont, sir.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Well, Sigmont, how much time do you think we have? Maybe you could wander out, talk to the Dreadlords and the Shadowspawn and ask them to give me a few more months’ time so I can train you all properly.”</p>
<p class="tx">Sigmont blushed, and Mat handed back his staff. <span class="epub-i1">City boys.</span> He sighed. “Look here, all I want is for you lot to be able to defend yourselves. I don’t have time to make you great warriors, but I <span class="epub-i1">can</span> teach you to work together, keep a formation, and not shy away when the Trollocs come. That will get you farther than any kind of fancy swordplay, trust me.”</p>
<p class="tx">The youths nodded reluctantly.</p>
<p class="tx">“Get back to your practice,” Mat said, wiping his brow and looking over his shoulder. Bloody ashes! The Deathwatch Guards were heading his way.</p>
<p class="tx">He grabbed his <span class="epub-i1">ashandarei</span> and rushed off, then ducked around the side of a tent, only to stumble into a group of Aes Sedai approaching on the path.</p>
<p class="tx">“Mat?” Egwene asked from the middle of the group of women. “Are you well?”</p>
<p class="tx">“They’re bloody chasing me,” he said, glancing around the side of the tent.</p>
<p class="tx">“Who is chasing you?” Egwene said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Deathwatch Guards,” Mat said. “I’m supposed to be back at Tuon’s tent.”</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene waved a few fingers, sending the other women off, except her two shadows—Gawyn and Leilwin, of all people—who remained with her. “Mat,” Egwene said in a suffering tone, “I’m glad you’ve finally decided to see reason and leave the Seanchan camp, but couldn’t you have waited until <span class="epub-i1">after</span> the battle was over to defect?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Sorry,” he said, only half-listening. “But can we walk on toward the Aes Sedai quarter of camp? They won’t follow me there.” Maybe not. If all Deathwatch Guards were like Karede, maybe they would. Karede would dive after a man falling off a cliff in order to catch him.</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene started back, seeming displeased with Mat. How was it Aes Sedai could be so perfectly emotionless, yet still let a man know they disapproved of him? Come to think of it, an Aes Sedai would probably follow a man off a cliff, too, if only to explain to him—in detail—all the things he was doing incorrectly in the way he went about killing himself.</p>
<p class="tx">Mat wished so many of his thoughts lately did not involve feeling like he was the one jumping off the cliff.</p>
<p class="tx">“We’ll have to find a way to explain to Fortuona why you ran,” Egwene said as they approached the Aes Sedai quarter. Mat had placed it as far from the Seanchan as was reasonable. “The marriage is going to present a problem. I suggest that you—”</p>
<p class="tx">“Wait, Egwene,” Mat said. “What are you talking about?”</p>
<p class="tx">“You are running from the Seanchan guards,” Egwene said. “Weren’t you listening … Of course you weren’t. It is pleasant to know that, as the world crumbles, a few things are completely unchangeable. <span class="epub-i1">Cuendillar</span> and Mat Cauthon.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m running from them,” Mat said, looking over his shoulder, “because Tuon wants me to sit in judgment. Any time a soldier is seeking the Empress’s mercy for a crime, <span class="epub-i1">I’m</span> the one who is supposed to bloody hear his case!”</p>
<p class="tx">“You,” Egwene said, “passing judgment?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I know,” Mat said. “Too much bloody work, if you ask me. I’ve been dodging guardsmen all day, trying to steal a little time for myself.”</p>
<p class="tx">“A little honest work wouldn’t kill you, Mat.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Now, you know that’s not true. Soldiering is honest work, and it gets men killed all the bloody time.”</p>
<p class="tx">Gawyn Trakand was apparently practicing to be an Aes Sedai sometime, because he kept giving Mat glares that would have made Moiraine proud. Well, let him. Gawyn was a prince. He had been raised to do things like pass judgment. He probably sent a few men to the gallows each day at his lunch break, just to keep in practice.</p>
<p class="tx">But Mat … Mat was not going to order men to be executed, and that was that. They passed a group of Aiel sparring together. Was this group what Urien had been running to reach? Once they had passed—Mat trying to make the others walk faster so the Seanchan would not catch up—he drew closer to Egwene.</p>
<p class="tx">“Have you found it yet?” he asked softly.</p>
<p class="tx">“No,” Egwene said, eyes forward.</p>
<p class="tx">No need to mention what <span class="epub-i1">it</span> was. “How could you have lost the thing? After all the work we bloody went through to find it?”</p>
<p class="tx">“We? From the telling I hear, Rand, Loial and the Borderlanders had far more to do with finding it than you.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I was there,” Mat said. “I rode across the entire bloody continent, didn’t I? Burn me, first Rand, then you. Is everybody going to chivvy me about those days? Gawyn, you want a turn?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes, please.” He sounded eager.</p>
<p class="tx">“Shut up,” Mat said. “It seems that nobody can remember straight but me. I hunted down that bloody Horn like a madman. And, I’ll mention, it was me blowing the thing that let you all escape Falme.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Is that how you remember it?” Egwene asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“Sure,” Mat said. “I mean, I have some holes in there, but I’ve pieced it mostly together.”</p>
<p class="tx">“And the dagger?”</p>
<p class="tx">“That trinket? Hardly worth anyone’s time.” He caught himself reaching to his side, to where he had once carried it. Egwene raised an eyebrow at him. “Anyway, that’s not the point. We’re going to need that bloody instrument, Egwene. We’ll <span class="epub-i1">need</span> it.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We have people searching,” she said. “We’re not sure exactly what happened. There was a Traveling residue, but it’s been a while and … Light, Mat. We’re trying. I promise it. It’s not the only thing the Shadow has stolen from us recently…”</p>
<p class="tx">He glanced at her, but she gave him no more. Flaming Aes Sedai. “Has anyone seen Perrin yet?” he asked. “I don’t want to be the one to tell him his wife has gone missing.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Nobody has seen him,” Egwene said. “I assume he is at work helping Rand.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Bah,” Mat said. “Can you make a gateway for me up to the top of the Knob?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I thought you wanted to go to my camp.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It’s on the way,” Mat said. Well, sort of, it was. “And those Deathwatch Guards won’t expect it. Burn me, Egwene, but I think they’ve guessed where we were heading.”</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene—after pausing for a moment—opened them a gateway to the Traveling ground atop the Knob. They stepped through onto it.</p>
<p class="tx">More than a hill, less than a mountain, Dashar Knob rose a good hundred feet into the air near the middle of the battlefield. The rock formation was unscalable, and gateways were the only way to reach the top. From here, Mat and his commanders would be able to watch the entire battle play out.</p>
<p class="tx">“I have never known anyone else,” Egwene said to him, “who will work so hard to avoid hard work, Matrim Cauthon.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You haven’t spent enough time around soldiers.” Mat waved at the men who saluted him as he walked out of the Traveling grounds.</p>
<p class="tx">He looked north toward the River Mora and across it into Arafel. Then northeast, toward the ruins of what had once been some kind of fort or watchtower. Eastward, toward the rising palisade and the forest. He continued to turn, southward to gaze at the River Erinin in the far distance, and the strange little grove of tall trees that Loial was so in awe of. They said Rand had grown those, during the meeting where the treaty had been signed. Mat looked southwest toward the only good ford on the Mora nearby, named Hawal Ford by the locals who had farmed this area; beyond the ford on the Arafel side was a large expanse of bogs.</p>
<p class="tx">Westward, across the Mora, lay Polov Heights—a forty-foot-tall plateau with a steep slope on the east and more gradual slopes on the other sides. Between the base of the southwestern slope and the bogs was a corridor roughly two hundred paces across, well worn by travelers who used the ford to cross between Arafel and Shienar. Mat could use these features to his advantage. He could use them all. Would that be enough? He could feel something pulling on him, tugging him northward. Rand would need him soon.</p>
<p class="tx">He turned, ready to bolt, as someone approached across the top of the Knob, but it was not the Deathwatch Guards. It was just leather-faced Jur Grady.</p>
<p class="tx">“I fetched those soldiers for you,” Grady said, pointing. Mat could see a small force coming through a gateway to the Traveling grounds near the palisade. A hundred men of the Band, led by Delarn, flying a bloody red flag. The Redarms were accompanied by some five hundred people in worn clothing.</p>
<p class="tx">“What was the point of this?” Grady asked. “You sent those hundred to a village in the south to recruit, I assume?”</p>
<p class="tx">That, and more. <span class="epub-i1">I saved your life, man,</span> Mat thought, trying to pick Delarn out of the group. <span class="epub-i1">And then you volunteer for this. Bloody fool.</span> Delarn acted as if it were his fate.</p>
<p class="tx">“Take them upriver,” Mat said. “The maps show there is only one good place to block the Mora, a narrow canyon a few leagues northeast of here.”</p>
<p class="tx">“All right,” Grady said. “There will be channelers involved.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You will have to handle them,” Mat said. “Mostly, though, I want you to let those six hundred men and women defend the river. Don’t risk yourself too much. Let Delarn and his people do the work.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Pardon,” Grady said. “But that doesn’t seem like a very large force. Most of them aren’t trained soldiers.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I know what I’m doing,” Mat said. <span class="epub-i1">I hope.</span></p>
<p class="tx">Grady nodded reluctantly and moved off.</p>
<p class="tx">Egwene watched Mat with curious eyes.</p>
<p class="tx">“We can’t fall back from this fight,” Mat said softly. “We don’t retreat. There isn’t anywhere to go. We stand here, or we lose it all.”</p>
<p class="tx">“There is <span class="epub-i1">always</span> a retreat,” Egwene said.</p>
<p class="tx">“No,” Mat said. “Not anymore.” He rested his <span class="epub-i1">ashandarei</span> on his shoulder, his other hand out, palm forward. He scanned the landscape, memories appearing as if from light and dust before him. Rion at Hune Hill. Naath and the San d’ma Shadar. The Fall of Pipkin. Hundreds upon hundreds of battlefields, hundreds of victories. Thousands of deaths.</p>
<p class="tx">Mat watched figments of memories flash across the field. “Have you spoken to the supply masters? We’re out of food, Egwene. We can’t win a protracted war, fighting and falling back. The enemy will overwhelm us if we do that. Just like Eyal in the Marches of Maighande. We are at our strongest now, broken though we are. Fall back, and we resign ourselves to starvation as the Trollocs destroy us.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Rand,” Egwene said. “We just have to hold out until he is victorious.”</p>
<p class="tx">“That’s true in a fashion,” Mat said, turning toward the Heights. In his mind’s eye, he saw what could come, the possibilities. He imagined riders on the Heights, like shadows. He would lose if he tried to hold those Heights, but maybe … “If Rand loses, it won’t matter. The Wheel is bloody broken, and we all become nothing, if we’re lucky. Well, we can’t do anything more about it. But here’s the thing. If he does what he’s supposed to, we could still lose—we will lose, if we don’t stop the Shadow’s armies.”</p>
<p class="tx">He blinked, seeing it, the entire battlefield spread before him. Fighting at the ford. Arrows from the palisade. “We can’t just beat them, Egwene,” Mat said. “We can’t just stand and hold on. We have to destroy them, drive them away, then hunt them to the last Trolloc. We can’t just survive … we have to <span class="epub-i1">win</span>.”</p>
<p class="tx">“How are we going to do that?” Egwene asked. “Mat, you’re not talking sense. Weren’t you just saying yesterday how outnumbered we’ll be?”</p>
<p class="tx">He looked toward the bog, imagining shadows trying to slog through it. Shadows of dust and memory. “I have to change it all,” he said. He could not do what they would expect. He could not do what spies might have reported he was planning. “Blood and bloody ashes … one last toss of the dice. Everything we have, piled into a heap…”</p>
<p class="tx">A group of men in dark armor came through a gateway to the top of the Knob, panting deeply, as if they’d had to chase down a <span class="epub-i1">damane</span> to get them up here. Their breastplates were lacquered a deep red, but this batch did not need a fearsome display to be frightening. They looked furious enough to scramble eggs with a stare.</p>
<p class="tx">“You,” said the lead Deathwatch Guard, a man named Gelen, pointing at Mat, “are <span class="epub-i1">needed</span> at the—”</p>
<p class="tx">Mat held up a hand to cut him off.</p>
<p class="tx">“I will not be denied again!” Gelen said. “I have orders from—”</p>
<p class="tx">Mat shot the man a glare, and he stopped short. Mat turned northward again. A cool, somehow <span class="epub-i1">familiar</span> wind blew across him, rippling his long coat, brushing at his hat. He narrowed his eye. Rand was tugging on him.</p>
<p class="tx">The dice still tumbled in his head.</p>
<p class="tx">“They’re here,” Mat said.</p>
<p class="tx">“What did you say?” Egwene asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“They’re here.”</p>
<p class="tx">“The scouts—”</p>
<p class="tx">“The scouts are wrong,” Mat said. He looked up, and noticed a pair of <span class="epub-i1">raken</span> speeding back toward the camp. They had seen it. The Trollocs must have marched through the night.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Sharans will come first,</span> Mat thought, <span class="epub-i1">to give the Trollocs a breather. They’ll have arrived through gateways.</span></p>
<p class="tx">“Send runners,” Mat said, pointing at the Deathwatch Guards, “get the men and women to their posts. And warn Elayne that I’m going to change the battle plan.”</p>
<p class="tx">“What?” Egwene said.</p>
<p class="tx">“They’re <span class="epub-i1">here</span>!” Mat said, turning on the Guards. “Why aren’t you bloody running! Go, <span class="epub-i1">go</span>!” Above, the <span class="epub-i1">raken</span> screeched. Gelen, to his credit, saluted, then ran—pounding in that massive armor—with his companions.</p>
<p class="tx">“This is it, Egwene,” Mat said. “Take a deep breath, a last pull on the brandy, or burn your final pinch of tabac. Have a good look at the ground before you, as it’s soon going to be covered in blood. In an hour, we’ll be in the thick of it. The Light watch over us all.”</p>

<p class="tni">Perrin drifted in darkness. He felt so <span class="epub-i1">tired</span>.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Slayer still lives,</span> a piece of himself thought. <span class="epub-i1">Graendal is corrupting the great captains. The end is near. You can’t slip away now! Hold on.</span></p>
<p class="tx">Hold on to what? He tried to open his eyes, but was so exhausted. He should.… should have gotten out of the wolf dream sooner. His entire body felt numb, except … </p>
<p class="tx">Except for his side. Moving fingers that felt like bricks, he touched the warmth. His hammer. It was blazing hot. That warmth seemed to move up his fingers, and Perrin took a deep breath.</p>
<p class="tx">He needed to wake up. He hovered at the edges of consciousness, as when he was close to sleep, but still partially aware. In that state, he felt as if he faced a forked pathway before him. One path led deeper into darkness. And one led … He couldn’t see, but he knew that it meant … It meant waking up.</p>
<p class="tx">Warmth from the hammer radiated up his arm. His mind gathered sharpness. <span class="epub-i1">Awaken.</span></p>
<p class="tx">That was what Slayer had done. He had … awakened … somehow … </p>
<p class="tx">Perrin’s life was trickling away. Not much time left. Half within death’s embrace, he gritted his teeth, drew in a deep breath and forced himself to <span class="epub-i1">wake</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">The silence of the wolf dream shattered.</p>
<p class="tx">Perrin hit soft earth, and entered a place of shouts. Something about a battlefront, about preparing the lines … </p>
<p class="tx">Nearby, someone cried out. And then someone else. And others.</p>
<p class="tx">“Perrin?” He knew that voice. “Perrin, lad!”</p>
<p class="tx">Master Luhhan? Perrin’s eyelids felt so heavy. He couldn’t open them. Arms grabbed him.</p>
<p class="tx">“Hang on. I have you, lad. I have you. <span class="epub-i1">Hang on.</span>”</p>
