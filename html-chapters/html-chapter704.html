<p class="chapterOpenerText">“We thought it best,” Seonid said, “to let one of us give the full report. I have gathered information from the others for presentation.”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin nodded absently. He sat on cushions in the meeting pavilion, Faile at his side. It was crammed full of people again.</p>
<p class="para">“Cairhien is still in a mess, of course,” Seonid began. The businesslike Green was a curt woman. Not mean or disagreeable, but even her interactions with her Warders seemed like those of a prosperous farmer with his workers. “The Sun Throne has remained unoccupied for far too long. All know that the Lord Dragon has promised the throne to Elayne Trakand, but she has been struggling to secure her own throne. She has finally done so, by reports.”</p>
<p class="para">She looked to Perrin for comment, smelling satisfied. He scratched at his beard. This was important, and he needed to pay attention. But thoughts of his training in the wolf dream kept drawing his mind. “So Elayne is Queen. That must make Rand happy.”</p>
<p class="para">“The Lord Dragon’s reaction is unknown,” Seonid continued, as if checking off another item on a list. The Wise Ones made no comments and asked no questions; they sat on their cushions in a little cluster, like rivets on a hinge. Likely, the Maidens had already told them all of this.</p>
<p class="para">“I am reasonably certain that the Lord Dragon is in Arad Doman,” Seonid continued. “Several rumors speak of this—though, of course, there are rumors placing him in many places. But Arad Doman makes sense for him as a tactical conquest, and the unrest there threatens to destabilize the Borderlands. I’m not certain if it’s true that he sent the Aiel there or not.”</p>
<p class="para">“He did,” Edarra said simply. She offered no further explanation.</p>
<p class="para">“Yes,” Seonid said. “Well, many of the rumors say that he is planning to meet the Seanchan in Arad Doman. I suspect he would want the clans there to aid him.”</p>
<p class="para">That brought up thoughts of Malden. Perrin imagined <span class="italic1">damane</span> and Wise Ones at war, the One Power ripping through ranks of soldiers, blood, earth and fire spinning in the air. It would be like Dumai’s Wells, only worse. He shivered. Anyway, from the visions—and they appeared as Seonid spoke—he knew that Rand was where she said.</p>
<p class="para">Seonid continued, speaking of trade and food resources in Cairhien. Perrin found himself thinking about that strange violet wall he’d seen in the wolf dream. <span class="italic1">Idiot,</span> he told himself sternly. <span class="italic1">Keep listening.</span> Light! He really was a bad ruler. He’d had no trouble running at the front of the wolves when they’d let him hunt. Why couldn’t he do the same for his own people?</p>
<p class="para">“Tear is rallying troops,” Seonid said. “Rumors say the Lord Dragon commanded King Darlin to gather men for war. There is apparently a king in Tear now, by the way. A curious event. Some say that Darlin will march for Arad Doman, though others say it must be for the Last Battle. Still others insist that al’Thor intends to defeat the Seanchan first. All three options seem plausible, and I can’t give more without a trip to Tear myself.” She eyed Perrin, smelling hopeful.</p>
<p class="para">“No,” Perrin said. “Not yet. Rand isn’t in Cairhien, but Andor seems stable. It makes the most sense for me to head there and talk to Elayne. She’ll have information for us.”</p>
<p class="para">Faile smelled worried.</p>
<p class="para">“Lord Aybara,” Seonid said, “do you think the Queen will welcome you? With the flag of Manetheren, and your self-endowed title of Lord…”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin scowled. “Both of those fool banners are down now, and Elayne will see things right, once I explain them to her.”</p>
<p class="para">“And my soldiers?” Alliandre said. “You will probably want to ask before moving foreign troops onto Andoran soil.”</p>
<p class="para">“You <span class="italic1">won’t</span> be coming,” Perrin said. “I’ve said it before, Alliandre. You’ll be in Jehannah. We’ll get you there as soon as we deal with the Whitecloaks.”</p>
<p class="para">“Has a decision been made about them, then?” Arganda asked, leaning forward, eager and excited.</p>
<p class="para">“They’ve demanded a battle,” Perrin said. “And they ignore my requests for further parley. I’ve a mind to give them a fight.”</p>
<p class="para">They began talking of that, though it soon became a discussion of what it meant to have a king in Tear. Eventually, Seonid cleared her throat and steered the conversation back to her report.</p>
<p class="para">“The Seanchan are a matter of great discussion in Cairhien,” Seonid said. “The invaders seem to be focusing on securing their lands, including Altara. They are still expanding in the west, however, and there are pitched battles on Almoth Plain.”</p>
<p class="para">“Expanding toward Arad Doman,” Arganda said. “There <span class="italic1">is</span> a battle brewing there.”</p>
<p class="para">“Most likely,” Seonid said.</p>
<p class="para">“If the Last Battle comes,” Annoura said, “then it would be advantageous to have an alliance with the Seanchan.” She seemed thoughtful, legs crossed as she sat on her embroidered blue and yellow silk pillow.</p>
<p class="para">“They have chained Wise Ones,” Edarra said, her too-young face growing dark. She smelled dangerous. Angry but cold, like the smell before a person planned to kill. “Not just Shaido, who deserve their fate. If there is an alliance with the Seanchan, it will end as soon as the <span class="italic1">Car’a’carn</span>’s work is finished. Already, many of my people speak of a blood feud with these invaders.”</p>
<p class="para">“I doubt Rand wants a war between you,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para">“A year and a day,” Edarra said simply. “Wise Ones cannot be taken <span class="italic1">gai’shain</span>, but perhaps the Seanchan ways are different. Regardless, we will give them a year and a day. If they do not release their captives when we demand them after that time, they will know our spears. The <span class="italic1">Car’a’carn</span> cannot demand any more from us.”</p>
<p class="para">The pavilion grew still.</p>
<p class="para">“Anyway,” Seonid said, clearing her throat. “Once finished with Cairhien, we met up with those who had gone to Andor to check on rumors there.”</p>
<p class="para">“Wait,” Perrin said. “Andor?”</p>
<p class="para">“The Wise Ones decided to send Maidens there.”</p>
<p class="para">“That wasn’t the plan,” Perrin growled, looking at the Wise Ones.</p>
<p class="para">“You don’t control us, Perrin Aybara,” Edarra said calmly. “We needed to know if there were still Aiel in the city or not, and if the <span class="italic1">Car’a’carn</span> was there. Your Asha’man complied when we asked them for the gateway.”</p>
<p class="para">“The Maidens could have been seen,” he grumbled. Well, he <span class="italic1">had</span> told Grady to do the gateways as the Aiel asked him, though he’d been referring to the timing of the departure and the return. He should have been more precise.</p>
<p class="para">“Well, they weren’t seen,” Seonid sounded exasperated, like one talking with a foolish child. “At least not by anyone they didn’t intend to speak with.” Light! Was it him, or was she beginning to seem a lot like a Wise One? Was that what Seonid and the others were doing in the Aiel camp? Learning to become <span class="italic1">more</span> stubborn? Light help them all.</p>
<p class="para">“Regardless,” Seonid continued, “it was wise of us to visit Caemlyn. Rumor cannot be trusted, particularly not when one of the Forsaken was said to be operating in the area.”</p>
<p class="para">“One of the Forsaken?” Gallenne asked. “In Andor?”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin nodded, waving for another cup of warmed tea. “Rand said it was Rahvin, though I was in the Two Rivers when the battle happened.” The colors swirled in Perrin’s head. “Rahvin was impersonating one of the local noblemen, a man named Gabral or Gabil or some such. He used the Queen—made her fall in love with him, or something—and then killed her.”</p>
<p class="para">A serving tray hit the ground with a muted peal.</p>
<p class="para">Porcelain cups shattered, tea spraying into the air. Perrin spun, cursing, and several of the Maidens leaped to their feet, clutching belt knives.</p>
<p class="para">Maighdin stood, looking stunned, arms at her sides. The fallen tray lay on the ground before her.</p>
<p class="para">“Maighdin!” Faile said. “Are you all right?”</p>
<p class="para">The sun-haired serving woman turned to Perrin, looking dazed. “If you please, my Lord, will you repeat what you said?”</p>
<p class="para">“What?” Perrin asked. “Woman, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="para">“You said one of the Forsaken had taken up residence in Andor,” Maighdin said, voice calm. She gave him as sharp a look as he’d gotten from any Aes Sedai. “Are you certain of what you heard?”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin settled back on his cushion, scratching his chin. “Sure as I can be. It’s been some time, now, but I know Rand was convinced. He fought <span class="italic1">someone</span> with the One Power in the Andoran palace.”</p>
<p class="para">“His name was Gaebril,” Sulin said. “I was there. Lightning struck from an open sky, and there was no doubt it was the One Power. It was one of the Shadowsouled.”</p>
<p class="para">“There were some in Andor who claimed the <span class="italic1">Car’a’carn</span> spoke of this,” Edarra added. “He said that this Gaebril had been using forbidden weaves on wetlanders in the palace, twisting their minds, making them think and do as he wished.”</p>
<p class="para">“Maighdin, what’s wrong?” Perrin asked. “Light, woman, he’s dead now! You needn’t fear.”</p>
<p class="para">“I must be excused,” Maighdin said. She walked from the pavilion, leaving the tray and broken porcelain, bone white, scattered on the ground.</p>
<p class="para">“I will see to her later,” Faile said, embarrassed. “She is distraught to find that she’d lived so close to one of the Forsaken. Perhaps she has family in Caemlyn.”</p>
<p class="para">The others nodded, and other servants moved forward to clean up the mess. Perrin realized he wasn’t going to be getting any more tea. <span class="italic1">Fool man,</span> he thought. <span class="italic1">You lived most your life without being able to order tea on command. You won’t die now that you can’t get a refill by waving your hand.</span></p>
<p class="para">“Let’s move on,” he said, settling on his cushions. He could never quite get comfortable on the blasted things.</p>
<p class="para">“My report is finished,” Seonid said, pointedly ignoring the servant who was cleaning up porcelain shards in front of her.</p>
<p class="para">“I stand by my earlier decision,” Perrin said. “Dealing with the Whitecloaks is important. After that we’ll go to Andor, and I’ll talk to Elayne. Grady, how are you managing?”</p>
<p class="para">The weathered Asha’man looked up from where he sat in his black coat. “I’m fully recovered from my sickness, my Lord, and Neald almost is as well.”</p>
<p class="para">“You still look tired,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para">“I am,” Grady said, “but burn me, I’m better than I was many a day in the field before I went to the Black Tower.”</p>
<p class="para">“It’s time to start sending some of these refugees where they belong,” Perrin said. “With those circles, you can keep a gateway open longer?”</p>
<p class="para">“I’m not right sure. Being in a circle is still tiring. Maybe more so. But I can make much larger gateways with the help of the women, wide enough to drive two wagons through.”</p>
<p class="para">“Good. We’ll start by sending the ordinary folk home. Each person we see back where they belong will be a stone off my back.”</p>
<p class="para">“And if they don’t want to go?” Tam asked. “A lot of them have started the training, Perrin. They know what’s coming, and they’d rather face it here—with you—than cower in their homes.”</p>
<p class="para">Light! Were there no people in this camp who wanted to go back to their families? “Surely there are <span class="italic1">some</span> of them who want to go back.”</p>
<p class="para">“Some,” Tam said.</p>
<p class="para">“Remember,” Faile said, “the weak and the aged were sent away by the Aiel.”</p>
<p class="para">Arganda nodded. “I’ve looked in on these troops. More and more of the <span class="italic1">gai’shain</span> are coming out of their stupor, and when they do, they’re hard. Hard as many soldiers I’ve known.”</p>
<p class="para">“Some will want to check on family,” Tam said, “but only if you’ll let them back. They can see that sky. They know what’s coming.”</p>
<p class="para">“For now, we’ll send back the ones that want to go and remain in their homes,” Perrin said. “I can’t deal with the others until after I’m done with the Whitecloaks.”</p>
<p class="para">“Excellent,” Gallenne said eagerly. “You have a plan of attack?”</p>
<p class="para">“Well,” Perrin said, “I figure that if they’re going to be companionable enough to line up, we’ll have at them with my archers and channelers and destroy them.”</p>
<p class="para">“I approve of this plan,” Gallenne said, “so long as my men can charge to deal with the rabble left at the end.”</p>
<p class="para">“Balwer,” Perrin said. “Write the Whitecloaks. Tell them we’ll fight, and that they should pick a place.”</p>
<p class="para">As he said the words, he felt a strange reluctance. It seemed such a waste to kill so many who could fight against the Shadow. But he didn’t see a way around it.</p>
<p class="para">Balwer nodded, smelling fierce. What had the Whitecloaks done to Balwer? The dusty secretary was fascinated with them.</p>
<p class="para">The meeting began to break up. Perrin stepped to the tent’s open side and watched the separate groups leave, Alliandre and Arganda moving toward their section of the camp. Faile walked beside Berelain; oddly, the two were chatting together. Their scents said they were angry, but their words sounded companionable. What were those two up to?</p>
<p class="para">Only a few wet stains on the ground inside the tent remained of the dropped tray. What was wrong with Maighdin? Erratic behavior like that was disturbing; all too often, it was followed by some manifestation of the Dark One’s power.</p>
<p class="para">“My Lord?” a voice asked, preceded by a quiet cough. Perrin turned, realizing that Balwer was waiting behind him. The secretary stood with hands clasped before him, looking like a pile of sticks that children had dressed up in an old shirt and coat.</p>
<p class="para">“Yes?” Perrin asked.</p>
<p class="para">“I happened to overhear several items of, ah, some interest while visiting the scholars of Cairhien.”</p>
<p class="para">“You found the supplies, right?”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, yes. I am quite well stocked. Please, a moment. I do believe you’ll be interested in what I overheard.”</p>
<p class="para">“Go ahead, then,” Perrin said, walking back into the pavilion. The last of the others had left.</p>
<p class="para">Balwer spoke in a soft voice. “First off, my Lord, it appears that the Children of the Light are in league with the Seanchan. It is common knowledge now, and I worry that the force ahead of us was planted to—”</p>
<p class="para">“Balwer,” Perrin interrupted, “I know you hate the Whitecloaks, but you’ve already told me that news a half-dozen times over.”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, but—”</p>
<p class="para">“Nothing more about the Whitecloaks,” Perrin said, holding up a hand. “Unless it’s <span class="italic1">specific</span> news about this force ahead of us. Do you have any of that?”</p>
<p class="para">“No, my Lord.”</p>
<p class="para">“All right, then. Was there anything else you wanted to tell me?”</p>
<p class="para">Balwer showed no signs of annoyance, but Perrin could smell dissatisfaction. Light knew that the Whitecloaks had plenty to answer for, and Perrin didn’t blame Balwer for his hatred, but it did grow wearying.</p>
<p class="para">“Well, my Lord,” Balwer continued, “I would hazard that the tales of the Dragon Reborn wanting a truce with the Seanchan are more than idle hearsay. Several sources indicate that he has sued their leader for peace.”</p>
<p class="para">“But what did he do to his hand?” Perrin asked, dispelling yet another image of Rand from his vision.</p>
<p class="para">“What was that, my Lord?”</p>
<p class="para">“Nothing,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para">“In addition,” Balwer said, reaching into his sleeve, “there are an alarming number of these traveling among cutpurses, slipfingers and footpads in Cairhien.” He pulled out a sheet of paper with a sketch of Perrin’s face on it. The likeness was alarmingly good. Perrin took the paper, frowning. There were no words on it. Balwer handed him a second one, identical to the first. A third paper followed, this one with a picture of Mat.</p>
<p class="para">“Where did you get these?” Perrin asked.</p>
<p class="para">“As I said, my Lord,” Balwer continued, “they are being passed around in certain circles. Apparently there are very large sums of money promised to anyone who can produce your corpse, though I could not determine who would be doing the paying.”</p>
<p class="para">“And you discovered these while visiting the scholars at Rand’s school?” Perrin asked.</p>
<p class="para">The pinch-faced scribe displayed no emotion.</p>
<p class="para">“Who are you really, Balwer?”</p>
<p class="para">“A secretary. With some measure of skill in finding secrets.”</p>
<p class="para">“Some measure? Balwer, I haven’t asked after your past. I figure a man deserves to be able to start fresh. But now the Whitecloaks are here, and you have some connection to them. I need to know what it is.”</p>
<p class="para">Balwer stood silently for a time. The raised walls of the pavilion rustled.</p>
<p class="para">“My previous employer was a man I respected, my Lord,” Balwer said. “He was killed by the Children of the Light. Some among them may recognize me.”</p>
<p class="para">“You were a spy for this person?” Perrin asked.</p>
<p class="para">Balwer’s lips turned down distinctly. He spoke more softly. “I merely have a mind for remembering facts, my Lord.”</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, you’ve got a very good mind for it. Your service is useful to me, Balwer. I’m only trying to tell you that. I’m glad you’re here.”</p>
<p class="para">The man smelled pleased. “If I may say, my Lord, it is refreshing to work for someone who doesn’t see my information as simply a means of betraying or compromising those around him.”</p>
<p class="para">“Well, be that as it may, I should probably start paying you better,” Perrin said.</p>
<p class="para">That gave Balwer a panicked scent. “That won’t be necessary.”</p>
<p class="para">“You could demand high wages from any number of lords or merchants!”</p>
<p class="para">“Petty men of no consequence,” Balwer said with a twitch of his fingers.</p>
<p class="para">“Yes, but I still think you should be paid more. It’s simple sense. If you hire an apprentice blacksmith for your forge and don’t pay him well enough, he’ll impress your regular customers, then open a new forge across the street the moment he can afford to.”</p>
<p class="para">“Ah, but you do not see, my Lord,” Balwer said. “Money means nothing to me. The information—that is what is important. Facts and discoveries…they are like nuggets of gold. I could give that gold to a common banker to make coins, but I prefer to give it to the master craftsman to make something of beauty.</p>
<p class="para">“Please, my Lord, let me remain a simple secretary. You see, one of the easiest ways to tell if someone is not what he seems is to check his wages.” He chuckled. “I’ve uncovered more than one assassin or spy that way, yes I have. No pay is needed. The opportunity to work with you is its own payment.”</p>
<p class="para">Perrin shrugged, but nodded, and Balwer withdrew. Perrin stepped out of the pavilion, stowing the pictures in his pocket. They disturbed him. He’d bet these pictures were in Andor, too, placed by the Forsaken.</p>
<p class="para">For the first time, he found himself wondering if he was going to <span class="italic1">need</span> an army to keep himself safe. It was a disturbing thought.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">The wave of bestial Trollocs surged over the top of the hill, overrunning the last of the fortifications. They grunted and howled, thick-fingered hands tearing at the dark Saldaean soil and clutching swords, hooked spears, hammers, clubs and other wicked weapons. Spittle dripped from tusked lips on some, while on others wide, too-human eyes stared out from behind wicked beaks. Their black armor was decorated with spikes.</p>
<p class="para">Ituralde’s men stood strong with him at the bottom of the back slope of the hillside. He had ordered the lower camp to disband and retreat as far as they could to the south along the riverbank. Meanwhile, the army had retreated from the fortifications. He hated to surrender the high ground, but getting pushed down that steep hill during an assault would have been deadly. He had room to fall back, so he’d use it, now that the fortifications were lost.</p>
<p class="para">He positioned his forces just at the base of the hill, near where the lower camp had once been. The Domani soldiers wore steel caps and had set their fourteen-foot pikes with butts in the dirt, holding them for more stability, steel points toward the towering wave of Trollocs. A classic defensive position: three ranks of pikemen and shieldmen, pikes slanted toward the top of the slope. When the first rank of pikes killed a Trolloc, they’d fall back and pull their weapons free, letting the second rank step forward to kill. A slow, careful retreat, rank by rank.</p>
<p class="para">A double row of archers behind began loosing arrows, slamming wave after wave up into the Shadowspawn, dropping bodies down the slope. Those rolled, some still screaming, spraying dark blood. A larger number continued down, over their brothers, trying to get at the pikemen.</p>
<p class="para">An eagle-headed Trolloc died on a pike in front of Ituralde. There were chips along the edges of the thing’s beak, and its head—set with predatory eyes—sat atop a bull-like neck, the edge of the feathers coated with some kind of dark, oily substance. The monster screeched as it died, voice low and only faintly avian, somehow forming guttural sounds in the Trolloc language.</p>
<p class="para">“Hold!” Ituralde called, turning and trotting his horse down the line of pikemen. “Keep the formation, burn you!”</p>
<p class="para">The Trollocs surged down the hillside, dying on those pikes. It would be a temporary reprieve. There were too many Trollocs, and even a rotating triple pike line would be overwhelmed. This was a delaying tactic. Behind them, the rest of his troops began their retreat. Once the lines had weakened, the Asha’man would assume the burden of defense, buying time for the pikemen to retreat.</p>
<p class="para">If the Asha’man could manage the strength. He’d pushed them hard. Maybe too hard. He didn’t know their limits the way he did for ordinary troops. If they were able to break the Trolloc advance, his army would fall back southward. That retreat would take them past the safety of Maradon, but they would not be allowed in. Those inside had rebuffed all Ituralde’s attempts at communication. “We do not abet invaders” had been the reply each time. Bloody fools.</p>
<p class="para">Well, the Trollocs would likely form up around Maradon for a sustained siege, giving Ituralde and his men time to fall back to a more defensible position.</p>
<p class="para">“Hold!” Ituralde called again, riding past an area where the Trolloc press was beginning to show results. Atop one of the hilltop fortifications, a pack of wolf-headed Trollocs lurked, wary, while their companions charged down before them. “Archers!” Ituralde said, pointing.</p>
<p class="para">A volley of arrows followed, spraying the wolf-headed Trollocs, or “Minds” as the Dragonsworn in Ituralde’s army had started calling them. Trollocs had their own bands and organization, but his men often referred to individuals by the features they displayed. “Horns” for goats, “Beaks” for hawks, “Arms” for bears. Those with the heads of wolves were often among the more intelligent; some Saldaeans claimed to have heard them speaking the human language to bargain with or trick their opponents.</p>
<p class="para">Ituralde knew much about Trollocs now. You needed to know your enemy. Unfortunately, there was huge variety in Trolloc intelligence and personality. And there were many Trollocs who shared physical attributes from various groups. Ituralde swore he’d seen one twisted abomination with the feathers of a hawk but the horns of a goat.</p>
<p class="para">The Trollocs atop the fortification tried to get out of the way of the arrows. A large pack of hulking beasts behind shoved them down the hill with a roar. Trollocs were cowardly things, normally, unless hungry, but if they were whipped into a frenzy, they fought well.</p>
<p class="para">The Fades would follow this initial wave. Once the archers were out of arrows, and Trollocs had softened the men below. Ituralde didn’t look forward to that.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Light,</span> Ituralde thought. <span class="italic1">I hope we can outrun them.</span> The Asha’man waited in the distance for his order. He wished he had them closer. But he couldn’t risk it. They were too important an asset to lose to a stray arrow.</p>
<p class="para">Hopefully, the front ranks of Trollocs would be severely battered by the pikemen, their carcasses twisted and banked against the pikes—and the Trollocs behind stumbling and falling against their own bloody remnants. Ituralde’s remaining Saldaeans would ride as a harrying force at any who got through the Asha’man blasts. Then the pikemen should be able to draw back and follow the rest of the army in retreat. Once past Maradon, they could use gateways to fall back to his next chosen position, a forested pass some ten leagues south.</p>
<p class="para">His men <span class="italic1">should</span> be able to escape. Should. Light, but he hated being forced to command a too-fast retreat like this.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Stay firm,</span> he told himself, continuing to ride and call out the order to hold. It was important that they hear his voice. <span class="italic1">That boy is the Dragon Reborn. He’ll keep his promises.</span></p>
<p class="para">“My Lord!” a voice called. Ituralde’s guard split to let a young boy ride up, panting. “My Lord, it’s Lieutenant Lidrin!”</p>
<p class="para">“He’s fallen?” Ituralde demanded.</p>
<p class="para">“No, my Lord. He’s…” The boy looked over his shoulder. In the pike line nearby, the soldiers were bulging forward <span class="italic1">toward</span> the Trolloc wave, rather than falling back.</p>
<p class="para">“What in the Light?” Ituralde said, heeling Dawnweave into motion. The white gelding galloped forward, Ituralde’s guard and the young messenger joining him in a thunder of hooves.</p>
<p class="para">He could hear Lidrin’s yells despite the roar of the battlefield. The young Domani officer was out in front of the pike lines, attacking the Trollocs with sword and shield, bellowing. Lidrin’s men had pushed through to defend him, leaving the pikemen confused and disoriented.</p>
<p class="para">“Lidrin, you fool.” Ituralde reined his horse to a halt.</p>
<p class="para">“Come!” Lidrin bellowed, raising his sword up before the Trollocs. He laughed loudly, voice half-mad, face splattered with blood. “Come! I will face you all! My sword thirsts!”</p>
<p class="para">“Lidrin!” Ituralde screamed. “Lidrin!”</p>
<p class="para">The man glanced over his shoulder. His eyes were wide with a crazed kind of glee. Ituralde had seen it before, in the eyes of soldiers who fought too long, too hard. “We’re going to die, Rodel,” Lidrin called. “This way, I get to take them with me! One or two at least! Join me!”</p>
<p class="para">“Lidrin, get back here and—”</p>
<p class="para">The man ignored him, turning back and pressing forward.</p>
<p class="para">“Get his men back here,” Ituralde yelled, gesturing. “Close the pike ranks! Quickly. We can’t…”</p>
<p class="para">The Trollocs surged forward. Lidrin fell in a spray of blood, laughing. His men were too strongly pressed, and they split down the middle. The pikemen reset themselves, but a fist of Trollocs crashed into them. Some Trollocs fell.</p>
<p class="para">Most didn’t.</p>
<p class="para">The nearby creatures screeched and howled at seeing the hole in the defenses. They came, scrambling over bodies at the base of the hill, throwing themselves at the pikemen.</p>
<p class="para">Ituralde cursed, then pushed Dawnweave forward. In war, as in farming, you sometimes had to step in and get knee-deep in the muck. He bellowed as he crashed into the Trollocs. His guard rode in around him, closing the gap. The air became a crashing tempest of metal on metal and grunts of pain.</p>
<p class="para">Dawnweave snorted and danced as Ituralde lashed out with his sword. The warhorse disliked being so close to the Shadowspawn, but he was well trained, a gift from one of Bashere’s men. He had claimed that a general on the Borderlands needed an animal who had fought Trollocs before. Ituralde blessed that soldier now.</p>
<p class="para">The fighting was brutal. The leading rank of pikemen, and those behind, began buckling. Ituralde briefly heard Ankaer’s voice taking command, screaming at the men to get back into line. He sounded frantic. That was bad.</p>
<p class="para">Ituralde swung, doing Heron on the Stump—a horseback sword form—and taking a bull-headed Trolloc across the throat. A spray of fetid brownish blood spurted forth, and the creature fell back against a boar-headed monster. A large red standard—depicting a goat’s skull with a fire burning behind it—rose atop the hill. The symbol of the Ghob’hlin Band.</p>
<p class="para">Ituralde turned his horse, dancing out of the way of a wicked axe blow, then urged his mount forward, driving his sword into the Trolloc’s side. Around him, Whelborn and Lehynen—two of his best—died as they defended his flank. Light burn the Trollocs!</p>
<p class="para">The entire line was breaking apart. He and his men were too few, but most of his forces had already pulled back. <span class="italic1">No, no, no!</span> Ituralde thought, trying to extricate himself from the battle and take over the command. But if he pulled back, the Trollocs would break through.</p>
<p class="para">He’d have to risk it. He was ready for problems like this.</p>
<p class="para">A trumpet sounded retreat.</p>
<p class="para">Ituralde froze, listening with horror to the haunted sound rolling across the battlefield. The horns weren’t supposed to blow unless he, or a member of his guard, gave the order personally! It was too soon, <span class="italic1">far</span> too soon.</p>
<p class="para">Some of the other trumpeters heard the call and took it up, though others did not. They could see that it was far too soon. Unfortunately, that was <span class="italic1">worse</span>. It meant that half of the pikemen began to pull back while the other half held their position.</p>
<p class="para">The lines around Ituralde burst, men scattering as the Trollocs swarmed over them. It was a disaster, as bad a disaster as Ituralde had ever been part of. His fingers felt limp.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">If we fall, Shadowspawn destroy Arad Doman.</span></p>
<p class="para">Ituralde roared, yanking on the reins of his horse and galloping back away from the surging Trollocs. The remaining members of his guard followed.</p>
<p class="para">“Helmke and Cutaris,” Ituralde yelled to two of his men, sturdy, long-limbed Domani. “Get to Durhem’s cavalry and tell them to attack the center as soon as an opening appears! Kappre, head to Alin’s cavalry. Order him to assault the Trollocs on the eastern flank. Sorrentin, go to those Asha’man! I want the Trollocs to go up in flame!”</p>
<p class="para">The horsemen galloped off. Ituralde rode westward, to the place where the pikemen were still holding. He started to rally one of the back ranks and bring it to the bulging section. He almost had it working. But then the Myrddraal came, sliding through the Trolloc ranks like snakes, striking with oily speed, and a flight of Draghkar descended.</p>
<p class="para">Ituralde found himself fighting for his life.</p>
<p class="para">Around him, the battlefield was a terrible mess: ranks destroyed, Trollocs roaming freely for easy kills, Myrddraal trying to whip them into attacking the few remaining pike formations instead.</p>
<p class="para">Fires flew in the air as the Asha’man aimed for the Trollocs, but their fires were smaller, weaker than they had been days ago. Men screamed, weapons clanged, and beasts roared in the smoke beneath a sky of too-black clouds.</p>
<p class="para">Ituralde was breathing hard. His guards had fallen. At least he had seen Staven and Rett die. What of the others? He didn’t see them. So many dying. So many. There was sweat in his eyes.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">Light,</span> he thought. <span class="italic1">At least we gave them a fight. Held out longer than I thought possible.</span></p>
<p class="para">There were columns of smoke to the north. Well, one thing had gone well—that Asha’man Tymoth had done his job. The second set of siege equipment was burning. Some of his officers had called it madness to send away one of his Asha’man, but one more channeler wouldn’t have mattered in this disaster. And when the Trollocs attacked Maradon, the lack of those catapults would make a big difference.</p>
<p class="para">Dawnweave fell. A Trolloc javelin that had been meant for Ituralde had fallen low. The horse screamed with the weapon lodged in its neck, blood pulsing down its sweat-frothed skin. Ituralde had lost mounts before, and he knew to roll to the side, but was too off-balance this time. He heard his leg snap as he hit.</p>
<p class="para">He gritted his teeth, determined not to die on his back, and forced himself up into a sitting position. He dropped his sword—heron-mark though it was—and lifted up a broken, discarded pike in a fluid motion and rammed it through the chest of an approaching Trolloc. Dark, stinking blood coated the shaft, spurting down onto Ituralde’s hands as the Trolloc screamed and died.</p>
<p class="para">There was thunder in the air. That wasn’t odd—there was often thunder from those clouds, often eerily disjointed from the bursts of lightning.</p>
<p class="para">Ituralde heaved, pushing the Trolloc to the side by levering the pike. Then a Myrddraal saw him.</p>
<p class="para">Ituralde reached for his sword, gritting his teeth, but knew he had just seen his killer. One of those things could fell a dozen men. Facing it with a broken leg…</p>
<p class="para">He tried to stumble to his feet anyway. He failed, falling backward, cursing. He raised his sword, prepared to die as the thing slunk forward, movements like liquid.</p>
<p class="para">A dozen arrows slammed into the Fade.</p>
<p class="para">Ituralde blinked as the creature stumbled. The thunder was getting louder. Ituralde propped himself up, and was amazed to see thousands of unfamiliar horsemen charging in formation through the Trolloc ranks, sweeping the creatures before them.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic1">The Dragon Reborn! He came!</span></p>
<p class="para">But no. These men flew the Saldaean flag. He looked back. The gates of Maradon were open, and Ituralde’s tired survivors were being allowed to limp inside. Fire was flying from the battlements—his Asha’man had been allowed up top to get a vantage on the battlefield.</p>
<p class="para">A force of twenty horsemen broke off and ran down the Myrddraal, trampling it. The last man in the group leaped free of his saddle and hacked at the creature with a hand axe. All across the battlefield, the Trollocs were run down, shot or lanced.</p>
<p class="para">It wouldn’t last. More and more Trollocs were rolling through Ituralde’s former fortifications and loping down the slope. But the Saldaean relief would be enough, with those gates open, and with the Asha’man blasting wreaking destruction. The remnants of Ituralde’s force were fleeing to safety. He was proud to see Barettal and Connel—the last of his guard—stumbling across the field toward him on foot, their mounts no doubt dead, their uniforms bloodied.</p>
<p class="para">He slid his sword into its scabbard and pulled the javelin from Dawnweave’s neck. Supporting himself on it, he managed to stand. A rider from the Saldaean force trotted up to him, a man with a lean face, a hooked nose, and a set of bushy black eyebrows. He wore a short, trimmed beard, and he raised a bloodied sword to Ituralde. “You live.”</p>
<p class="para">“I do,” Ituralde said as his two guards arrived. “You command this force?”</p>
<p class="para">“For now,” the man said. “I am Yoeli. Can you ride?”</p>
<p class="para">“Better that than staying here.”</p>
<p class="para">Yoeli reached out a hand and pulled Ituralde into his saddle behind him. Ituralde’s leg protested with a flare of pain, but there wasn’t time to wait for a stretcher.</p>
<p class="para">Two other horsemen took Ituralde’s guards onto their horses, and soon they three were riding for the city at a gallop.</p>
<p class="para">“Bless you,” Ituralde said. “It took you long enough, though.”</p>
<p class="para">“I know.” Yoeli’s voice sounded oddly grim. “I hope you are worth this, invader, for my actions this day will likely cost my life.”</p>
<p class="para">“What?”</p>
<p class="para">The man didn’t reply. He simply bore Ituralde on thundering hooves into the safety of the city—such as that safety was, considering the city was now besieged by a force of several hundred thousand Shadowspawn.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Morgase walked out of the camp. Nobody stopped her, though some did give her odd looks. She passed the wooded northern rim. The trees were burloak, spaced apart to allow for their great, spreading arms. She moved beneath the boughs, breathing deeply of the humid air.</p>
<p class="para">Gaebril had been one of the Forsaken.</p>
<p class="para">She eventually found a place where a tiny highland stream filled a cleft between two rocks and created a still, clear pool. The tall rocks around it clustered like an ancient, broken throne built for a giant fifteen spans tall.</p>
<p class="para">The trees bore leaves above, though many looked sickly. A thinner patch of clouds blew past, allowing fingers of sunlight to reach down from the overcast sky. That splintered light shone in rays through the clear water, making patches of light on the pool’s bottom. Minnows darted between the patches, as if investigating the light.</p>
<p class="para">Morgase rounded the pool, then settled atop a flat boulder. The sounds of the camp could be heard in the distance. Calling, posts being driven into the ground, carts rattling on pathways.</p>
<p class="para">She stared into the pool. Was there anything more hateful than being made the pawn of another? Of being forced to dance upon their strings like a wooden puppet? In her youth, she’d grown well acquainted with bowing before the whims of others. That had been the only way for her to stabilize her rule.</p>
<p class="para">Taringail had tried to manipulate her. In truth, he’d been successful much of the time. There had been others, too. So many who had pushed her this way or that. She’d spent ten years pandering to whichever faction was the strongest. Ten years slowly building alliances. It had worked. She’d eventually been able to maneuver on her own. When Taringail had died hunting, many had whispered that his passing released her, but those close to her had known that she had already gone a long way toward unseating his authority.</p>
<p class="para">She could remember the very day when she’d cast off the last of those who had presumed to be the real power behind the throne. That was the day that, in her heart, she’d truly become Queen. She’d sworn that she’d never let another manipulate her again.</p>
<p class="para">And then, years later, Gaebril had arrived. After that, Valda, who had been worse. At least with Gaebril, she hadn’t realized what was happening. That had numbed the wounds.</p>
<p class="para">Footsteps on fallen twigs announced a visitor. The light from above dimmed, the thinner clouds moving on. The shafts of light faded, and the minnows scattered.</p>
<p class="para">The footsteps stopped beside her stone. “I’m leaving,” Tallanvor’s voice said. “Aybara has given leave for his Asha’man to make gateways, starting with some of the distant cities. I’m going to Tear. Rumors say there’s a king there again. He’s gathering an army to fight in the Last Battle. I want to be with it.”</p>
<p class="para">Morgase looked up, staring ahead through the trees. It wasn’t really a forest. “They say you were as single-minded as Goldeneyes,” she said softly. “That you would not rest, that you barely took time to eat, that you spent every moment searching for a way to free me.”</p>
<p class="para">Tallanvor said nothing.</p>
<p class="para">“I’ve never had a man do that for me,” she continued. “Taringail saw me as a pawn, Thom as a beauty to be hunted and romanced, and Gareth as a queen to be served. But none of them made me their entire life, their heart. I think Thom and Gareth loved me, but as something to be held and cared for, then released. I didn’t think you’d ever let go.”</p>
<p class="para">“I won’t,” Tallanvor said softly.</p>
<p class="para">“You go to Tear. Yet you said you’d never leave.”</p>
<p class="para">“My heart stays here,” he said. “I know well what it is to love from afar, Morgase. I’d done it for years before this fool’s trip began, and I will do it for years yet. My heart is a traitor. Perhaps some Trolloc will do me a favor and rip it free of my chest.”</p>
<p class="para">“So bitter,” she whispered.</p>
<p class="para">“You have made it amply clear that my attentions are not wanted. A queen and a simple guardsman. Pure foolishness.”</p>
<p class="para">“A queen no longer,” she said.</p>
<p class="para">“Not in name, Morgase. Just in mind.”</p>
<p class="para">A leaf fell from above and struck the pool. With a lobed margin and verdant richness, it should have had a long life yet.</p>
<p class="para">“Do you know the worst part of this?” Tallanvor asked. “It’s the hope. The hope I let myself feel. Traveling with you, protecting you, I thought maybe you would see. Maybe you would care. And forget about <span class="italic1">him</span>.”</p>
<p class="para">“Him?”</p>
<p class="para">“Gaebril,” Tallanvor snapped. “I can see that you still think of him. Even after what he did to you. I leave my heart here, but you left yours in Caemlyn.” From the corner of her eye, she could see him turn away. “Whatever it is you saw in him, I don’t have it. I’m only a simple, common, <span class="italic1">idiot</span> of a Guardsman who can’t say the right words. You fawned over Gaebril, and he all but ignored you. That’s how love is. Bloody ashes, I’ve all but done the same thing with you.”</p>
<p class="para">She said nothing.</p>
<p class="para">“Well,” he said, “that’s why I have to go. You’re safe now, and that’s all that matters. Light help me, but that’s <span class="italic1">still</span> all that I care about!”</p>
<p class="para">He began to walk away, feet crunching twigs.</p>
<p class="para">“Gaebril was one of the Forsaken,” she said.</p>
<p class="para">The crunching twigs stopped.</p>
<p class="para">“He was really Rahvin,” she continued. “He took over Andor through use of the One Power, forcing people to do as he said.”</p>
<p class="para">Tallanvor hissed, twigs crunching as he hastened back to her. “Are you certain?”</p>
<p class="para">“Certain? No. But it <span class="italic1">does</span> make sense. We can’t ignore what is happening in the world, Tallanvor. The weather, the way food spoils in a heartbeat, the movements of this Rand al’Thor. He is no false Dragon. The Forsaken must be loose again.</p>
<p class="para">“What would you do, if you were one of them? Raise up an army and conquer? Or simply stroll into a palace and take the Queen as your consort? Twist her mind so that she lets you do as you wish. You’d gain the resources of an entire nation, all with minimal effort. Barely a finger raised…”</p>
<p class="para">She raised her head and stared off into the distance. Northward. Toward Andor. “They call it Compulsion. A dark, foul weave that removes the will from your subject. I’m not supposed to know that it exists.</p>
<p class="para">“You say that I think of him. That is true. I think about him and <span class="italic1">hate</span> him. Hate myself for what I let him do. And a part of my heart knows that if he were to appear here and demand something from me, I’d give it. I couldn’t help myself. But this thing I feel for him—this thing that blends my desire and my hatred like two locks in a braid—it is not love.”</p>
<p class="para">She turned and looked down at Tallanvor. “I know love, Tallanvor, and Gaebril never had it from me. I doubt that a creature like him could comprehend love.”</p>
<p class="para">Tallanvor met her eyes. His were dark gray, soft and pure. “Woman, you give me that monster hope again. Be wary of what lies at your feet.”</p>
<p class="para">“I need time to think. Would you refrain, for now, from going to Tear?”</p>
<p class="para">He bowed. “Morgase, if you want anything from me—<span class="italic1">anything</span>—all you ever need to do is ask. I thought I made that clear. I’ll remove my name from the list.”</p>
<p class="para">He withdrew. Morgase watched him, her mind a tempest despite the stillness of the trees and pond before her.</p>
