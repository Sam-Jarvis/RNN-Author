<p class="ct"><span class="epub-i">Not a Mistake to Ignore</span></p>
<p class="tni">Siuan rolled her shoulder. She grimaced at the sharp pain. “Yukiri,” she grumbled, “that weave of yours still needs work.”</p>
<p class="tx">The tiny Gray cursed softly, standing up from beside a soldier who had lost his hand. She hadn’t Healed him, instead leaving him to more mundane healers with bandages. To spend energy Healing this man would be a waste, as he would never fight again. They needed to save their strength for soldiers who could rejoin the battle.</p>
<p class="tx">It was brutal reasoning. Well, these were brutal times. Siuan and Yukiri moved on to the next soldier in the line of wounded. The man with the missing hand would survive without Healing. Probably. They had the Yellows in Mayene, but their energy was consumed in Healing Aes Sedai who had survived the escape and soldiers who could still fight.</p>
<p class="tx">All through the makeshift camp, set up on Arafellin soil east of the river’s ford, soldiers wept and groaned. So many wounded, and Siuan and Yukiri were among the few Aes Sedai left with any strength to Heal. Most of the others had drained themselves making gateways to bring their army out from between the two attacking forces.</p>
<p class="tx">The Sharans had attacked aggressively, but securing the White Tower’s camp had occupied them for a while, giving time for the army to flee. Pieces of it, at least.</p>
<p class="tx">Yukiri Delved the next man, then nodded. Siuan knelt down and began a Healing weave. She’d never been very good at this, and even with an <span class="epub-i1">angreal</span>, it took a lot out of her. She brought the soldier back from the edge of death, Healing the wound in his side. He gasped, much of the energy for the Healing coming from his own body.</p>
<p class="tx">Siuan wavered, then fell to her knees in exhaustion. Light, she was as unsteady as a noblewoman her first day on the deck of a ship!</p>
<p class="tx">Yukiri looked her over, then reached out for the <span class="epub-i1">angreal</span>, a small stone flower. “Go rest, Siuan.”</p>
<p class="tx">Siuan clenched her teeth, but handed over the <span class="epub-i1">angreal</span>. The One Power slipped from her, and she let out a deep sigh, half-relieved and half-saddened at losing the beauty of <span class="epub-i1">saidar</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">Yukiri moved to the next soldier. Siuan lay back where she was, her body complaining of its numerous bruises and aches. The events of the battle were a blur to her. She remembered young Gawyn Trakand bursting into the command tent, yelling that Egwene wanted the army to retreat.</p>
<p class="tx">Bryne had moved quickly, dropping a written order through the gateway in the floor. That was his newest method of passing commands—an arrow shaft with a note and a long ribbon tied to it, dropped through a gateway high above. There were no heads on the shafts, just a small stone to weight them.</p>
<p class="tx">Bryne had been restless before Gawyn appeared. He hadn’t liked the way the battle had been playing out. The way the Trollocs moved had warned him that the Shadow had been planning something. Siuan was certain he’d already prepared the orders.</p>
<p class="tx">Then there had been the explosions in camp. And Yukiri yelling for them to jump <span class="epub-i1">through</span> the hole in the floor. Light, she’d assumed the woman was mad! Mad enough to save all of their lives, apparently.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Burn me if I’m going to lie here like a piece of yesterday’s catch on the deck,</span> Siuan thought, staring up at the sky. She hauled herself to her feet and started stalking through the new camp.</p>
<p class="tx">Yukiri claimed her weave wasn’t all <span class="epub-i1">that</span> obscure, though Siuan had never heard of it. A massive cushion of Air, meant to cradle someone who had fallen a great distance. Crafting it had drawn the attention of the Sharans—<span class="epub-i1">Sharans</span>, of all things!—but they’d escaped. She, Bryne, Yukiri and a few aides. Burn her, they’d gotten out, though that fall still made her wince to remember. And Yukiri kept saying she thought the weave might be the secret behind discovering how to fly! Fool woman. There was a good reason the Creator hadn’t given people wings.</p>
<p class="tx">She found Bryne at the edge of the new camp, sitting exhausted on a stump. Two battle maps spread out by stones lay on the ground in front of him. The maps were wrinkled; he’d grabbed them as the tent started to explode around him.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Fool man,</span> she thought. <span class="epub-i1">Risking his life for a couple of pieces of paper.</span></p>
<p class="tx">“… from reports,” said General Haerm, the new commander of the Illianer Companions. “I’m sorry, my Lord. The scouts don’t dare sneak too close to the old camp.”</p>
<p class="tx">“No sign of the Amyrlin?” Siuan asked.</p>
<p class="tx">Bryne and Haerm both shook their heads.</p>
<p class="tx">“Keep looking, young man.” Siuan wagged a finger at Haerm. He raised an eyebrow at her use of the word “young.” Burn this youthful face she’d been given. “I mean it. The Amyrlin is alive. You <span class="epub-i1">find</span> her, you hear me?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I … Yes, Aes Sedai.” He showed some measure of respect, but not enough. These Illianers didn’t know how to treat Aes Sedai.</p>
<p class="tx">Bryne waved the man off, and for once, it didn’t look as if anyone was waiting to meet with him. Everyone was probably too exhausted. Their “camp” looked more like a collection of refugees from a terrible fire than it did an army. Most of the men had rolled themselves in cloaks and gone to sleep. Soldiers were better than sailors at sleeping whenever, and wherever, they could.</p>
<p class="tx">She couldn’t blame them. She’d been exhausted <span class="epub-i1">before</span> the Sharans arrived. Now she was tired as death itself. She sat down on the ground beside Bryne’s stump.</p>
<p class="tx">“Arm still hurting you?” Bryne asked, reaching down to rub her shoulder.</p>
<p class="tx">“You can feel that it is,” Siuan grumbled.</p>
<p class="tx">“Merely trying to be pleasant, Siuan.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Don’t think I have forgotten that you’re to blame for this bruise.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Me?” Bryne said, sounding amused.</p>
<p class="tx">“You pushed me through the hole.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You didn’t seem ready to move.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I was just about to jump. I was almost there.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m certain,” Bryne said.</p>
<p class="tx">“It’s your fault,” Siuan insisted. “I tumbled. I hadn’t intended to tumble. And Yukiri’s weave … horrible thing.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It worked,” Bryne said. “I doubt many people can claim to have fallen three hundred paces and survived.”</p>
<p class="tx">“She was too eager,” Siuan said. “She was probably longing to make us jump, you know. All that talk about Traveling and weaves of movement…” She trailed off, partly because she was annoyed at herself. This day had gone poorly enough without her griping at Bryne. “How many did we lose?” Not a much better topic, but she needed to know. “Do we have reports yet?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Nearly one in two of the soldiers,” Bryne said softly.</p>
<p class="tx">Worse than she’d suspected. “And the Aes Sedai?”</p>
<p class="tx">“We have somewhere around two hundred and fifty left,” Bryne said. “Though a number of those are in shock at having lost Warders.”</p>
<p class="tx">That was more of a disaster. A hundred and twenty Aes Sedai dead in a matter of hours? The White Tower would require a very long time to recover from that.</p>
<p class="tx">“I’m sorry, Siuan,” Bryne said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Bah,” Siuan said, “most of them treated me like fish guts anyway. They resented me as Amyrlin, laughed when I was cast down, and then made a servant of me when I returned.”</p>
<p class="tx">Bryne nodded, still rubbing her shoulder. He could feel that she was hurt, despite her words. There were good women among the dead. Many good sisters.</p>
<p class="tx">“She’s out there,” Siuan said stubbornly. “Egwene will surprise us, Bryne. You watch.”</p>
<p class="tx">“If I’m watching, it won’t be much of a surprise, will it?”</p>
<p class="tx">Siuan grunted. “Fool man.”</p>
<p class="tx">“You’re right,” he said solemnly. “On both counts. I think Egwene <span class="epub-i1">will</span> surprise us. I’m also a fool.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Bryne…”</p>
<p class="tx">“I <span class="epub-i1">am</span>, Siuan. How could I miss that they were stalling? They wanted to occupy us until this other force could gather. The Trollocs pulled back into those hills. A defensive move. Trollocs aren’t defensive. I assumed they were trying to set up an ambush only, and that was why they were pulling back corpses and preparing to wait. If I’d attacked them earlier, this could have been avoided. I was too careful.”</p>
<p class="tx">“A man who thinks all day about the catch he missed because of stormy weather ends up wasting time when the sky is clear.”</p>
<p class="tx">“A clever proverb, Siuan,” he said. “But there’s a saying among generals, written by Fogh the Tireless. ‘If you do not learn from your losses, you will be ruled by them.’ I can’t see how I let this happen. I’ve trained better than this, prepared better than this! It’s <span class="epub-i1">not</span> just a mistake I can ignore, Siuan. The Pattern itself is at stake.”</p>
<p class="tx">He rubbed his forehead. In the dim light of the setting sun, he looked older, his face wrinkled, his hands frail. It was as if this battle had stolen decades from him. He sighed, hunching forward.</p>
<p class="tx">Siuan found herself at a loss for words.</p>
<p class="tx">They sat in silence.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Lyrelle waited outside the gates to the so-called Black Tower. It took every ounce of her training not to let her frustration show.</p>
<p class="tx">This entire expedition had been a disaster from the start. First, the Black Tower had refused them entry until the Reds had done their business, and that had been followed by the trouble with gateways. <span class="epub-i1">That</span> had been followed by three bubbles of evil, two attempts by Darkfriends to murder the lot of them and the warning from the Amyrlin that the Black Tower had joined the Shadow to fight.</p>
<p class="tx">Lyrelle had sent most of her women to fight alongside Lan Mandragoran at the Amyrlin’s insistence. She’d remained behind with a few sisters to watch the Black Tower. And now … now this. What to make of it?</p>
<p class="tx">“I can assure you,” the young Asha’man said, “the danger has passed. We drove off the M’Hael and the others who turned to the Shadow. The rest of us walk in the Light.”</p>
<p class="tx">Lyrelle turned to her companions. A representative from each Ajah, along with backup—sent for desperately this morning when the Asha’man had first approached her—in the form of thirty other sisters. They accepted Lyrelle’s leadership here, if only reluctantly.</p>
<p class="tx">“We will discuss it,” she said, dismissing the young Asha’man with a nod.</p>
<p class="tx">“What do we do?” Myrelle asked. The Green had been with Lyrelle from the start, one of the few that she’d not sent away, partially because she wanted the woman’s Warders near. “If some of their members are fighting for the Shadow…”</p>
<p class="tx">“Gateways can be made again,” Seaine said. “Something has changed about this place in the days since we felt that channeling inside.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I don’t trust it,” Myrelle said.</p>
<p class="tx">“We must know for certain,” Seaine said. “We cannot leave the Black Tower unattended during the Last Battle itself. We <span class="epub-i1">must</span> see these men taken care of, one way or another.” The Black Tower men claimed that only a few of their number had joined the Shadow, and that the channeling had been the result of an attack by the Black Ajah.</p>
<p class="tx">It galled her to hear them use those words. Black Ajah. For centuries, the White Tower had denied the existence of Darkfriends among Aes Sedai. The truth had, unfortunately, been revealed. That didn’t mean Lyrelle wanted to hear men tossing around the term so casually. Particularly men like these.</p>
<p class="tx">“If they’d wanted to attack us,” Lyrelle said speculatively, “they’d have done it when we couldn’t escape with gateways. For now, I will assume they have cleansed the … problems among their ranks. As was required of the White Tower itself.”</p>
<p class="tx">“So we go in?” Myrelle asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes. We bond the men we were promised, and from them draw out the truth, if it is obscured.” It troubled Lyrelle that the Dragon Reborn had refused them the highest-ranking among the Asha’man, but Lyrelle had devised a plan when she first came here. It should still work. She would first ask for a display of channeling among the men, and would bond the one she felt was strongest. She would then have that one tell her which among the trainees were the most talented so her sisters could bond those.</p>
<p class="tx">From there … well, she hoped that would contain the majority of these men. Light, what a mess. Men who could <span class="epub-i1">channel</span>, walking about unashamed! She did not accept this fable of the taint having been cleansed. Of course these … men … would claim such a thing.</p>
<p class="tx">“Sometimes,” Lyrelle muttered, “I wish I could go back and slap myself for accepting this commission.”</p>
<p class="tx">Myrelle laughed. She never <span class="epub-i1">did</span> take events as seriously as she should. Lyrelle felt annoyed at having missed the chances to be had at the White Tower during her long absence. Reunification, fighting the Seanchan … These were the times when leadership could be proven, and a woman could gain a reputation for strength.</p>
<p class="tx">Opportunities appeared during times of upheaval. Opportunities now lost to her. Light, but she hated that thought.</p>
<p class="tx">“We will enter,” she called up to the walls framing the gate before her. Then, more softly, she continued to her women: “Hold the One Power and be careful. We do not know what could happen here.” Her women would be a match for a larger number of untrained Asha’man, if it came to that. It shouldn’t, logically. Of course, the men <span class="epub-i1">were</span> likely mad. So perhaps assuming logic from them was imprudent.</p>
<p class="tx">The large gates opened to allow her people in. It said something about these Black Tower men that they chose to finish the walls around their grounds before actually building their tower.</p>
<p class="tx">She kneed her horse forward, and Myrelle and the others followed in a clopping of hooves. Lyrelle embraced the Source and used the new weave, which would tell her if a man channeled nearby. It was not the young man from a short time ago who met them at the gates, however.</p>
<p class="tx">“What is this?” Lyrelle asked as she was joined by Pevara Tazanovni. Lyrelle knew the Red Sitter, though not well.</p>
<p class="tx">“I’ve been asked to accompany you,” Pevara said cheerfully. “Logain thought that a familiar face might make you more comfortable.”</p>
<p class="tx">Lyrelle held in a sneer. Aes Sedai should not be cheerful. Aes Sedai should be calm, collected, and—if anything else—stern. A man should look at an Aes Sedai and immediately wonder what he had done wrong and how he could fix it.</p>
<p class="tx">Pevara fell in beside her as they rode onto the grounds of the Black Tower. “Logain, who is in charge now, sends his regards,” Pevara continued. “He was gravely wounded in the attacks and has not yet fully recovered.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Will he be well?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Oh, certainly. He should be up and about in another day or two. He will be needed to lead the Asha’man as they join the Last Battle, I suspect.”</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Pity,</span> Lyrelle thought. The Black Tower would have been more easily controlled without a false Dragon at their head. Better that he had died.</p>
<p class="tx">“I am certain his aid will be useful,” Lyrelle said. “His leadership, however … Well, we shall see. Tell me, Pevara. I have been told that bonding a man who can channel is different from bonding a normal man. Have you been through the process?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes,” Pevara said.</p>
<p class="tx">“Is it true, then?” Lyrelle asked. “Ordinary men can be compelled with the bond to obey, but not these Asha’man?”</p>
<p class="tx">Pevara smiled, seeming wistful. “Ah, what would that be like? No, the bond cannot force Asha’man. You will have to use more inventive means.”</p>
<p class="tx">That was not good. “How obedient are they?” Aledrin asked from the other side.</p>
<p class="tx">“It depends on the man, I suspect,” Pevara said.</p>
<p class="tx">“If they cannot be forced,” Lyrelle said, “will they obey their Aes Sedai in battle?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Probably,” Pevara said, though there was something ambiguous about the way she said it. “I must tell you something, all of you. The mission I was sent on, and the one you also pursue, is a fool’s errand.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Is that so?” Lyrelle asked evenly. She was hardly going to trust a Red after what they had done to Siuan. “Why is that?”</p>
<p class="tx">“I was once where you are,” Pevara said. “Ready to bond all of the Asha’man in an attempt to control them. But would you ride into another city and select fifty men there, at a whim, and bond them as Warders? Bonding the Asha’man just to bond them is foolish. It will not control them. I do think some Asha’man will make excellent Warders, but—like many men—others will not. I suggest that you abandon your plan to bond exactly forty-seven and take those who are most willing. You will gain better Warders.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Interesting advice,” Lyrelle said. “But, as you mentioned, the Asha’man will be needed at the battlefront. There is not time. We will take the forty-seven most powerful.”</p>
<p class="tx">Pevara sighed, but said nothing further as they passed several men in black coats with two pins on the high collars. Lyrelle felt her skin crawling, as if insects burrowed beneath it. Men who could channel.</p>
<p class="tx">Lelaine felt that the Black Tower was vital to the White Tower’s plans. Well, Lyrelle did not belong to Lelaine. She was her own person, and a Sitter in her own right. If she could find a way to bring the Black Tower under her direct authority, then perhaps she could finally wiggle out from under Lelaine’s thumb.</p>
<p class="tx">For that prize, bonding Asha’man was worthwhile. Light, but she wasn’t going to enjoy it. They needed all of these men controlled, somehow. The Dragon would be growing mad, unreliable by this point, tainted by the Dark One’s touch on <span class="epub-i1">saidin</span>. Could he be manipulated into letting the rest of the men be bonded?</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">Not having control through the bond</span> … <span class="epub-i1">that will be dangerous.</span> She imagined going into battle with ranks of two or three dozen Asha’man, bonded and forced to her will. How could she make it happen?</p>
<p class="tx">They reached a line of men in black coats waiting at the edge of the village. Lyrelle and the others approached them, and Lyrelle did a quick count. Forty-seven men, including the one standing at the front. What trick were they trying to pull?</p>
<p class="tx">The one at the front came forward. He was a sturdy man in his middle years, and he looked as if he’d recently suffered some kind of ordeal. He had bags under his eyes and wan skin. His step was firm, however, and his gaze steady as he met Lyrelle’s eyes, then bowed to her.</p>
<p class="tx">“Welcome, Aes Sedai,” he said.</p>
<p class="tx">“And you are?”</p>
<p class="tx">“Androl Genhald,” he said. “I’ve been put in charge of your forty-seven until they have been bonded.”</p>
<p class="tx">“<span class="epub-i1">My</span> forty-seven? I see that you have forgotten the terms already. We are to be given any soldier or Dedicated we wish, and they cannot refuse us.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Yes, indeed,” Androl said. “That is true. Unfortunately, all of the men in the Black Tower other than these are either full Asha’man, or have been called away on urgent business. The others would, of course, follow the Dragon’s commands if they were here. We made certain to keep forty-seven for you. Actually, forty-six. I’ve already been bonded by Pevara Sedai, you see.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We will wait until the others return,” Lyrelle said coldly.</p>
<p class="tx">“Alas,” Androl said, “I do not think they will return any time soon. If you intend to join the Last Battle, you will have to make your selections quickly.”</p>
<p class="tx">Lyrelle narrowed her eyes at him, then looked at Pevara, who shrugged.</p>
<p class="tx">“This is a trick,” Lyrelle said to Androl. “And a childish one.”</p>
<p class="tx">“I thought it clever myself,” Androl returned, voice cool. “Worthy of an Aes Sedai, one might say. You were promised that any member of the Black Tower, save full Asha’man, would respond to your request. They will. Any of them to whom you can <span class="epub-i1">make</span> the request.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Undoubtedly, you chose for me the weakest among your numbers.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Actually,” Androl said, “we took those who volunteered. They are good men, every one of them. They are the ones who wanted to be Warders.”</p>
<p class="tx">“The Dragon Reborn will hear of this.”</p>
<p class="tx">“From what I’ve heard,” Androl said, “he’s heading to Shayol Ghul any time now. Are you going to join him there just to make your complaint?”</p>
<p class="tx">Lyrelle drew her lips into a line.</p>
<p class="tx">“Here’s the thing, Aes Sedai,” Androl said. “The Dragon Reborn sent a message to us, just earlier today. He instructed us to learn one last lesson: that we’re not to think of ourselves as weapons, but as men. Well, men have a choice in their fate, and weapons do not. Here are your <span class="epub-i1">men</span>, Aes Sedai. Respect them.”</p>
<p class="tx">Androl bowed again and walked away. Pevara hesitated, then turned her horse, following him. Lyrelle saw something in the woman’s face as she looked at the man.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="epub-i1">So that is it,</span> Lyrelle thought. <span class="epub-i1">No better than a Green, that one is. I would have expected more of one her age.</span></p>
<p class="tx">Lyrelle was tempted to refuse this manipulation, to go to the Amyrlin and protest what had happened. Only … news from the Amyrlin’s battlefront was jumbled. Something about an unexpected army appearing; details were not available.</p>
<p class="tx">Certainly the Amyrlin would not be happy to hear complaints at this point. And certainly, Lyrelle admitted to herself, she also wanted to be done with the Black Tower.</p>
<p class="tx">“Each of you pick two,” Lyrelle said to her companions. “A few of us will take only one. Faolain and Theodrin, you are among those. Be quick about it, all of you. I want away from this place as soon as possible.”</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Pevara caught up to Androl as he slipped into one of the huts.</p>
<p class="tx">“Light,” she said. “I’d forgotten how <span class="epub-i1">cold</span> some of us can be.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Oh, I don’t know,” Androl replied. “I’ve heard that some of you aren’t quite so bad.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Be careful of them, Androl,” she said, looking back out. “Many will see you as only a threat or a tool to be used.”</p>
<p class="tx">“We won you over,” Androl said, walking into a room where Canler, Jonneth and Emarin waited with cups of warm tea. All three were beginning to recover from the fighting, Jonneth most quickly. Emarin bore the worst scars, most of them emotional. He, like Logain, had been subjected to the Turning process. Pevara noticed him staring blankly, sometimes, face etched by fear as if remembering something horrible.</p>
<p class="tx">“You three shouldn’t be here,” Pevara said, hands on hips, facing Emarin and the other two. “I know Logain promised you advancement, but you still wear only the sword on your collars. If any of those women saw you, they could take you as Warders.”</p>
<p class="tx">“They won’t see us,” Jonneth said with a laugh. “Androl would have us through a gateway before we had time to curse!”</p>
<p class="tx">“So what do we do now?” Canler asked.</p>
<p class="tx">“Whatever Logain wishes of us,” Androl said.</p>
<p class="tx">Logain had … changed since the ordeal. Androl whispered to her that he was darker now. He spoke less. He did still seem determined to get to the Last Battle, but for now, he gathered the men in and pored over things they’d found in Taim’s rooms. Pevara worried that the Turning had broken him inside.</p>
<p class="tx">“He thinks there might be something in those battle maps he found in Taim’s chambers,” Emarin said.</p>
<p class="tx">“We’ll go where Logain decides we can be of most use,” Androl replied. A straightforward answer, but one that didn’t actually say much.</p>
<p class="tx">“And what of the Lord Dragon?” Pevara asked carefully.</p>
<p class="tx">She felt Androl’s uncertainty. The Asha’man Naeff had come to them, bearing news and instructions—and with them, some implications. The Dragon Reborn had known all was not well at the Black Tower.</p>
<p class="tx">“He left us alone on purpose,” Androl said.</p>
<p class="tx">“He would have come if he could have!” Jonneth said. “I promise you.”</p>
<p class="tx">“He left us to escape on our own,” Emarin said, “or to fall on our own. He has become a harsh man. Perhaps callous.”</p>
<p class="tx">“It doesn’t matter,” Androl said. “The Black Tower has learned to survive without him. Light! It always survived without him. He barely had anything to do with us. It was Logain who gave us hope. It is Logain who will have my allegiance.”</p>
<p class="tx">The others nodded. Pevara felt something important happening here. <span class="epub-i1">They couldn’t have leaned upon him forever anyway,</span> she thought. <span class="epub-i1">The Dragon Reborn will die at the Last Battle.</span> By intention or not, he had given them the chance to become their own men.</p>
<p class="tx">“I will take his last order to heart, however,” Androl said. “I will not be merely a weapon. The taint is cleansed. We fight not to die, but to live. We have a <span class="epub-i1">reason</span> to live. Spread the word among the other men, and let us take oaths to uphold Logain as our leader. And then, to the Last Battle. Not as minions of the Dragon Reborn, not as pawns of the Amyrlin Seat, but as the Black Tower. Our own men.”</p>
<p class="tx">“Our own men,” the other three whispered, nodding.</p>
