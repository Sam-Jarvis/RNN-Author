<p class="para1"><strong class="calibre14">A Note on Dates in This Glossary.</strong> Three systems of recording dates have been in general use since the Breaking of the World. The first recorded years After the Breaking (AB). Since the years of the Breaking and immediately after were years of almost total chaos, and since this calendar was adopted a good hundred years after the end of the Breaking, its starting point was arbitrarily assigned. At the end of the Trolloc Wars many records had been lost, so much so that there was argument about the exact year under the old system. A new calendar was therefore established, dating from the end of the Wars and celebrating the supposed freedom of the world from the Trolloc threat. This second calendar recorded each year as Free Year (FY). After the disruption, death, and destruction caused by the War of the Hundred Years, a third calendar came into being. This calendar, of the New Era (NE), is currently in use.</p>

Since the Time of Madness, all surviving Aes Sedai are women. Widely distrusted and <a id="page_636" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>feared, even hated, they are blamed by many for the Breaking of the World, and are thought to meddle in the affairs of nations. At the same time, few rulers will be without an Aes Sedai advisor, even in lands where the existence of such a connection must be kept secret. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> <a href="part0147.html#fn3" class="toc_entry_chapter">Ajah</a>; <a href="part0147.html#fn4" class="toc_entry_chapter">Amyrlin Seat</a>; <a href="part0147.html#fn5" class="toc_entry_chapter">Time of Madness</a>.</p>

<p class="hangindent-para1"><strong class="calibre14">Age of Legends:</strong> The Age ended by the War of the Shadow and the Breaking of the World. A time when Aes Sedai performed wonders now only dreamed of. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> <a href="part0147.html#fn6" class="toc_entry_chapter">Wheel of Time</a>; <a href="part0147.html#fn7" class="toc_entry_chapter">Breaking of the World</a>; <a href="part0147.html#fn8" class="toc_entry_chapter">War of the Shadow</a>.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para1"><a id="fn25" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14">Aiel</strong> (eye-EEL): The people of the Aiel Waste. Fierce and hardy. Also called Aielmen. They veil their faces before they kill, giving rise to the saying “acting like a black-veiled Aiel” to describe someone who is being violent. Deadly warriors with weapons or with nothing but their bare hands, they will not touch a sword. Their pipers play them into battle with the music of dances, and Aielmen call battle “the Dance.” <em class="calibre4">See also</em> <a href="part0147.html#fn9" class="toc_entry_chapter">Aiel warrior societies</a>; <a href="part0147.html#fn10" class="toc_entry_chapter">Aiel Waste</a>.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para1"><a id="fn9" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14">Aiel warrior societies:</strong> Aiel warriors are all members of one of the warrior societies, such as the Stone Dogs, the Red Shields, or the Maidens of the Spear. Each society has its own customs, and sometimes specific duties. For example, Red Shields act as police. Stone Dogs often vow not to retreat once battle has been joined, and will die to the last man if necessary to fulfill this vow. The clans of the Aiel frequently fight among themselves, but members of the same society will not fight one another even if their clans are doing so. In this way, there are always lines of contact between the clans even when they are in open warfare. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> <a href="part0147.html#fn25" class="toc_entry_chapter">Aiel</a>; <a href="part0147.html#fn10" class="toc_entry_chapter">Aiel Waste</a>; <em class="calibre4"><a href="part0147.html#fn11" class="toc_entry_chapter">Far Dareis Mai</a>.</em></p>
<p class="hangindent-para1"><a id="fn10" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14">Aiel Waste:</strong> The harsh, rugged, and all-but-waterless land east of the Spine of the World. Few outsiders venture there, not only because water is almost impossible to find for one not born there, but because the Aiel consider themselves at war with all other peoples and do not welcome strangers.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para1"><a id="fn3" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14">Ajah</strong> (AH-jah): Societies among the Aes Sedai to which all Aes Sedai except the Amyrlin Seat belong. They are designated by colors: Blue, Red, White, Green, Brown, Yellow, and Gray. Each follows a specific philosophy of the use of the One Power and the purposes of the Aes Sedai. For example, the Red Ajah bends all its energies to finding men who are attempting to wield the Power and to gentling them. The <a id="page_637" class="toc_entry_chapter"/>Brown Ajah, on the other hand, forsakes involvement with the mundane world and dedicates itself to seeking knowledge. There are rumors (hotly denied, and never safely mentioned in front of any Aes Sedai) of a Black Ajah, dedicated to serving the Dark One.</p>

Elected for life by the Hall of the Tower, the highest council of the Aes Sedai, which consists of three representatives (called Sitters) from each of the seven Ajahs.

They caused great earthquakes, leveled old mountain ranges and raised new mountains, lifted dry land where seas had been and made the ocean rush in where dry land had been. Many parts of the world were completely depopulated, and the survivors were scattered like dust on the wind. This destruction is remembered in stories, legends, and history as the Breaking of the World. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> <a href="part0147.html#fn5" class="toc_entry_chapter">Time of Madness</a>.</p>

Founded during the War of the Hundred Years by Lothair Mantelar (LOH-thayr MAHN-tee-LAHR) to proselytize against the increasing numbers of Darkfriends, they evolved during the war into a completely military organization, extremely rigid in their beliefs, and completely certain that only they know the truth and the right. They hate Aes Sedai, considering them, and any who support or befriend them, Darkfriends. They are known disparagingly as Whitecloaks. Their sign is a golden sunburst on a field of white.</p>

The source of evil, antithesis of the Creator. Imprisoned by the Creator at the moment of Creation in a prison at Shayol Ghul. An attempt to free him from that prison brought about the War of the Shadow, the tainting of <em class="calibre4">saidin</em>, the Breaking of the World, and the end of the Age of Legends.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para1"><strong class="calibre14">Dark One, naming the:</strong> Saying the true name of the Dark One (Shai’tan) draws his attention, inevitably bringing ill fortune at best, disaster at worst. For that reason, many euphemisms are used, among them the Dark One, Father of Lies, Sightblinder, Lord of the Grave, Shepherd of the Night, Heartsbane, Heartfang, Grassburner, and Leafblighter. Someone who seems to be inviting ill fortune is often said to be “naming the Dark One.”</p>

A Draghkar appears to be a large man with bat-like wings, whose skin is too pale and whose eyes are too large. The Draghkar’s song can draw its prey to it, suppressing the victim’s will. There is a saying: “The kiss of the Draghkar is death.” It does not bite, but its kiss will consume first the soul of its victim, and then its life.</p>

Some have begun wars that involved many nations. Over the centuries most of these have been men unable to channel the One Power, but a few could do so. All, however, either disappeared or were captured or killed without fulfilling any of the Prophecies concerning the Rebirth of the Dragon. These men are called false Dragons. Among those who could channel, the most powerful were Raolin Darksbane (335–36AB), Yurian Stonebow (circa 1300–1308 AB), Davian (FY 351), Guaire Amalasan (FY 939–43), and Logain (997 NE). <em class="calibre4">See also</em> <a href="part0147.html#fn29" class="toc_entry_chapter">Dragon Reborn</a>.</p>

A Maiden may not marry and remain in the society, nor may she fight while carrying a child. Any child born to a Maiden is given to another woman to raise, in such a way that no one knows who the child’s mother was. (“You may belong to no man, nor may any man belong to you, nor any child. The spear is your lover, your child, and your life.”) These children are treasured, for it is prophesied that a child born of a Maiden will unite the clans and return the Aiel to the greatness they knew during the Age of Legends. <em class="calibre4">See also</em> <a href="part0147.html#fn25" class="toc_entry_chapter">Aiel</a>; <a href="part0147.html#fn9" class="toc_entry_chapter">Aiel warrior societies</a>.</p>
<p class="hangindent-para1"><a id="fn56" class="toc_entry_chapter"/><strong class="calibre14">Five Powers, the:</strong> There are threads to the One Power, and each person who can channel can usually grasp some threads better than others. These threads are named according to the sorts of things that can be done using them—Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and Spirit—and are called the Five Powers. Any wielder of the Power will have a greater degree of strength with one, or possibly two, of these, and lesser strength in the others. Some few may have great strength with three, but since the Age of Legends no one has had great strength with all five. Even then this was extremely rare. The degree of strength can vary greatly between individuals, so that some who can channel are much stronger than others. Performing certain acts with the One Power requires ability in one or more of the Five Powers. For example, starting or controlling a fire requires Fire, and affecting the weather requires Air and Water, while Healing requires Water and Spirit. While Spirit was found equally in men and in women, great ability with Earth and/or Fire was found much more often among men; with Water and/or Air among women. There were exceptions, but it was so often so that Earth and Fire came to be regarded as male Powers, Air and Water as female. Generally, no ability is considered stronger than any other, though there is a saying among Aes Sedai: “There is no rock so strong that water and wind cannot wear it away, no fire so fierce that water cannot quench it or wind snuff it out.” It should be noted this saying came into use long after the last male Aes Sedai was dead. Any equivalent saying among male Aes Sedai is long lost.</p>
