<div class="subtitle-chapter"><span class="calibre2"><span class="calibre18">Whirlpools in the Pattern</span></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre2">I</span>nland the hot night wind blew, north across the vast delta called the Fingers of the Dragon, a winding maze of waterways broad and narrow, some choked with knifegrass. Vast plains of reeds separated clusters of low islands forested with spider-rooted trees seen nowhere else. Eventually the delta gave way to its source, the River Erinin, the river’s great width spotted with the lights of small boats lantern-fishing. Boats and lights bobbed wildly, sudden and unexpected, and some older men muttered of evil things passing in the night. Young men laughed, but they hauled the nets more vigorously, too, eager to be home and out of the dark. The stories said evil could not cross your threshold unless you invited it in. That was what the stories said. But out in the darkness . . . .</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The last tang of salt had vanished by the time the wind reached the great city of Tear, hard by the river, where tile-roofed inns and shops shouldered against tall, towered palaces gleaming in the moonlight. Yet no place was half so tall as the massive bulk, almost a mountain, that stretched from city’s heart to water’s edge. The Stone of Tear, fortress of legend, the oldest stronghold of mankind, erected in the last days of the Breaking of the World. While nations and empires rose and fell, were replaced and fell anew, the Stone stood. It was the rock on which armies had broken spears and swords and hearts for three thousand years. And in all that time it had never fallen to invading arms. Until now.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The streets of the city, the taverns and inns, were all but empty in the muggy darkness, people keeping cautiously within their own walls. Who held the Stone was lord of Tear, city and nation. That was the way it had always been, and the people of Tear accepted it always. By daylight they would cheer their new lord with enthusiasm as they had cheered the old; by night they huddled together, shivering despite the heat when the wind howled across their rooftops like a thousand keening mourners. Strange new hopes danced in their heads, hopes none in Tear had dared for a hundred generations, hopes mixed with fears as old as the Breaking.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The wind lashed the long, white banner catching the moon above the Stone as if trying to rip it away. Along its length marched a sinuous figure like a legged serpent, golden-maned like a lion, scaled in scarlet and gold, seeming to ride the wind. Banner of prophecy, hoped for and dreaded. Banner of the Dragon. The Dragon Reborn. Harbinger of the world’s salvation, and herald of a new Breaking to come. As if outraged at such defiance, the wind dashed itself against the hard walls of the Stone. The Dragon banner floated, unheeding in the night, awaiting greater storms.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">In a room more than halfway up the Stone’s southern face, Perrin sat on the chest at the foot of his canopied bed and watched the dark-haired young woman pacing up and down. There was a trace of wariness in his golden eyes. Usually Faile bantered with him, maybe poked a little gentle fun at his deliberate ways; tonight she had not said ten words since coming through the door. He could smell the rose petals that had been folded into her clothes after cleaning, and the scent that was just her. And in the hint of clean perspiration, he smelled nervousness. Faile almost never showed nerves. Wondering why she did now set an itch between his shoulders that had nothing to do with the night’s heat. Her narrow, divided skirts made a soft <span class="calibre18">whisk-whisk-whisk</span> with her strides.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He scratched his two-week growth of beard irritably. It was even curlier than the hair on his head. It was also hot. For the hundredth time he thought of shaving.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It suits you,” Faile said suddenly, stopping in her tracks.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Uncomfortably, he shrugged shoulders heavy from long hours working at a forge. She did that sometimes, seemed to know what he was thinking. “It itches,” he muttered, and wished he had spoken more forcefully. It was his beard; he could shave it off any time he wanted.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She studied him, her head tilted to one side. Her bold nose and high cheekbones made it seem a fierce study, a contrast to the soft voice in which she said, “It looks right on you.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin sighed, and shrugged again. She had not asked him to keep the beard, and she would not. Yet he knew he was going to put off shaving again. He wondered how his friend Mat would handle this situation. Probably with a pinch and a kiss and some remark that made her laugh until he brought her around to his way of thinking. But Perrin knew he did not have Mat’s way with the girls. Mat would never find himself sweating behind a beard just because a woman thought he should have hair on his face. Unless, maybe, the woman was Faile. Perrin suspected that her father must deeply regret her leaving home, and not just because she was his daughter. He was the biggest fur trader in Saldaea, so she claimed, and Perrin could see her getting the price she wanted every time.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Something is troubling you, Faile, and it isn’t my beard. What is it?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Her expression became guarded. She looked everywhere but at him, making a contemptuous survey of the room’s furnishings.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Carvings of leopards and lions, stooping hawks and hunting scenes decorated everything from the tall wardrobe and bedposts as thick as his leg to the padded bench in front of the cold marble fireplace. Some of the animals had garnet eyes.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He had tried to convince the majhere that he wanted a simple room, but she did not seem to understand. Not that she was stupid or slow. The majhere commanded an army of servants greater in numbers than the Defenders of the Stone; whoever commanded the Stone, whoever held its walls, she saw to the day-to-day matters that let everything function. But she looked at the world through Tairen eyes. Despite his clothes, he must be more than the young countryman he seemed, because commoners were never housed in the Stone—save for Defenders and servants, of course. Beyond that, he was one of Rand’s party, a friend or a follower or in any case close to the Dragon Reborn in some way. To the majhere, that set him on a level with a Lord of the Land at the very least, if not a High Lord. She had been scandalized enough at putting him in here, without even a sitting room; he thought she might have fainted if he had insisted on an even plainer chamber. If there were such things short of the servants’ quarters, or the Defenders’. At least nothing here was gilded except the candlesticks.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Faile’s opinions, though, were not his. “You should have better than this. You deserve it. You can wager your last copper that Mat has better.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Mat likes gaudy things,” he said simply.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You do not stand up for yourself.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He did not comment. It was not his rooms that made her smell of unease, any more than his beard.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">After a moment, she said, “The Lord Dragon seems to have lost interest in you. All his time is taken by the High Lords, now.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The itch between his shoulders worsened; he knew what was troubling her now. He tried to make his voice light. “The Lord Dragon? You sound like a Tairen. His name is Rand.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He’s your friend, Perrin Aybara, not mine. If a man like that has friends.” She drew a deep breath and went on in a more moderate tone. “I have been thinking about leaving the Stone. Leaving Tear. I don’t think Moiraine would try to stop me. News of . . . of Rand has been leaving the city for two weeks, now. She can’t think to keep him secret any longer.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He only just stopped another sigh. “I don’t think she will, either. If anything, I think she considers you a complication. She will probably give you money to see you on your way.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Planting fists on hips, she moved to stare down at him. “Is that all you have to say?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What do you want me to say? That I want you to stay?” The anger in his own voice startled him. He was angry with himself, not her. Angry because he had not seen this coming, angry because he could not see how to deal with it. He liked being able to think things through. It was easy to hurt people without meaning to when you were hasty. He’d done that now. Her dark eyes were large with shock. He tried to smooth his words. “I do want you to stay, Faile, but maybe you should leave. I know you’re no coward, but the Dragon Reborn, the Forsaken . . . .” Not that anywhere was really safe—not for long, not now—yet there were safer places than the Stone. For a while, anyway. Not that he was stupid enough to put it to her that way.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">But she did not appear to care how he put it. “Stay? The Light illumine me! Anything is better than sitting here like a boulder, but . . . .” She knelt gracefully in front of him, resting her hands on his knees. “Perrin. I do not like wondering when one of the Forsaken is going to walk around the corner in front of me, and I do not like wondering when the Dragon Reborn is going to kill us all. He did it back in the Breaking, after all. Killed everyone close to him.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Rand isn’t Lews Therin Kinslayer,” Perrin protested. “I mean, he <span class="calibre18">is</span> the Dragon Reborn, but he isn’t . . . he wouldn’t . . . .” He trailed off, not knowing how to finish. Rand was Lews Therin Telamon reborn; that was what being the Dragon Reborn meant. But did it mean Rand was doomed to Lews Therin’s fate? Not just going mad—any man who channeled had that fate in front of him, and then a rotting death—but killing everyone who cared for him?</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I have been talking to Bain and Chiad, Perrin.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">That was no surprise. She spent considerable time with the Aiel women. The friendship made some trouble for her, but she seemed to like the Aiel women as much as she despised the Stone’s Tairen noblewomen. But he saw no connection to what they were talking about, and he said so.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“They say Moiraine sometimes asks where you are. Or Mat. Don’t you see? She would not have to do that if she could watch you with the Power.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Watch me with the Power?” he said faintly. He had never even considered that.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“She cannot. Come with me, Perrin. We can be twenty miles across the river before she misses us.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I can’t,” he said miserably. He tried diverting her with a kiss, but she leaped to her feet and backed away so fast he nearly fell on his face. There was no point going after her. She had her arms crossed beneath her breasts like a barrier.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Don’t tell me you are that afraid of her. I know she is Aes Sedai, and she has all of you dancing when she twitches the strings. Perhaps she has the . . . Rand . . . so tied he cannot get loose, and the Light knows Egwene and Elayne, and even Nynaeve, don’t want to, but you can break her cords if you try.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It has nothing to do with Moiraine. It’s what I have to do. I—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She cut him short. “Don’t you dare hand me any of that hairy-chested drivel about a man having to do his duty. I know duty as well as you, and you have no duty here. You may be <span class="calibre18">ta’veren</span>, even if I don’t see it, but he is the Dragon Reborn, not you.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Will you listen?” he shouted, glaring, and she jumped. He had never shouted at her before, not like that. She raised her chin and shifted her shoulders, but she did not say anything. He went on. “I think I am part of Rand’s destiny, somehow. Mat, too. I think he can’t do what he has to unless we do our part, as well. That is the duty. How can I walk away if it might mean Rand will fail?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Might?” There was a hint of demand in her voice, but only a hint. He wondered if he could make himself shout at her more often. “Did Moiraine tell you this, Perrin? You should know by now to listen closely to what an Aes Sedai says.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I worked it out for myself. I think <span class="calibre18">ta’veren</span> are pulled toward each other. Or maybe Rand pulls us, Mat and me both. He’s supposed to be the strongest <span class="calibre18">ta’veren</span> since Artur Hawkwing, maybe since the Breaking. Mat won’t even admit he’s <span class="calibre18">ta’veren</span>, but however he tries to get away, he always
ends up drawn back to Rand. Loial says he has never heard of three <span class="calibre18">ta’veren</span>, all the same age and all from the same place.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Faile sniffed loudly. “Loial does not know everything. He isn’t very old for an Ogier.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“He’s past ninety,” Perrin said defensively, and she gave him a tight smile. For an Ogier, ninety years was not much older than Perrin. Or maybe younger. He did not know much about Ogier. In any case, Loial had read more books than Perrin had ever seen or even heard of; sometimes he thought Loial had read every book ever printed. “And he knows more than you or I do. He believes maybe I have the right of it. And so does Moiraine. No, I haven’t asked her, but why else does she keep a watch on me? Did you think she wanted me to make her a kitchen knife?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She was silent for a moment, and when she spoke it was in sympathetic tones. “Poor Perrin. I left Saldaea to find adventure, and now that I’m in the heart of one, the greatest since the Breaking, all I want is to go somewhere else. You just want to be a blacksmith, and you’re going to end up in the stories whether you want it or not.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He looked away, though the scent of her still filled his head. He did not think he was likely to have any stories told about him, not unless his secret spread a long way beyond the few who knew already. Faile thought she knew everything about him, but she was wrong.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">An axe and a hammer leaned against the wall opposite him, each plain and functional, with a haft as long as his forearm. The axe was a wicked half-moon blade balanced by a thick spike, meant for violence. With the hammer he could make things, had made things, at a forge. The hammerhead weighed more than twice as much as the axe blade, but it was the axe that felt heavier by far every time he picked it up. With the axe, he had . . . . He scowled, not wanting to think about that. She was right. All he wanted was to be a blacksmith, to go home, and see his family again, and work at the smithy. But it was not to be; he knew that.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He got to his feet long enough to pick up the hammer, then sat back down. There was something comforting in holding it. “Master Luhhan always says you can’t walk away from what has to be done.” He hurried on, realizing that was a little too close to what she had called hairy-chested drivel. “He’s the blacksmith back home, the man I was apprenticed to. I’ve told you about him.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">To his surprise, she did not take the opportunity to point out his near echo. In fact, she said nothing, only looked at him, waiting for something. After a moment it came to him.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Are you leaving, then?” he asked.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She stood up, brushing her skirt. For a long moment she kept silent, as if deciding on her answer. “I do not know,” she said finally. “This is a fine mess you’ve put me in.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Me? What did I do?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Well, if you don’t know, I am certainly not going to tell you.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Scratching his beard again, he stared at the hammer in his other hand. Mat would probably know exactly what she meant. Or even old Thom Merrilin. The white-haired gleeman claimed no one understood women, but when he came out of his tiny room in the belly of the Stone he soon had half a dozen girls young enough to be his granddaughters sighing and listening to him play the harp and tell of grand adventure and romance. Faile was the only woman Perrin wanted, but sometimes he felt like a fish trying to understand a bird.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He knew she wanted him to ask. He knew that much. She might or might not tell him, but he was supposed to ask. Stubbornly he kept his mouth shut. This time he meant to wait her out.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Outside in the darkness, a cock crowed.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Faile shivered and hugged herself. “My nurse used to say that meant a death coming. Not that I believe it, of course.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He opened his mouth to agree it was foolishness, though he shivered, too, but his head whipped around at a grating sound and a thump. The axe had toppled to the floor. He only had time to frown, wondering what could have made it fall, when it shifted again, untouched, then leaped straight for him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He swung the hammer without thought. Metal ringing on metal drowned Faile’s scream; the axe flew across the room, bounced off the far wall, and darted back at him, blade first. He thought every hair on his body was trying to stand on end.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">As the axe sped by her, Faile lunged forward and grabbed the haft with both hands. It twisted in her grip, slashing toward her wide-eyed face. Barely in time Perrin leaped up, dropping the hammer to seize the axe, just keeping the half-moon blade from her flesh. He thought he would die if the axe—his axe—harmed her. He jerked it away from her so hard that the heavy spike nearly stabbed him in the chest. It would have been a fair trade, to stop the axe from hurting her, but with a sinking feeling he began to think it might not be possible.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The weapon thrashed like a thing alive, a thing with a malevolent will. It wanted Perrin—he knew that as if it had shouted at him—but it fought
with cunning. When he pulled the axe away from Faile, it used his own movement to hack at him; when he forced it from himself, it tried to reach her, as if it knew that would make him stop pushing. No matter how hard he held the haft, it spun in his hands, threatening with spike or curved blade. Already his hands ached from the effort, and his thick arms strained, muscles tight. Sweat rolled down his face. He was not sure how much longer it would be before the axe fought free of his grip. This was all madness, pure madness, with no time to think.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Get out,” he muttered through gritted teeth. “Get out of the room, Faile!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Her face was bloodless pale, but she shook her head and wrestled with the axe. “No! I will not leave you!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It will kill both of us!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She shook her head again.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Growling in his throat, he let go of the axe with one hand—his arm quivered with holding the thing one-handed; the twisting haft burned his palm—and thrust Faile away. She yelped as he wrestled her to the door. Ignoring her shouts and her fists pounding at him, he held her against the wall with a shoulder until he could pull the door open and shove her into the hallway.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Slamming the door behind her, he put his back against it, sliding the latch home with his hip as he seized the axe with both hands again. The heavy blade, gleaming and sharp, trembled within inches of his face. Laboriously, he pushed it out to arm’s length. Faile’s muted shouts penetrated the thick door, and he could feel her beating on it, but he was barely conscious of her. His yellow eyes seemed to shine, as if they reflected every scrap of light in the room.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Just you and me, now,” he snarled at the axe. “Blood and ashes, how I hate you!” Inside, a part of him came close to hysterical laughter. <span class="calibre18">Rand is the one who’s supposed to go mad, and here I am, talking to an axe! Rand! Burn him!</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Teeth bared with effort, he forced the axe back a full step from the door. The weapon vibrated, fighting to reach flesh; he could almost taste its thirst for his blood. With a roar he suddenly pulled the curved blade toward him, threw himself back. Had the axe truly been alive, he was sure he would have heard a cry of triumph as it flashed toward his head. At the last instant, he twisted, driving the axe past himself. With a heavy <span class="calibre18">thunk</span> the blade buried itself in the door.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He felt the life—he could not think what else to call it—go out of the
imprisoned weapon. Slowly, he took his hands away. The axe stayed where it was, only steel and wood again. The door seemed a good place to leave it for now, though. He wiped sweat from his face with a shaking hand. <span class="calibre18">Madness. Madness walks wherever Rand is</span>.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Abruptly he realized he could no longer hear Faile’s shouts, or her pounding. Throwing back the latch, he hastily pulled the door open. A gleaming arc of steel stuck through the thick wood on the outside, shining in the light of wide-spaced lamps along the tapestry-hung hallway.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Faile stood there, hands raised, frozen in the act of beating on the door. Eyes wide and wondering, she touched the tip of her nose. “Another inch,” she said faintly, “and . . . .”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">With a sudden start, she flung herself on him, hugging him fiercely, raining kisses on his neck and beard between incoherent murmurs. Just as quickly, she pushed back, running anxious hands over his chest and arms. “Are you hurt? Are you injured? Did it . . . ?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I’m all right,” he told her. “But are you? I did not mean to frighten you.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She peered up at him. “Truly? You are not hurt in any way?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Completely unhurt. I—” Her full-armed slap made his head ring like hammer on anvil.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You great hairy lummox! I thought you were dead! I was afraid it had killed you! I thought—!” She cut off as he caught her second slap in mid-swing.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Please don’t do that again,” he said quietly. The smarting imprint of her hand burned on his cheek, and he thought his jaw would ache the rest of the night.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He gripped her wrist as gently as he would have a bird, but though she struggled to pull free, his hand did not budge an inch. Compared to swinging a hammer all day at the forge, holding her was no effort at all, even after his fight against the axe. Abruptly she seemed to decide to ignore his grip and stared him in the eye; neither dark nor golden eyes blinked. “I could have helped you. You had no right—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I had every right,” he said firmly. “You could not have helped. If you had stayed, we’d both be dead. I couldn’t have fought—not the way I had to—and kept you safe, too.” She opened her mouth, but he raised his voice and went on. “I know you hate the word. I’ll try my best not to treat you like porcelain, but if you ask me to watch you die, I will tie you like a lamb for market and send you off to Mistress Luhhan. She won’t stand for any such nonsense.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Tonguing a tooth and wondering if it was loose, he almost wished he could see Faile trying to ride roughshod over Alsbet Luhhan. The blacksmith’s wife kept her husband in line with scarcely more effort than she needed for her house. Even Nynaeve had been careful of her sharp tongue around Mistress Luhhan. The tooth still held tight, he decided.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Faile laughed suddenly, a low, throaty laugh. “You would, too, wouldn’t you? Don’t think you would not dance with the Dark One if you tried, though.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Perrin was so startled he let go of her. He could not see any real difference between what he had just said and what he had said before, but the one had made her blaze up, while this she took . . . fondly. Not that he was certain the threat to kill him was entirely a joke. Faile carried knives hidden about her person, and she knew how to use them.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She rubbed her wrist ostentatiously and muttered something under her breath. He caught the words “hairy ox,” and promised himself he would shave every last whisker of that fool beard. He would.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Aloud, she said, “The axe. That was him, wasn’t it? The Dragon Reborn, trying to kill us.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It must have been Rand.” He emphasized the name. He did not like thinking of Rand the other way. He preferred remembering the Rand he had grown up with in Emond’s Field. “Not trying to kill us, though. Not him.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She gave him a wry smile, more a grimace. “If he was not trying, I hope he never does.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I don’t know what he was doing. But I mean to tell him to stop it, and right now.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I don’t know why I care for a man who worries so about his own safety,” she murmured.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He frowned at her quizzically, wondering what she meant, but she only tucked her arm through his. He was still wondering as they started off through the Stone. The axe he left where it was; stuck in the door, it would not harm anyone.</span></div>
<div class="p-blanc"><span class="calibre22"> <br class="calibre8"/></span></div>
<div class="p-blanc"><span class="calibre22"> <br class="calibre8"/></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="calibre22">Teeth clamped on a long-stemmed pipe, Mat opened his coat a bit more and tried to concentrate on the cards lying facedown in front of him, and on the coins spilled in the middle of the table. He had had the bright red coat made to an Andoran pattern, of the best wool, with golden embroidery scrolling around the cuffs and long collar, but day by day he was
reminded how much farther south Tear lay than Andor. Sweat ran down his face, and plastered the shirt to his back.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">None of his companions around the table appeared to notice the heat at all, despite coats that looked even heavier than his, with fat, swollen sleeves, all padded silks and brocades and satin stripes. Two men in red-and-gold livery kept the gamblers’ silver cups full of wine and proffered shining silver trays of olives and cheeses and nuts. The heat did not seem to affect the servants, either, though now and again one of them yawned behind his hand when he thought no one was looking. The night was not young.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Mat refrained from lifting his cards to check them again. They would not have changed. Three rulers, the highest cards in three of the five suits, were already good enough to win most hands.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He would have been more comfortable dicing; there was seldom a deck of cards to be found in the places he usually gambled, where silver changed hands in fifty different dice games, but these young Tairen lordlings would rather wear rags than play at dice. Peasants tossed dice, though they were careful not to say so in his hearing. It was not his temper they feared, but who they thought his friends were. This game called chop was what they played, hour after hour, night after night, using cards hand-painted and lacquered by a man in the city who had been made well-to-do by these fellows and others like them. Only women or horses could draw them away, but neither for long.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Still, he had picked up the game quickly enough, and if his luck was not as good as it was with dice, it would do. A fat purse lay beside his cards, and another even fatter rested in his pocket. A fortune, he would have thought once, back in Emond’s Field, enough to live the rest of his life in luxury. His ideas of luxury had changed since leaving the Two Rivers. The young lords kept their coin in careless, shining piles, but some old habits he had no intention of changing. In the taverns and inns it was sometimes necessary to depart quickly. Especially if his luck was really with him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">When he had enough to keep himself as he wanted, he would leave the Stone just as quickly. Before Moiraine knew what he was thinking. He would have been days gone by now, if he had had his way. It was just that there was gold to be had here. One night at this table could earn him more than a week of dicing in taverns. If only his luck would catch.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He put on a small frown and puffed worriedly at his pipe, to look unsure whether his cards were good enough to go on with. Two of the young
lords had pipes in their teeth, too, but silver-worked, with amber bits. In the hot, still air, their perfumed tabac smelled like a fire in a lady’s dressing chamber. Not that Mat had ever been in a lady’s dressing chamber. An illness that nearly killed him had left his memory as full of holes as the best lace, yet he was sure he would have remembered that. <span class="calibre18">Not even the Dark One would be mean enough to make me forget that</span>.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Sea Folk ship docked today,” Reimon muttered around his pipe. The broad-shouldered young lord’s beard was oiled and trimmed to a neat point. That was the latest fashion among the younger lords, and Reimon chased the latest fashion as assiduously as he chased women. Which was only a little less diligently than he gambled. He tossed a silver crown onto the pile in the middle of the table for another card. “A raker. Fastest ships there are, rakers, so they say. Outrun the wind, they say. I would like to see that. Burn my soul, but I would.” He did not bother to look at the card he was dealt; he never did until he had a full five.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The plump, pink-cheeked man between Reimon and Mat gave an amused chuckle. “You want to see the ship, Reimon? You mean the girls, do you not? The women. Exotic Sea Folk beauties, with their rings and baubles and swaying walks, eh?” He put in a crown and took his card, grimacing when he peeked at it. That meant nothing; going by his face, Edorion’s cards were always low and mismatched. He won more than he lost, though. “Well, perhaps my luck will be better with the Sea Folk girls.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The dealer, tall and slender on Mat’s other side, with a pointed beard even more darkly luxuriant than Reimon’s, laid a finger alongside his nose. “You think to be lucky with those, Edorion? The way they keep to themselves, you’ll be lucky to catch a whiff of their perfume.” He made a wafting gesture, inhaling deeply with a sigh, and the other lordlings laughed, even Edorion.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">A plain-faced youth named Estean laughed loudest of all, scrubbing a hand through lank hair that kept falling over his forehead. Replace his fine yellow coat with drab wool, and he could have passed for a farmer, instead of the son of a High Lord with the richest estates in Tear and in his own right the wealthiest man at the table. He had also drunk much more wine than any of the others.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Swaying across the man next to him, a foppish fellow named Baran who always seemed to be looking down his sharp nose, Estean poked the dealer with a none too steady finger. Baran leaned back, twisting his mouth around his pipestem as if he feared Estean might throw up.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“That’s good, Carlomin,” Estean gurgled. “You think so too, don’t you,
Baran? Edorion won’t get a sniff. If he wants to try his luck . . . take a gamble . . . he ought to go after the Aiel wenches, like Mat, here. All those spears and knives. Burn my soul. Like asking a lion to dance.” Dead silence dropped around the table. Estean laughed on alone, then blinked and scrubbed fingers through his hair again. “What’s the matter? Did I say something? Oh! Oh, yes. Them.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Mat barely stopped a scowl. The fool had to bring up the Aiel. The only worse subject would have been Aes Sedai; they would almost rather have Aiel walking the corridors, staring down any Tairen who got in their way, than even one Aes Sedai, and these men thought they had four, at least. He fingered an Andoran silver crown from his purse on the table and pushed it into the pot. Carlomin dealt out the card slowly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Mat lifted it carefully with a thumbnail, and did not let himself so much as blink. The Ruler of Cups, a High Lord of Tear. The rulers in a deck varied according to the land where the cards were made, with the nation’s own ruler always as Ruler of Cups, the highest suit. These cards were old. He had already seen new decks with Rand’s face or something like it on the Ruler of Cups, complete with the Dragon banner. Rand the ruler of Tear; that still seemed ludicrous enough to make him want to pinch himself. Rand was a shepherd, a good fellow to have fun with when he was not going all over-serious and responsible. Rand the Dragon Reborn, now; that told him he was a stone fool to be sitting there, where Moiraine could put her hand on him whenever she wanted, waiting to see what Rand would do next. Maybe Thom Merrilin would go with him. Or Perrin. Only, Thom seemed to be settling into the Stone as if he never meant to leave, and Perrin was not going anywhere unless Faile crooked a finger. Well, Mat was ready to travel alone, if need be.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Yet there was silver in the middle of the table and gold in front of the lordlings, and if he was dealt the fifth ruler, there was no hand in chop could beat him. Not that he really needed it. Suddenly he could feel luck tickling his mind. Not tingling as it did with the dice, of course, but he was already certain no one was going to beat four rulers. The Tairens had been betting wildly all night, the price of ten farms crossing the table on the quickest hands.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">But Carlomin was staring at the deck of cards in his hand instead of buying his fourth, and Baran was puffing his pipe furiously and stacking the coins in front of him as if ready to stuff them into his pockets. Reimon wore a scowl behind his beard, and Edorion was frowning at his nails.
Only Estean appeared unaffected; he grinned uncertainly around the table, perhaps already forgetting what he had said. They usually managed to put some sort of good face on the situation if the Aiel came up, but the hour was late, and the wine had flowed freely.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Mat scoured his mind for a way to keep them and their gold from walking away from his cards. One glance at their faces was enough to tell him that simply changing the subject would not be enough. But there was another way. If he made them laugh at the Aiel . . . . <span class="calibre18">Is it worth making them laugh at me, too?</span> Chewing his pipestem, he tried to think of something else.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Baran picked up a stack of gold in each hand and moved to stick them in his pockets.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I might just try these Sea Folk women,” Mat said quickly, taking his pipe to gesture with. “Odd things happen when you chase Aiel girls. Very odd. Like the game they call Maidens’ Kiss.” He had their attention, but Baran had not put down the coins, and Carlomin still showed no sign of buying a card.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Estean gave a drunken guffaw. “Kiss you with steel in your ribs, I suppose. Maidens of the Spear, you see. Steel. Spear in your ribs. Burn my soul.” No one else laughed. But they were listening.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Not quite.” Mat managed a grin. <span class="calibre18">Burn me, I’ve told this much. I might as well tell the rest</span>. “Rhuarc said if I wanted to get along with the Maidens, I should ask them how to play Maidens’ Kiss. He said that was the best way to get to know them.” It still sounded like one of the kissing games back home, like Kiss the Daisies. He had never considered the Aiel clan chief a man to play tricks. He would be warier the next time. He made an effort to improve the grin. “So I went along to Bain and . . .” Reimon frowned impatiently. None of them knew any Aiel’s name but Rhuarc, and none of them wanted to. Mat dropped the names and hurried on “ . . . went along dumb as a bull-goose fool, and asked them to show me.” He should have suspected something from the wide smiles that had bloomed on their faces. Like cats who had been asked to dance by a mouse. “Before I knew what was happening, I had a fistful of spears around my neck like a collar. I could have shaved myself with one sneeze.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The others around the table exploded in laughter, from Reimon’s wheezing to Estean’s wine-soaked bray.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Mat left them to it. He could almost feel the spearpoints again, pricking if he so much as twitched a finger. Bain, laughing all the while, had told him she had never heard of a man actually asking to play Maidens’ Kiss.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Carlomin stroked his beard and spoke into Mat’s hesitation. “You cannot stop there. Go on. When was this? Two nights ago, I’ll wager. When you didn’t come for the game, and no one knew where you were.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I was playing stones with Thom Merrilin that night,” Mat said quickly. “This was days ago.” He was glad he could lie with a straight face. “They each took a kiss. That’s all. If she thought it was a good kiss, they eased up with the spears. If not, they pushed a little harder; to encourage, you might say. That was all. I’ll tell you this; I got nicked less than I do shaving.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He stuck his pipe back between his teeth. If they wanted to know more, they could go ask to play the game themselves. He almost hoped some of them were fool enough. <span class="calibre18">Bloody Aiel women and their bloody spears</span>. He had not made it to his own bed until daybreak.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It would be more than enough for me,” Carlomin said dryly. “The Light burn my soul if it would not.” He tossed a silver crown into the center of the table and dealt himself another card. “Maidens’ Kiss.” He shook with mirth, and another ripple of laughter ran around the table.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Baran bought his fifth card, and Estean fumbled a coin from the heap scattered in front of him, peering at it to see what it was. They would not stop now.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Savages,” Baran muttered around his pipe. “Ignorant savages. That is all they are, burn my soul. Live in caves, out in the Waste. In caves! No one but a savage could live in the Waste.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Reimon nodded. “At least they serve the Lord Dragon. I would take a hundred Defenders and clean them out of the Stone, if not for that.” Baran and Carlomin growled fierce agreement.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">It was no effort for Mat to keep his face straight. He had heard much the same before. Boasting was easy when no one expected you to carry through. A hundred Defenders? Even if Rand stood aside for some reason, the few hundred Aiel holding the Stone could probably keep it against any army Tear could raise. Not that they seemed to want the Stone, really. Mat suspected they were only there because Rand was. He did not think any of these lordlings had figured that out—they tried to ignore the Aiel as much as possible—but he doubted it would make them feel any better.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Mat.” Estean fanned his cards out in one hand, rearranging them as if he could not decide what order they were meant to go in. “Mat, you will speak to the Lord Dragon, won’t you?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“About what?” Mat asked cautiously. Too many of these Tairens knew he and Rand had grown up together to suit him, and they seemed to think
he was arm in arm with Rand whenever he was out of their sight. None of them would have gone near his own brother if he could channel. He did not know why they thought him a bigger fool.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Didn’t I say?” The plain-faced man squinted at his cards and scratched his head, then brightened. “Oh, yes. His proclamation, Mat. The Lord Dragon’s. His last one. Where he said commoners had the right to call lords before a magistrate. Who ever heard of a lord being summoned to a magistrate? And for peasants!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Mat’s hand tightened on his purse until the coins inside grated together. “It would be a shame,” he said quietly, “if you were tried and judged just for having your way with a fisherman’s daughter whatever she wanted, or for having some farmer beaten for splashing mud on your cloak.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The others shifted uneasily, catching his mood, but Estean nodded, head bobbing so it seemed about to fall off. “Exactly. Though it wouldn’t come to that, of course. A lord being tried before a magistrate? Of course not. Not really.” He laughed drunkenly at his cards. “No fishermen’s daughters. Smell of fish, you see, however you have them washed. A plump farm girl is best.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Mat told himself he was there to gamble. He told himself to ignore the fool’s blather, reminded himself of how much gold he could take out of Estean’s purse. His tongue did not listen, though. “Who knows what it might come to? Hangings, maybe.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Edorion gave him a sidelong look, guarded and uneasy. “Do we have to talk about . . . about commoners, Estean? What about old Astoril’s daughters? Have you decided which you’ll marry yet?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What? Oh. Oh, I’ll flip a coin, I suppose.” Estean frowned at his cards, shifted one, and frowned again. “Medore has two or three pretty maids. Perhaps Medore.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Mat took a long drink from his silver winecup to keep from hitting the man in his farmer’s face. He was still on his first cup; the two servants had given up trying to add more. If he hit Estean, none of them would lift a hand to stop him. Not even Estean. Because he was the Lord Dragon’s friend. He wished he was in a tavern somewhere out in the city, where some dockman might question his luck and only a quick tongue, or quick feet, or quick hands would see him leave with a whole skin. Now that <span class="calibre18">was</span> a fool thought.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Edorion glanced at Mat again, measuring his mood. “I heard a rumor today. I hear the Lord Dragon is taking us to war with Illian.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Mat gagged on his wine. “War?” he spluttered.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“War,” Reimon agreed happily around his pipestem.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Are you certain?” Carlomin said, and Baran added, “I’ve heard no rumors.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I heard it just today, from three or four tongues.” Edorion seemed to be absorbed in his cards. “Who can say how true it is?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It must be true,” Reimon said. “With the Lord Dragon to lead us, holding <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>, we’ll not even have to fight. He will scatter their armies, and we will march straight into Illian. Too bad, in a way. Burn my soul if it isn’t. I would like a chance to match swords with the Illianers.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You’ll get no chance with the Lord Dragon leading,” Baran said. “They will fall on their knees as soon as they see the Dragon banner.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“And if they do not,” Carlomin added with a laugh, “the Lord Dragon will blast them with lightning where they stand.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Illian first,” Reimon said. “And then . . . then we’ll conquer the world for the Lord Dragon. You tell him I said so, Mat. The whole world.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Mat shook his head. A month gone, they would have been horrified by even the idea of a man who could channel, a man doomed to go mad and die horribly. Now they were ready to follow Rand into battle, and trust his power to win for them. Trust the Power, though it was not likely they would put it that way. Yet he supposed they had to find something to hang on to. The invincible Stone was in the hands of the Aiel. The Dragon Reborn was in his chambers a hundred feet above their heads, and <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> was with him. Three thousand years of Tairen belief and history lay in ruins, and the world had been turned on its head. He wondered whether he had handled it any better; his own world had gone all askew in little more than a year. He rolled a gold Tairen crown across the backs of his fingers. However well he had done, he would not go back.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“When will we march, Mat?” Baran asked.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I don’t know,” he said slowly. “I don’t think Rand would start a war.” Unless he had gone mad already. That hardly bore thinking about.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The others looked as if he had assured them the sun would not come up tomorrow.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“We are all loyal to the Lord Dragon, of course.” Edorion frowned at his cards. “Out in the countryside, though . . . . I hear that some of the High Lords, a few, have been trying to raise an army to take back the Stone.” Suddenly no one was looking at Mat, though Estean still seemed to be trying to make out his cards. “When the Lord Dragon takes us to war, of course, it will all melt away. In any case, we are loyal, here in the Stone. The High Lords, too, I am certain. It is only the few out in the countryside.”</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Their loyalty would not outlast their fear of the Dragon Reborn. For a moment Mat felt as though he were planning to abandon Rand in a pit of vipers. Then he remembered what Rand was. It was more like abandoning a weasel in a henyard. Rand had been a friend. The Dragon Reborn, though . . . . Who could be a friend to the Dragon Reborn? <span class="calibre18">I’m not abandoning anybody. He could probably pull the Stone down on their heads, if he wanted to. On my head, too</span>. He told himself again that it was time to be gone.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“No fishermen’s daughters,” Estean mumbled. “You will speak to the Lord Dragon?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It is your turn, Mat,” Carlomin said anxiously. He looked half afraid, though what he feared—that Estean would anger Mat again, or that the talk might go back to loyalty—was impossible to say. “Will you buy the fifth card, or stack?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Mat realized he had not been paying attention. Everyone but himself and Carlomin had five cards, though Reimon had neatly stacked his facedown beside the pot to show that he was out. Mat hesitated, pretending to think, then sighed and tossed another coin toward the pile.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">As the silver crown bounced end over end, he suddenly felt luck grow from trickles to a flood. Every ping of silver against wooden tabletop rang clear in his head; he could have called face or sigil and known how the coin would land on any bounce. Just as he knew what his next card would be before Carlomin laid it in front of him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Sliding his cards together on the table, he fanned them in one hand. The Ruler of Flames stared at him alongside the other four, the Amyrlin Seat balancing a flame on her palm, though she looked nothing like Siuan Sanche. However the Tairens felt about Aes Sedai, they acknowledged the power of Tar Valon, even if Flames was the lowest suit.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">What were the odds of being dealt all five? His luck was best with random things, like dice, but perhaps a little more was beginning to rub off on cards. “The Light burn my bones to ash if it is not so,” he muttered. Or that was what he meant to say.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“There,” Estean all but shouted. “You cannot deny it this time. That was the Old Tongue. Something about burning, and bones.” He grinned around the table. “My tutor would be proud. I ought to send him a gift. If I can find out where he went.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Nobles were supposed to be able to speak the Old Tongue, though in reality few knew more than Estean seemed to. The young lords set to arguing over exactly what Mat had said. They seemed to think it had been a comment on the heat.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Goose bumps pebbled Mat’s skin as he tried to recall the words that had just come out of his mouth. A string of gibberish, yet it almost seemed he should understand. <span class="calibre18">Burn Moiraine! If she’d left me alone, I wouldn’t have holes in my memory big enough for a wagon and team, and I wouldn’t be spouting . . . whatever it bloody is!</span> He would also be milking his father’s cows instead of walking the world with a pocketful of gold, but he managed to ignore that part of it.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Are you here to gamble,” he said harshly, “or babble like old women over their knitting!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“To gamble,” Baran said curtly. “Three crowns, gold!” He tossed the coins onto the pot.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“And three more besides.” Estean hiccoughed and added six golden crowns to the pile.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Suppressing a grin, Mat forgot about the Old Tongue. It was easy enough; he did not want to think about it. Besides, if they were starting this strongly, he might win enough on this hand to leave in the morning. <span class="calibre18">And if he’s crazy enough to start a war, I’ll leave if I have to walk</span>.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Outside in the darkness, a cock crowed. Mat shifted uneasily and told himself not to be foolish. No one was going to die.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">His eyes dropped to his cards—and blinked. The Amyrlin’s flame had been replaced by a knife. While he was telling himself he was tired and seeing things, she plunged the tiny blade into the back of his hand.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">With a hoarse yell, he flung the cards away and hurled himself backward, overturning his chair, kicking the table with both feet as he fell. The air seemed to thicken like honey. Everything moved as if time had slowed, but at the same time everything seemed to happen at once. Other cries echoed his, hollow shouts reverberating inside a cavern. He and the chair drifted back and down; the table floated upward.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Ruler of Flames hung in the air, growing larger, staring at him with a cruel smile. Now close to life-size, she started to step out of the card; she was still a painted shape, with no depth, but she reached for him with her blade, red with his blood as if it had already been driven into his heart. Beside her the Ruler of Cups began to grow, the Tairen High Lord drawing his sword.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Mat floated, yet somehow he managed to reach the dagger in his left sleeve and hurl it in the same motion, straight for the Amyrlin’s heart. If this thing had a heart. The second knife came into his left hand smoothly and left more smoothly. The two blades drifted through the air like thistledown.
He wanted to scream, but that first yell of shock and outrage still filled his mouth. The Ruler of Rods was expanding beside the first two cards, the Queen of Andor gripping the rod like a bludgeon, her red-gold hair framing a madwoman’s snarl.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He was still falling, still yelling that drawn-out yell. The Amyrlin was free of her card, the High Lord striding out with his sword. The flat shapes moved almost as slowly as he. Almost. He had proof the steel in their hands could cut, and no doubt the rod could crack a skull. His skull.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">His thrown daggers moved as if sinking in jelly. He was sure the cock had crowed for him. Whatever his father said, the omen had been real. But he would not give up and die. Somehow he had two more daggers out from under his coat, one in either hand. Struggling to twist in midair, to get his feet under him, he threw one knife at the golden-haired figure with the bludgeon. The other he held on to as he tried to turn himself, to land ready to face . . . .</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The world lurched back into normal motion, and he landed awkwardly on his side, hard enough to drive the wind out of him. Desperately he struggled to his feet, drawing another knife from under his coat. You could not carry too many, Thom claimed. Neither was needed.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">For a moment he thought cards and figures had vanished. Or maybe he had imagined it all. Maybe he was the one going mad. Then he saw the cards, back to ordinary size, pinned to one of the dark wood panels by his still quivering knives. He took a deep, ragged breath.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The table lay on its side, coins still spinning across the floor where lordlings and servants crouched among scattered cards. They gaped at Mat and his knives, those in his hands and those in the wall, with equally wide eyes. Estean snatched a silver pitcher that had somehow escaped being overturned and began pouring wine down his throat, the excess spilling over his chin and down his chest.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Just because you do not have the cards to win,” Edorion said hoarsely, “there is no need to—” He cut off with a shudder.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You saw it, too.” Mat slipped the knives back into their sheaths. A thin trickle of blood ran down the back of his hand from the tiny wound. “Don’t pretend you went blind!”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I saw nothing,” Reimon said woodenly. “Nothing!” He began crawling across the floor, gathering up gold and silver, concentrating on the coins as if they were the most important thing in the world. The others were doing the same, except Estean, who scrambled about checking the
fallen pitchers for any that still held wine. One of the servants had his face hidden in his hands; the other, eyes closed, was apparently praying in a low, breathless whine.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">With a muttered oath, Mat strode to where his knives pinned the three cards to the panel. They were only playing cards again, just stiff paper with the clear lacquer cracked. But the figure of the Amyrlin still held a dagger instead of a flame. He tasted blood and realized he was sucking the cut in the back of his hand.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Hastily he wrenched his knives free, tearing each card in half before tucking the blade away. After a moment, he hunted through the cards littering the floor until he found the rulers of Coins and Winds, and tore them across, too. He felt a little foolish—it was over and done with; the cards were just cards again—but he could not help it.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">None of the young lords crawling about on hands and knees tried to stop him. They scrambled out of his way, not even glancing at him. There would be no more gambling tonight, and maybe not for some nights to come. At least, not with him. Whatever had happened, it had been aimed at him, clearly. Even more clearly, it had to have been done with the One Power. They wanted no part of that.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Burn you, Rand!” he muttered under his breath. “If you have to go mad, leave me out of it!” His pipe lay in two pieces, the stem bitten through cleanly. Angrily he grabbed his purse from the floor and stalked out of the room.</span></div>
<div class="p-blanc"><span class="calibre22"> <br class="calibre8"/></span></div>
<div class="p-blanc"><span class="calibre22"> <br class="calibre8"/></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="calibre22">In his darkened bedchamber Rand tossed uneasily on a bed wide enough for five people. He was dreaming.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Through a shadowy forest Moiraine was prodding him with a sharp stick toward where the Amyrlin Seat waited, sitting on a stump with a rope halter for his neck in her hands. Dim shapes moved half-seen through the trees, stalking, hunting him; here a dagger blade flashed in the failing light, over there he caught a glimpse of ropes ready for binding. Slender and not as tall as his shoulder, Moiraine wore an expression he had never seen on her face. Fear. Sweating, she prodded harder, trying to hurry him to the Amyrlin’s halter. Darkfriends and the Forsaken in the shadows, the White Tower’s leash ahead and Moiraine behind. Dodging Moiraine’s stick, he fled.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It is too late for that,” she called after him, but he had to get back. Back.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Muttering, he thrashed on the bed, then was still, breathing more easily for a moment.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He was in the Waterwood back home, sunlight slanting through the trees to sparkle on the pond in front of him. There was green moss on the rocks at this end of the pond, and thirty paces away at the other end a small arc of wildflowers. This was where, as a child, he had learned to swim.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You should have a swim now.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He spun around with a start. Min stood there, grinning at him in her boy’s coat and breeches, and next to her, Elayne, with her red-golden curls, in a green silk gown fit for her mother’s palace.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">It was Min who had spoken, but Elayne added, “The water looks inviting, Rand. No one will bother us here.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I don’t know,” he began slowly. Min cut him off by twining her fingers behind his neck and pulling herself up on tiptoe to kiss him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She repeated Elayne’s words in a soft murmur. “No one will bother us here.” She stepped back and doffed her coat, then attacked the laces of her shirt.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand stared, the more so when he realized Elayne’s gown was lying on the mossy ground. The Daughter-Heir was bending, arms crossed, gathering up the hem of her shift.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What are you doing?” he demanded in a strangled voice.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Getting ready to go swimming with you,” Min replied.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Elayne flashed him a smile, and hoisted the shift over her head.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He turned his back hastily, though half wanting not to. And found himself staring at Egwene, her big, dark eyes looking back at him sadly. Without a word she turned and vanished into the trees.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Wait!” he shouted after her. “I can explain.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He began to run; he had to find her. But as he reached the edge of trees, Min’s voice stopped him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Don’t go, Rand.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She and Elayne were in the water already, only their heads showing as they swam lazily in the middle of the pond.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Come back,” Elayne called, lifting a slim arm to beckon. “Do you not deserve what you want for a change?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He shifted his feet, wanting to move but unable to decide which way. What he wanted. The words sounded strange. What did he want? He raised a hand to his face, to wipe away what felt like sweat. Festering flesh almost obliterated the heron branded on his palm; white bone showed through red-edged gaps.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">With a jerk, he came awake, lying there shivering in the dark heat. Sweat soaked his smallclothes, and the linen sheets beneath his back. His side burned, where an old wound had never healed properly. He traced the rough scar, a circle nearly an inch across, still tender after all this time. Even Moiraine’s Aes Sedai Healing could not mend it completely. <span class="calibre18">But I’m not rotting yet. And I’m not mad, either. Not yet</span>. Not yet. That said it all. He wanted to laugh, and wondered if that meant he was a little mad already.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Dreaming about Min and Elayne, dreaming of them like that . . . . Well, it was not madness, but it was surely foolishness. Neither one of them had ever looked at him in that way when he was awake. Egwene he had been all but promised to since they were both children. The betrothal words had never been spoken in front of the Women’s Circle, but everyone in and around Emond’s Field knew they would marry one day.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">That one day would never come, of course; not now, not with the fate that lay ahead of a man who channeled. Egwene must have realized that, too. She must have. She was all wrapped up in becoming Aes Sedai. Still, women were odd; she might think she could be an Aes Sedai and marry him anyway, channeling or no channeling. How could he tell her that he did not want to marry her anymore, that he loved her like a sister? But there would not be any need to tell her, he was sure. He could hide behind what he was. She had to understand that. What man could ask a woman to marry him when he knew he had only a few years, if he was lucky, before he went insane, before he began to rot alive? He shivered despite the heat.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">I need sleep</span>. The High Lords would be back in the morning, maneuvering for his favor. For the Dragon Reborn’s favor. <span class="calibre18">Maybe I won’t dream, this time</span>. He started to roll over, searching for a dry place on the sheets—and froze, listening to small rustlings in the darkness. He was not alone.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Sword That Is Not a Sword lay across the room, beyond his reach, on a thronelike stand the High Lords had given him, no doubt in the hopes he would keep <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> out of their sight. <span class="calibre18">Someone wanting to steal</span> Callandor. A second thought came. <span class="calibre18">Or to kill the Dragon Reborn</span>. He did not need Thom’s whispered warnings to know that the High Lord’s professions of undying loyalty were only words of necessity.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He emptied himself of thought and emotions, assuming the Void; that much came without effort. Floating in the cold emptiness within himself, thought and emotion outside, he reached for the True Source. This time he touched it easily, which was not always the case.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">Saidin</span> filled him like a torrent of white heat and light, exalting him with life, sickening him with the foulness of the Dark One’s taint, like a
skim of sewage floating on pure, sweet water. The torrent threatened to wash him away, burn him up, engulf him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Fighting the flood, he mastered it by bare effort of will and rolled from the bed, channeling the Power as he landed on his feet in the stance to begin the sword-form called Apple Blossoms in the Wind. His enemies could not be many or they would have made more noise; the gently named form was meant for use against more than one opponent.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">As his feet hit the carpet, a sword was in his hands, with a long hilt and a slightly curved blade sharp on only one edge. It looked to have been wrought from flame yet it did not feel even warm. The figure of a heron stood black against the yellow-red of the blade. In the same instant every candle and gilded lamp burst alight, small mirrors behind them swelling the illumination. Larger mirrors on the walls and two stand-mirrors reflected it further, until he could have read comfortably anywhere in the large room.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> sat undisturbed, a sword seemingly of glass, hilt and blade, on a stand as tall as a man and just as wide, the wood ornately carved and gilded and set with precious stones. The furnishings, too, were all gilded and begemmed, bed and chairs and benches, wardrobes and chests and washstand. The pitcher and bowl were golden Sea Folk porcelain, as thin as leaves. The broad Tarabon carpet, in scrolls of scarlet and gold and blue, could have fed an entire village for months. Almost every flat surface held more delicate Sea Folk porcelain, or else goblets and bowls and ornaments of gold worked with silver, and silver chased with gold. On the broad marble mantel over the fireplace, two silver wolves with ruby eyes tried to pull down a golden stag a good three feet tall. Draperies of scarlet silk embroidered with eagles in thread-of-gold hung at the narrow windows, stirring slightly in a failing wind. Books lay wherever there was room, leather-bound, wood-bound, some tattered and still dusty from the deepest shelves of the Stone’s library.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Now, where he had thought to see assassins, or thieves, one beautiful young woman stood hesitant and surprised in the middle of the carpet, black hair falling in shining waves to her shoulders. Her thin, white silk robe emphasized more than it hid. Berelain, ruler of the city-state of Mayene, was the last person he had expected.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">After one wide-eyed start, she made a deep, graceful curtsy that drew her garments tight. “I am unarmed, my Lord Dragon. I submit myself to your search, if you doubt me.” Her smile suddenly made him uncomfortably aware that he wore nothing but his smallclothes.</span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">I’ll be burned if she makes me scramble around trying to cover myself</span>. The thought floated beyond the Void. <span class="calibre18">I didn’t ask her to walk in on me. To</span> sneak <span class="calibre18">in</span>! Anger and embarrassment drifted along the borders of emptiness too, but his face reddened all the same; dimly he was aware of it, aware of the knowledge deepening the flush in his cheeks. So coldly calm within the Void; outside . . . . He could feel each individual droplet of sweat sliding down his chest and back. It took a real effort of stubborn will to stand there under her eyes. <span class="calibre18">Search her? The Light help me!</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Relaxing his stance, he let the sword vanish but held the narrow flow connecting him to <span class="calibre18">saidin</span>. It was like drinking from a hole in a dike when the whole long mound of earth wanted to give way, the water sweet as honeyed wine and sickening as a rivulet through a midden.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He did not know much of this woman, except that she walked through the Stone as if it were her palace in Mayene. Thom said the First of Mayene asked questions constantly, of everyone. Questions about Rand. Which might have been natural, given what he was, but they made him no easier in his mind. And she had not returned to Mayene. That was not natural. She had been held captive in all but name for months, until his arrival, cut off from her throne and the ruling of her small nation. Most people would have taken the first opportunity to get away from a man who could channel.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“What are you doing here?” He knew he sounded harsh, and did not care. “There were Aiel guarding that door when I went to sleep. How did you come past them?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Berelain’s lips curved up a trifle more; to Rand it seemed the room had gotten suddenly even hotter. “They passed me through immediately, when I said I had been summoned by the Lord Dragon.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Summoned? I didn’t summon anybody.” <span class="calibre18">Stop this</span>, he told himself. <span class="calibre18">She’s a queen, or the next thing to it. You know as much about the ways of queens as you do about flying</span>. He tried to make himself be civil, only he did not know what to call the First of Mayene. “My Lady . . .” That would have to do. “ . . . why would I summon you at this time of night?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She gave a low, rich laugh, deep in her throat; even wrapped in emotionless emptiness it seemed to tickle his skin, make the hairs stir on his arms and legs. Suddenly he took in her clinging garb as if for the first time, and felt himself go red all over again. <span class="calibre18">She can’t mean . . . . Can she? Light, I’ve never said two words to her before</span>.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Perhaps I wish to talk, my Lord Dragon.” She let the pale robe fall to
the floor, revealing an even thinner white silk garment he could only call a nightgown. It left her smooth shoulders completely bare, and exposed a considerable expanse of pale bosom. He found himself wondering distantly what held it up. It was difficult not to stare. “You are a long way from your home, like me. The nights especially seem lonely.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Tomorrow, I will be happy to talk with you.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“But during the day, people surround you. Petitioners. High Lords. Aiel.” She gave a shiver; he told himself he really ought to look away, but he could as easily have stopped breathing. He had never before been so aware of his own reactions when wrapped in the Void. “The Aiel frighten me, and I do not like Tairen lords of any sort.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">About the Tairens he could believe her, but he did not think anything frightened this woman. <span class="calibre18">Burn me, she’s in a strange man’s bedchamber in the middle of the night, only half-dressed, and I’m the one who’s jumpy as a cat in a dog run, Void or no</span>. It was time to put an end to things before they went too far.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“It would be better if you return to your own bedchamber, my Lady.” Part of him wanted to tell her to put on a cloak, too. A thick cloak. Part of him did. “It . . . it is really too late for talking. Tomorrow. In daylight.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She gave him a slanted, quizzical look. “Have you absorbed stuffy Tairen ways already, my Lord Dragon? Or is this reticence something from your Two Rivers? We are not so . . . formal . . . in Mayene.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“My Lady . . . .” He tried to sound formal; if she did not like formality, that was what he wanted. “I am promised to Egwene al’Vere, my Lady.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“You mean the Aes Sedai, my Lord Dragon? If she really is Aes Sedai. She is quite young—perhaps too young—to wear the ring and the shawl.” Berelain spoke as if Egwene were a child, though she herself could not be more than a year older than Rand, if that, and he had only a little over two years on Egwene. “My Lord Dragon, I do not mean to come between you. Marry her, if she is Green Ajah. I would never aspire to wed the Dragon Reborn himself. Forgive me if I overstep myself, but I told you we are not so . . . formal in Mayene. May I call you Rand?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand surprised himself by sighing regretfully. There had been a glint in her eye, a slight shift of expression, gone quickly, when she mentioned marrying the Dragon Reborn. If she had not considered it before, she had now. The Dragon Reborn, not Rand al’Thor; the man of prophecy, not the shepherd from the Two Rivers. He was not shocked, exactly; some girls back home mooned over whoever proved himself fastest or strongest in the games at Bel Tine and Sunday, and now and again a woman set her eyes on
the man with the richest fields or the largest flocks. It would have been good to think she wanted Rand al’Thor. “It is time for you to go, my Lady,” he said quietly.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She stepped closer. “I can feel your eyes on me, Rand.” Her voice was smoky heat. “I am no village girl tied to her mother’s apron, and I know you want—”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Do you think I’m made of stone, woman?” She jumped at his roar, but the next instant she was crossing the carpet, reaching for him, her eyes dark pools that could pull a man into their depths.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Your arms look as strong as stone. If you think you must be harsh with me, then be harsh, so long as you hold me.” Her hands touched his face; sparks seemed to leap from her fingers.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Without thinking he channeled the flows still linked to him, and suddenly she was staggering back, eyes wide with startlement, as if a wall of air pushed her. It was air, he realized; he did things without knowing what he was doing more often than he did know. At least, once done, he could usually remember how to do them again.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The unseen, moving wall scraped ripples along the carpet, sweeping along Berelain’s discarded robe, a boot he had tossed aside undressing, and a red leather footstool supporting an open volume of Eban Vandes’s <span class="calibre18">The History of the Stone of Tear</span>, pushing them along as it forced her almost to the wall, fenced her in. Safely away from him. He tied off the flow—that was all he could think to call what he did—and no longer needed to maintain the shield himself. For a moment he studied what he had done, until he was sure he could repeat it. It looked useful, especially the tying off.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Dark eyes still wide, Berelain felt along the confines of her invisible prison with trembling hands. Her face was almost as white as her skimpy silk shift. Footstool, boot and book lay at her feet, jumbled with the robe.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“Much as I regret it,” he told her, “we will not speak again, except in public, my Lady.” He really did regret it. Whatever her motives, she was beautiful. <span class="calibre18">Burn me, I</span> am <span class="calibre18">a fool!</span> He was not sure how he meant that—for thinking of her beauty, or for sending her away. “In fact, it is best you arrange your journey back to Mayene as soon as possible. I promise you that Tear will not trouble Mayene again. You have my word.” It was a promise good only for his lifetime, perhaps only as long as he stood in the Stone, but he had to offer her something. A bandage for wounded pride, a gift to take her mind off being afraid.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">But her fear was already under control, on the outside, at least. Honesty and openness filled her face, all efforts at allure gone. “Forgive me. I
have handled this badly. I did not mean to offend. In my country, a woman may speak her mind to a man freely, or he to her. Rand, you must know that you are a handsome man, tall and strong. I would be the one made of stone, if I did not see it, and admire. Please do not send me away from you. I will beg it, if you wish.” She knelt smoothly, like a dance. Her expression still said she was being open, confessing everything, but on the other hand, in kneeling she had managed to tug her already precarious gown down until it looked in real danger of falling off. “Please, Rand?”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Even sheltered in emptiness as he was, he gaped at her, and it had nothing to do with her beauty or her near undress. Well, only partly. If the Defenders of the Stone had been half as determined as this woman, half as steadfast in purpose, ten thousand Aiel could never have taken the Stone.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I am flattered, my Lady,” he said diplomatically. “Believe me, I am. But it would not be fair to you. I cannot give you what you deserve.” <span class="calibre18">And let her make of that what she will</span>.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Outside in the darkness, a cock crowed.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">To Rand’s surprise, Berelain suddenly stared past him, eyes as big as teacups. Her mouth dropped open, and her slim throat corded with a scream that would not come. He spun, the yellow-red sword flashing back into his hands.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Across the room, one of the stand-mirrors threw his reflection back at him, a tall young man with reddish hair and gray eyes, wearing only white linen smallclothes and holding a sword carved from fire. The reflection stepped out onto the carpet, raising its sword.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">I</span> have <span class="calibre18">gone mad</span>. Thought drifted on the borders of the Void. <span class="calibre18">No! She saw it. It’s real!</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Movement to his left caught the corner of his eye. He twisted before he could think, sword sweeping up in The Moon Rises Over Water. The blade slashed through the shape—his shape—climbing out of a mirror on the wall. The form wavered, broke up like dust motes floating on air, vanished. Rand’s reflection appeared in the mirror again, but even as it did, it put hands on the mirror frame. He was aware of movement in mirrors all around the room.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Desperately, he stabbed at the mirror. Silvered glass shattered, yet it seemed that the image shattered first. He thought he heard a distant scream inside his head, his own voice screaming, fading. Even as shards of mirror fell, he lashed out with the One Power. Every mirror in the room exploded silently, fountaining glass across the carpet. The dying scream in his head echoed again and again, sending shivers down his back. It was
his voice; he could hardly believe it was not himself who made the sounds.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He spun back to face the one that had gotten out, just in time to meet its attack, Unfolding the Fan to counter Stones Falling Down the Mountain. The figure leaped back, and suddenly Rand realized it was not alone. As quickly as he had smashed the mirrors, two more reflections had escaped. Now they stood facing him, three duplicates of himself down to the puckered round scar on his side, all staring at him, faces twisted with hatred and contempt, with a strange hunger. Only their eyes seemed empty, lifeless. Before he could take a breath, they rushed at him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand stepped sideways, pieces of broken mirror slicing his feet, ever sideways, from stance to stance and form to form, trying to face only one at a time. He used everything Lan, Moiraine’s Warder, had taught him of the sword in their daily practice.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Had the three fought together, had they supported one another, he would have died in the first minute, but each fought him alone, as if the others did not exist. Even so, he could not stop their blades entirely; in minutes blood ran down the side of his face, his chest, his arms. The old wound tore open, adding its flow to stain his smallclothes with red. They had his skill as well as his face, and they were three to his one. Chairs and tables toppled; priceless Sea Folk porcelain shattered on the carpet.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He felt his strength ebbing. None of his cuts was major by itself, except the old wound, but all together . . . . He never thought of calling for help from the Aiel outside his door. The thick walls would stifle even a death scream. Whatever was done, he must do alone. He fought wrapped in the cold emotionlessness of the Void, but fear scraped at its boundaries like wind-lashed branches scratching a window in the night.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">His blade slipped past its opponent to slash across a face just below the eyes—he could not help wincing; it was his face—its owner sliding back just far enough to avoid a killing cut. Blood welled from the gash, veiling mouth and chin in dark crimson, but the ruined face did not change expression, and its empty eyes never flickered. It wanted him dead the way a starving man wanted food.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">Can anything kill them?</span> All three bled from the wounds he had managed to inflict, but bleeding did not seem to slow them as he knew it was slowing him. They tried to avoid his sword, but did not appear to realize they had been hurt. <span class="calibre18">If they have been</span>, he thought grimly. <span class="calibre18">Light, if they bleed, they can be hurt! They must!</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He needed a respite, a moment to catch his breath, to gather himself.
Suddenly he leaped away from them, onto the bed, rolling across its width. He sensed rather than saw blades slashing the sheets, barely missing his flesh. Staggering, he landed on his feet, caught at a small table to steady himself. The shining, gold-worked silver bowl on the table wobbled. One of his doubles had climbed onto the torn bed, kicking goose feathers as it padded across warily, sword at the ready. The other two came slowly around, still ignoring each other, intent only on him. Their eyes glistened like glass.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Rand shuddered as pain stabbed his hand on the table. An image of himself, no more than six inches tall, drew back its small sword. Instinctively, he grabbed the figure before it could stab again. It writhed in his grip, baring teeth at him. He became aware of small movements all around the room, of small reflections by the score stepping out of polished silver. His hand began to numb, to grow cold, as if the thing were sucking the warmth out of his flesh. The heat of <span class="calibre18">saidin</span> swelled inside him; a rushing filled his head, and the heat flowed into his icy hand.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Suddenly the small figure burst like a bubble, and he felt something flow into him—from the bursting—some little portion of his lost strength. He jerked as tiny jolts of vitality seemed to pelt him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">When he raised his head—wondering why he was not dead—the small reflections he had half-glimpsed were gone. The three larger stood wavering, as if his gain in strength had been their loss. Yet as he looked up, they steadied on their feet and came on, if more cautiously.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He backed away, thinking furiously, sword threatening first one and then another. If he continued to fight them as he had been, they would kill him sooner or later. He knew that as surely as he knew he was bleeding. But something linked the reflections. Absorbing the small one—the far-off thought made him queasy, but that was what it had been—had not only brought the others with it, it had also affected the bigger, for a moment at least. If he could do the same to one of them, it might destroy all three.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Even thinking of absorbing them made him vaguely aware of wanting to empty his stomach, but he did not know another way. <span class="calibre18">I don’t know this way. How did I do it? Light, what did I do?</span> He had to grapple with one of them, to touch it at least; he was somehow sure of that. But if he tried to get that close, he would have three blades through him in as many heartbeats. <span class="calibre18">Reflections. How much are they still reflections?</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Hoping he was not being a fool—if he was, he might well be a dead one—he let his sword vanish. He was ready to bring it back on the instant,
but when his carved-fire blade winked out of existence, the others’ did, too. For a moment, confusion painted three copies of his face, one a bloody ruin. But before he could seize one of them, they leaped for him, all four crashing to the floor in a tangle of grappling limbs, rolling across the glass-littered carpet.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Cold soaked into Rand. Numbness crept along his limbs, through his bones, until he barely felt the shards of mirror, the slivers of porcelain grinding into his flesh. Something close to panic flickered across the emptiness surrounding him. He might have made a fatal mistake. They were larger than the one he had absorbed, and they were drawing more heat from him. And not only heat. As he grew colder, the glassy gray eyes staring into his took on life. With chill certainty he knew that if he died, that would not end the struggle. The three would turn on one another until only one remained, and that one would have his life, his memories, would <span class="calibre18">be</span> him.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Stubbornly he fought, struggling harder the weaker he became. He pulled on <span class="calibre18">saidin</span>, trying to fill himself with its heat. Even the stomach-turning taint was welcome, for the more of it he felt, the more <span class="calibre18">saidin</span> suffused him. If his stomach could rebel, then he was still alive, and if he lived, he could fight. <span class="calibre18">But how? How? What did I do before? Saidin</span> raged through him till it seemed that if he survived his attackers, he would only be consumed by the Power. <span class="calibre18">How did I do it?</span> All he could do was pull at <span class="calibre18">saidin</span>, and try . . . reach . . . strain . . . .</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">One of the three vanished—Rand felt it slide into him; it was as if he had fallen from a height, flat onto stony ground—and then the other two together. The impact flung him onto his back, where he lay staring up at the worked plaster ceiling with its gilded bosses, lay luxuriating in the fact that he was still breathing.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">The Power still swelled in every crevice of his being. He wanted to spew up every meal he had ever eaten. He felt so alive that, by comparison, life not soaked in <span class="calibre18">saidin</span> was living a shadow. He could smell the beeswax of the candles, and the oil in the lamps. He could feel every fiber of the carpet against his back. He could feel every gash in his flesh, every cut, every nick, every bruise. But he held on to <span class="calibre18">saidin</span>.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">One of the Forsaken had tried to kill him. Or all of them had. It must have been that, unless the Dark One was free already, in which case he did not think he would have faced anything as easy or as simple as this. So he held his link to the True Source. <span class="calibre18">Unless I did it myself. Can I hate what I am enough to try to kill myself? Without even knowing it? Light, I have to learn to control it. I have to!</span></span></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Painfully, he pushed himself up. Leaving bloody footprints on the carpet, he limped to the stand where <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> rested. Blood from hundreds of cuts covered him. He lifted the sword, and its glassy length glowed with the Power flowing into it. The Sword That Is Not a Sword. That blade, apparently glass, would cut as well as the finest steel, yet <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> truly was not a sword, but instead a remnant of the Age of Legends, a <span class="calibre18">sa’angreal</span>. With the aid of one of the relatively few <span class="calibre18">angreal</span> known to have survived the War of the Shadow and Breaking of the World, it was possible to channel flows of the One Power that would have burned the channeler to ash without it. With one of the even rarer <span class="calibre18">sa’angreal</span>, the flows could be increased as much over those possible with an <span class="calibre18">angreal</span> as an <span class="calibre18">angreal</span> increased them over channeling naked. And <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span>, usable only by a man, linked to the Dragon Reborn through three thousand years of legend and prophecy, was one of the most powerful <span class="calibre18">sa’angreal</span> ever made. Holding <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> in his hands, he could level a city’s walls at a blow. Holding <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> in his hands, he could face even one of the Forsaken. <span class="calibre18">It</span> was <span class="calibre18">them. It must have been.</span></span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Abruptly he realized he had not heard a sound from Berelain. Half fearing to see her dead, he turned.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Still kneeling, she flinched. She had donned her robe again, and hugged it around her like steel armor, or stone walls. Face as white as snow, she licked her lips. “Which one are . . . ?” She swallowed and began again. “Which one . . . ?” She could not finish it.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I am the only one there is,” he said gently. “The one you were treating as if we were betrothed.” He meant it to soothe her, perhaps make her smile—surely a woman as strong as she had shown herself to be could smile, even facing a blood-drenched man—but she bent forward, pressing her face to the floor.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“I apologize humbly for having most grievously offended you, Lord Dragon.” Her breathy voice did sound humble, and frightened. Completely unlike herself. “I beg you to forget my offense, and forgive. I will not bother you again. I swear it, my Lord Dragon. On my mother’s name and under the Light, I swear it.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">He loosed the knotted flow; the invisible wall confining her became a momentary stir that ruffled her robe. “There is nothing to forgive,” he said wearily. He felt very tired. “Go as you wish.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">She straightened hesitantly, stretched out a hand, and gave a relieved gasp when it encountered nothing. Gathering the skirts of her robe, she began to pick her way across the glass-littered carpet, shards grating under her velvet slippers. Short of the door, she stopped, facing him with an
obvious effort. Her eyes could not quite meet his. “I will send the Aiel in to you, if you wish. I could send for one of the Aes Sedai to tend your wounds.”</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22"><span class="calibre18">She would as soon be in a room with a Myrddraal, now, or the Dark One himself, but she’s no milksop.</span> “Thank you,” he said quietly, “but no. I would appreciate it if you told no one what happened here. Not yet. I will do what needs to be done.” <span class="calibre18">It</span> had <span class="calibre18">to be the Forsaken</span>.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“As my Lord Dragon commands.” She gave him a tight curtsy and hurried out, perhaps afraid he might change his mind about letting her go.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">“As soon the Dark One himself,” he murmured as the door closed behind her.</span></div>
<div class="p-indent"><span class="calibre22">Limping to the foot of the bed, he lowered himself into the chest there and laid <span class="calibre18">Callandor</span> across his knees, bloody hands resting on the glowing blade. With that in his hands, even one of the Forsaken would fear him. In a moment he would send for Moiraine to Heal his wounds. In a moment he would speak to the Aiel outside, and become the Dragon Reborn again. But for now, he only wanted to sit, and remember a shepherd named Rand al’Thor.</span></div>
